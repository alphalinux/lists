Hi,
<BR>
<P>I've successfully assembled my first alpha last friday.
<BR>
I bought a used 164LX-board with a 533Mhz 21164a and 128MB ECC-SDRAM.
<BR>
It is now in a 300W ATX-case together with a Western Digital 10,2GB HD and a
<BR>
40x Teac-CDROM, both E-IDE. The graphics-card is a Voodoo 3 2000PCI with
<BR>
16MB-SGRAM, because I haven't found another PCI-card.
<BR>
My Alpha boots without problems into AlphaBIOS and I've already installed
<BR>
Debian/GNU Linux 2.1, which runs nicely.
<BR>
<P>Now I want to copy my home-directory from my Pentium 120-PC to my new alpha
<BR>
by using plip over a parallel cable.
<BR>
The PC is set up correctly, because he was connected with a 386 over my
<BR>
parallel cable.
<BR>
<P>But my Alpha's parallel port does not seem to be allright:
<BR>
In AlphaBIOS LPT1 is shown as SPP at 0x3bc and IRQ 7, but Linux (2.0.36,
<BR>
2.2.5 and 2.2.10) doesn't recognize the IRQ. When I do &quot;cat &gt; /dev/lp0&quot; dmesg
<BR>
says  &quot;lp0 off-line&quot;, so I assume that the driver works still correctly,
<BR>
because no printer is attached. This also seems to be the case why cat has
<BR>
to be killed and doesn't exit on Ctrl-D.
<BR>
<P>But PLIP doesn't work, because it needs an IRQ. When I set the IRQ
<BR>
for parport0 to 7 (as shown in AlphaBIOS) by cat-ting it to
<BR>
/proc/parport/0/irq, the lp-driver still works for some time and again says
<BR>
&quot;lp0 off-line&quot;. But when I then kill &quot;cat &gt; /dev/lp0&quot; with Ctrl-C, my alpha
<BR>
hangs *hard*. Neither Ctrl-Alt-Del(for init) nor Alt-SysRq works at this
<BR>
moment. The cursor still blinks.
<BR>
This also happens when I try to ping over the PLIP link, either from
<BR>
the alpha or from the PC. According to ifconfig the PC has received some
<BR>
packets, but wasn't able to send some back (ifconfig on the PC):
<BR>
RX packets:29 errors:0 dropped:1 overruns:0 frame:0
<BR>
TX packets:0 errors:68 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:68
<BR>
<P>I can't try remote-shutdown, because the plip-link is the only
<BR>
net-connection the alpha has.
<BR>
I hope some of you on this mailing-list can help me.
<BR>
<P>Besides this problem, my first experiences with alphalinux are very well.
<BR>
In the mailing-lists on alphalinux I've read that the Sb64 doesn't run on
<BR>
alphas because of some PCI-confusion. Now my question is, which soundcards
<BR>
do work on the alpha ??
<BR>
<P>I hope my english isn't too bad and I'd be happy about a solution for my
<BR>
problem.
<BR>
Greetings and happy alpha-linuxing,
<BR>
Marius Hillenbrand

alphalinux - what numbers do you want to crunch today ?
