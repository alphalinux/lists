<P>
So I notices something rather strange today, now I only have Tsunami based
<BR>
SMP machines so I can't speak for other SMP hardware, however:
<BR>
<P>I noticed that regardless of how many processors are present in the box
<BR>
(this is either UP2000 or DP264) /proc/cpuinfo reports &quot;cpus detected 2&quot;,
<BR>
followed by &quot;CPUs probed x&quot; where x is the real number of CPUs, now it
<BR>
does this even on a machine with 1 cpu and a uni kernel!
<BR>
<P>Now this value comes from hwrpb-&gt;nr_processors, which seems to be related
<BR>
to the INIT_HWRPB struct in aboot (am I even close here ?)
<BR>
<P>So I guess the question is does anybody know why this is reporting 2 on
<BR>
SMP Tsunami machines? regardless of what's really there?
<BR>
<P>thanks,
<BR>
--rdp
<BR>
<P>P.S. In case your interested, this all start with a problem of somebody
<BR>
porting some code over to AlphaLinux, they wanted to know the # of CPUs in
<BR>
the box so tried get_nprocs() and get_nprocs_conf() both of which return 0
<BR>
on Alpha as they seem to parse /proc/cpuinfo and count the number of
<BR>
instances of the word 'processor'. So the Alphas are always running with 0
<BR>
CPUs!
