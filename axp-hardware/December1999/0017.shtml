Hi,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for replying.  The machine currently has 96MB of FPM 60ns SIMMS.
<BR>
This is the same memory that was in the system when I got it and I have
<BR>
since tested them to be fine. The system actually had 128MB but 32 of it was
<BR>
70ns so I moved them out. I didn't state it before, but the leds that stay
<BR>
lighted are D10,D12,D15,D16,D17.  Also, since I am new at this, how would I
<BR>
talk over a serial port?
<BR>

<P>Well, you didn't specifically state it, so is there memory in the machine?
<BR>
and if so what type?

<P><P>The minimun should be Motherboard, CPU, memory. You might not even need

video as SRM will talk over the serial port if no VGA/Keyboard is found.
<BR>
I'm not sure which firmware as AS400 uses (SRM or ARC). Anybody?
