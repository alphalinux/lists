<P>Hi!
<BR>
<P>Well, I've also went through documentation for UX and didn't find
<BR>
anything about serial console support. However in Alpha/Linux FAQ
<BR>
question 12.4 is:
<BR>
<P>&lt;quote&gt;
<BR>
12.4 Can Linux/Alpha Run Without Graphics Card?
<BR>
<P>The firmware can be controlled over a serial line terminal at 9600 Baud
<BR>
and it is possible to boot Linux/Alpha in that manner, but
<BR>
Linux itself does not currently support headless boots. There are kernel
<BR>
patches floating on the net that add this functionality,
<BR>
however. 
<BR>
&lt;/quote&gt;
<BR>
<P>What about this? 
<BR>
<P>The point is, that I'm having few machines without keyboards and monitors
<BR>
and hooking them up every time you need to change something is a pain.
<BR>
Possibility to control BIOS over serial line would be a great advantage.
<BR>
There is a solution (www.realweasel.com) but it kind of costly (the price
<BR>
for the card is 250$ plus shipping). 
<BR>
<P>Best regards,
