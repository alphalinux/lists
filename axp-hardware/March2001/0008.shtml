Hi,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Ok, here are the necessary steps to netboot an Alpha:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks - your stuff is very helpful.
</EM><BR>
<P>Great, good to hear ;-)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Question: the &quot;-flags&quot; option to the boot command
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is this where I can specify additional kenal options
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at boot/load time?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, indeed. The SRM &quot;boot -flags&quot; mechanism is used by the Linux-kernel for
<BR>
passing options. You can put whatever you like in there, although there is a limit
<BR>
on the length. The limit is 256 characters as in arch/alpha/kernel/setup.c.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Right now, I'm muddling my way through settig up my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Intel box to cross compile the kernal. I'm getting there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; learned a few things from the &quot;ARM&quot; hand held development
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; web pages. I'm trying vrs 2.4.3
</EM><BR>
<P>you should be aware, that 2.4.3 does not compile on alpha without special patches.
<BR>
The proper patch is available via ftp on:
<BR>
<P>ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.3aa1/00_alpha-numa-1
<BR>
<P>if IIRC. You should check the recent linux-kernel mailing-list archives.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I think being able to build my own kernal will make life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quite a bit easier.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks for the tips on root-on-nfs stuff, I need that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BTW - RH 7.0 - uses xinet.d and does not come with bootp
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so I had to get it off the net.
</EM><BR>
<P>hmm. I don't use red hat, so all of my comments should be adated to any non-UNIX
<BR>
environment ;-)
<BR>
Anyway, bootpd should be buildable right out of the box. I can't imagine, that red hat
<BR>
ships a inetd-replacement, that doesn't offer inetd functionality.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I did find another boot image and it gets further, I guess
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's something to do with the real time clock. Seems like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there should be a switch some where for the oddities of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4/275 machines with sable cpus.
</EM><BR>
<P>Can't tell, what the problem is. As far as real-time clocks are concerned, make sure
<BR>
to build *any* linux-alpha kernels with 
<BR>
<P>CONFIG_RTC=y
<BR>
<P>Otherwise, your system date and time might be completely off. If the kernel contains the
<BR>
above option, it's wise to set the systems's date with date(1) to the correct time and date and
<BR>
copy that back to the HW's RTC. Use hwclock --systohc for that. IIRC, red hat uses to
<BR>
hwclock --hctosys to set the systems date&amp;time at boot. You may want to revisit the
<BR>
bootscripts for that.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I've also found that using tcpdump helps find many problems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as I can see what is/is not happening on the wire.
</EM><BR>
<P>As far as bootpd is concerned, the daemon itself comes with a fairly detailed debugging
<BR>
flag. Check the manpage for your preferred debug-level. Output goes ( as always ) to
<BR>
the logs. I've found that quite useful. Debugging NFS transactions on ethernet framelevel
<BR>
can be a bit bitchy, but I'm sure you knew that already ;-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Again, thanks - I'll let you know when I get stuck.
</EM><BR>
<P>Go ahead ;-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If all goes right, I'm going to try to port the SDK
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for eBookman to alpha. (<A HREF="http://www.franklin.com/ebookman">http://www.franklin.com/ebookman</A>)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's where I work and the product I've been workig on for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the last 15 months or so. I'm one of the core developers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the project. At work we have intel Linux boxes and now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have an alpha I want to see if I can do it.
</EM><BR>
<P>For any serious development work on apps, make sure you checked the compaq compilers.
<BR>
They are free to download for non-commercial use, and they provide *much* better
<BR>
binary code. I like them a lot, although I can't use them for my stuff ( kernel-related, and
<BR>
linux-kernels don't build with anything else but GCC ).
<BR>
I've been told, that on alpha, especially their C++ compiler provides much better code and
<BR>
less bugs/deficiencies, although I can't verify that - I simply don't C++.
<BR>
