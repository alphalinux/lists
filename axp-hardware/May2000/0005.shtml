&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greetings,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just picked up a 21164 LX Motherboard + 533MHz CPU for
<BR>
$200 the other day, so I just had to try to get this thing up
<BR>
and running.  I've since bought the ATX case, floppy, Matrox
<BR>
Millenium II PCI video card, cd-rom, 8GB IDE hard disk, and
<BR>
two 72x8MB SDRAM modules for 128MB total memory.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my first experience with the DEC Alpha, so please
<BR>
bear with me if I use any wrong nomenclature or whatever.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I put everything together, crossed my fingers, and
<BR>
powered up my new box.  Fans spun, and the hard disk and cdrom
<BR>
spun up, but there was absolutely no video signal.  My monitor
<BR>
shows a general grayness if there's no VGA sync signal, and
<BR>
at powerup there is a brief flicker to black, but then the gray
<BR>
comes back like there's no video signal.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've tested the video card on a different box after this, and
<BR>
the card works fine.  I'm also using the same monitor, so I don't
<BR>
think it's a problem with the VGA card or monitor.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went through the MB manual several times to see if there
<BR>
were any jumper settings I've missed, but I can't find any.  I've
<BR>
also unhooked the floppy, hard disk and cdrom, to see if these could
<BR>
be interfering with the system somehow.  That didn't help.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then tried setting the jumper to the fail-safe BIOS, and
<BR>
to my relief, I heard the sequence of 1-2-3 beeps that is supposed
<BR>
to happen during bootup.  So, my first question is, does this indicate
<BR>
that the CPU may be okay?  Because there's no video, I can't tell what's
<BR>
going on inside.  Does this also indicate that the memory is okay?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My other question deals with video cards.  Is there any reason
<BR>
to believe this matrox card won't work?  I assume just about any vga
<BR>
card should at least work during bootup and bios initialization.  Does
<BR>
anyone have any input about this?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the manual mentions that error messages may be sent
<BR>
out the serial port during bootup.  Can I interface this with my
<BR>
other linux boxes via a null modem to try to get the messages over
<BR>
the port?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a last resort of trying to get things right, I even 
<BR>
unscrewed my motherboard from the ATX case, and lifted it slightly,
<BR>
in case ground loops were causing any problems.  this didn't seem
<BR>
to help.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two other questions, too.  Firstly, I was told it was
<BR>
a 533MHz CPU when I bought it, so I have the jumpers set for this
<BR>
speed.  I've tried the other speed settings (466 and 600) but they
<BR>
didn't work either.  Is there a way to verify the 533MHz speed?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, there are jumpers on the MB to change the cache size
<BR>
from 2MB, but they are all 'reserved' for later options.  Should I 
<BR>
just assume I have the 2MB cache?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is there a way to tell if the memory is okay?  Basically,
<BR>
I'd like to know what the series of beeps implies is working.  CPU
<BR>
and/or memory?  maybe my PCI bridge is broken so hence no video?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks alot for any and all replies.  Once again, this is
<BR>
my first time using an alpha, and I've just joined this list yesterday,
<BR>
(although I've scanned through the archives) so please bear with me
<BR>
if I've breached any protocol or whatever :-)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheers,
<BR>
