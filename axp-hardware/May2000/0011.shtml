<P>
<EM>&gt; 	So, I put everything together, crossed my fingers, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; powered up my new box.  Fans spun, and the hard disk and cdrom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spun up, but there was absolutely no video signal.  My monitor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shows a general grayness if there's no VGA sync signal, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at powerup there is a brief flicker to black, but then the gray
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comes back like there's no video signal.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	I've tested the video card on a different box after this, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the card works fine.  I'm also using the same monitor, so I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think it's a problem with the VGA card or monitor.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which PCI slot is the graphics card in?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 	I went through the MB manual several times to see if there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were any jumper settings I've missed, but I can't find any.  I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also unhooked the floppy, hard disk and cdrom, to see if these could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be interfering with the system somehow.  That didn't help.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	I then tried setting the jumper to the fail-safe BIOS, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to my relief, I heard the sequence of 1-2-3 beeps that is supposed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to happen during bootup.  So, my first question is, does this indicate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the CPU may be okay?  Because there's no video, I can't tell what's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going on inside.  Does this also indicate that the memory is okay?
</EM><BR>
<P>Probably, that means the FSB code has been loaded and at that point it's
<BR>
actually looking at the floppy for the firmware image. Have you tried
<BR>
putting either AlphaBIOS (lx164nt.rom) or SRM console (lx164srm.rom) onto
<BR>
a FAT floppy for this?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	My other question deals with video cards.  Is there any reason
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to believe this matrox card won't work?  I assume just about any vga
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; card should at least work during bootup and bios initialization.  Does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyone have any input about this?
</EM><BR>
<P>Matrox cards work fine.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	Thirdly, the manual mentions that error messages may be sent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out the serial port during bootup.  Can I interface this with my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other linux boxes via a null modem to try to get the messages over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the port?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes you can...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	I have two other questions, too.  Firstly, I was told it was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a 533MHz CPU when I bought it, so I have the jumpers set for this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speed.  I've tried the other speed settings (466 and 600) but they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; didn't work either.  Is there a way to verify the 533MHz speed?
</EM><BR>
<P>If you remove the heatsick it should be stamped on the top (at least I
<BR>
know the Samsung one's are).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	Also, there are jumpers on the MB to change the cache size
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from 2MB, but they are all 'reserved' for later options.  Should I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just assume I have the 2MB cache?
</EM><BR>
<P>If it came as a 2 meg that it probably is a two meg. There were two
<BR>
version of the LX board, LX-2 and LX-4. The later having 4MB of
<BR>
cache. However....upgrading one to the other would be a difficult process!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	And is there a way to tell if the memory is okay?  Basically,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd like to know what the series of beeps implies is working.  CPU
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and/or memory?  maybe my PCI bridge is broken so hence no video?
</EM><BR>
<P>Try it in another machine? If I remember correctly the LX uses PC100 ECC
<BR>
memory DIMMs. If the memory is bad you should get 6 beeps from the
<BR>
motherboard during a normal startup (aka: no FSB jumper). You may want to
<BR>
try the MB with no memory and see if it produces the 6 beeps.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	Thanks alot for any and all replies.  Once again, this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my first time using an alpha, and I've just joined this list yesterday,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (although I've scanned through the archives) so please bear with me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if I've breached any protocol or whatever :-)
