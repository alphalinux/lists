<P>
ok, first of all, I want to apologize for the length of this message,
<BR>
and if it's somewhat offtopic on the axp-hardware list i'm sorry
<BR>
bout that too.
<BR>
<P>I have two linux puters - my primary i386 box running slackware 7.0
<BR>
(cokaygne), and a little alpha running redhat 6.0 (bent). (the alpha 
<BR>
is a VX40B-F2 by the way)
<BR>
<P>cokaygne has an el-cheapo ISAPNP ne2000 card, which after much
<BR>
frustration
<BR>
I have _finally_ got working properly. ne2k-diag.c recognizes it, the 
<BR>
kernel ne module recognizes it.. all is well after many headaches on
<BR>
that front. 
<BR>
<P>bent has a builtin ethernet that does both 10base2 and 10baseT;
<BR>
obviously
<BR>
I'm using the 10base2 to match the cheezy ne2k card on cokaygne. this
<BR>
card
<BR>
too is fully recognized as the eth0 device on bent, or so it seems.
<BR>
<P>Anyhow for the time being I am not trying to do anything fancy at all. 
<BR>
No DNS, no gateways, etc. I just want a barebones ultra minimalistic
<BR>
connection for now; I'm not going to worry about what else I might want
<BR>
to do with this tiny LAN until I can just manage to send one single 
<BR>
ping from one machine to the other. and so far, at that I have failed.
<BR>
<P>I am trying to use 192.168.1.0 as my little local net. cokaygne is to 
<BR>
be 192.168.1.1, bent is to be 192.168.1.2.
<BR>
<P>ok so here's the lowdown (edited for clarity): 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;cokaygne:~# route
<BR>
&nbsp;Kernel IP routing table
<BR>
&nbsp;Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref

<BR>
<P>I won't reproduce bent's because it is exactly the same. the command I
<BR>
am
<BR>
running at boot on cokaygne is: 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
<BR>
<P>the alpha does pretty much the same, as 192.168.1.2.
<BR>
<P>i think this should be sufficient. but this is what i never fail to get:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;PING 192.168.1.2 (192.168.1.2): 56 data bytes
<BR>
&nbsp;112 bytes from cokaygne.milk.org (192.168.1.1): Destination Host
<BR>
&nbsp;Unreachable
<BR>
&nbsp;Vr HL TOS  Len   ID Flg  off TTL Pro  cks      Src      Dst Data
<BR>

<BR>
<P>I have tried playing around with many different combinations of ifconfig
<BR>
and route commands, but no luck. I often do &quot;ifconfig eth0 down&quot; and
<BR>
start
<BR>
over again, trying something a little different every time, but no luck.
<BR>
here's some of what I have tried, much of it probably quite wrong (i
<BR>
continue to use cokaygne as the example, but i am always matching on
<BR>
bent)  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;route add -host 192.168.1.1 eth0 
<BR>
<P>which results in, along with the other route entries: 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref   
<BR>
Iface
<BR>
&nbsp;192.168.1.1     *               255.255.255.255 UH    0      0     
<BR>
eth0
<BR>
<P>But this fails as well. Just for the record, is there any point in
<BR>
making
<BR>
an individual host entry like this? I was under the impression that the
<BR>
single ifconfig line up above would be sufficient - cokaygne knows that
<BR>
it
<BR>
is 192.168.1.1, eth0 knows that it is on the network 192.168.1.0.. that
<BR>
is
<BR>
enough for it to get packets out to bent (192.168.1.2), assuming it too
<BR>
is 
<BR>
configured correctly.. am i wrong? do i really need any -host entries
<BR>
for
<BR>
such a simple setup? either way, making one didn't help.
<BR>
<P>I've tried all sorts of stuff. I've tried adding a -host for 192.168.1.2
<BR>
(bent) on cokaygne (stupid, i know). i've tried doing a route -net for
<BR>
192.168.1.0 as a few documents suggest, but this seems to be redundant -
<BR>
ifconfig seems to have already taken care of this by netmasking
<BR>
192.168.1.1; using route after it just creates a duplicate entry in the
<BR>
table for 192.168.1.0. 
<BR>
<P>i've tried specifying the broadcast address (192.168.1.255). I've tried
<BR>
all this and more, everything i can think of, everything that the NET-3
<BR>
howto and linux net admin guide seems to suggest for a very basic
<BR>
two-box
<BR>
setup like my own. but I continue to get the 'host unreachable' (ping),
<BR>
'no route to host' (telnet), et cetera. 
<BR>
<P>this has become incredibly frustrating. afaik, this SHOULD be working,
<BR>
even just with the simple ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.x netmask
<BR>
255.255.255.0 
<BR>
in place on both ends. but it's not.
<BR>
<P>a few people have already told me that they do not understand why what 
<BR>
i am doing would NOT be working, that all is kosher in theory...
<BR>
unfortunately it is not in practice.
<BR>
<P>let me explain a few more things to help narrow things down. 
<BR>
<P>tho I do indeed have a spotty super-el-cheapo ethernet card on
<BR>
the i386, I really don't think this is the source of the problem. both
<BR>
computers' /proc/interrupts values do go up on the host that is pinging;
<BR>
however there is no corresponding activity on the host being pinged. 
<BR>
<P>I have reason to believe that the problem is with the alpha. 
<BR>
<P>the alpha has both 10base2 and 10baseT on the same ethernet hardware.
<BR>
is it possible that it is trying to send out via the 10baseT? I have 
<BR>
tried using ifconfig like this:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;[bent]# ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.0 media 10base2
<BR>
<P>but i get this response:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;SIOCSIFMAP: Operation not supported
<BR>
<P>I got the alpha on the cheap without dox, without a CDROM, and with
<BR>
a very minimal RH installation without sources or anything. so
<BR>
unfortunately I can't rebuild the system now, to be more sure of it's
<BR>
integrity and make sure the network card is all properly configured.
<BR>
i'm not even certain what the ethernet card on the alpha is (tulip?),
<BR>
and don't how else I might ensure that everything is working with it. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
there is one, maybe significant, maybe meaningless, difference I have
<BR>
noted between the two machines while I try to ping. the output of 
<BR>
&quot;ifconfig eth0&quot; is different as follows:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;cokaygne (i386) sez:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;eth0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:00:B4:3C:2C:1E
<BR>

<BR>
<P>&nbsp;bent (alpha) sez:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;eth0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 08:00:2B:E4:3C:81
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inet addr:192.168.1.2  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interrupt:10 Base address:0x8800
<BR>
<P>so, while the output of ping -v is the same (&quot;unreachable&quot;), according
<BR>
to cokaygne it has indeed sent out the packets without errors. bent
<BR>
says it has sent no packets, and had nothing but errors.
<BR>
<P>and actually, I just myself noticed the &quot;frame:189&quot; bit in cokaygne's
<BR>
RX row, and learned something which is pretty interesting: when I 
<BR>
ping 192.168.1.1 from bent, this frame value (and it alone) DOES GO UP
<BR>
on
<BR>
cokaygne. so for the first time I have some proof that something IS
<BR>
going
<BR>
on on the wire between the two computers.. so i guess that maybe shoots
<BR>
down the alpha-is-using-10baseT theory right there..
<BR>
<P>finally, another strange thing which might have something to do with
<BR>
all this, is that when I do a &quot;ping localhost&quot; on the alpha, I get this
<BR>
strange output:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;PING localhost (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes
<BR>
&nbsp;64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): Echo Request
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=255 time=17.0 ms
<BR>
&nbsp;wrong data byte #8 should be 0x8 but was 0x7b
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c d e f 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1a 1b 1c 1d 1e 1f 20 21
<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;23 24 25 26 27 28 29 2a 2b
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2c 2d 2e 2f 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
<BR>
<P>this continues.. as the icmp_seq goes up, the only thing changing is the
<BR>
wrong data byte message (data byte #8 999/1000 times, but ocassionally a
<BR>
data byte #9 in there):
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;wrong data byte #8 should be 0x8 but was 0xf
<BR>
&nbsp;wrong data byte #8 should be 0x8 but was 0xdc
<BR>
&nbsp;wrong data byte #9 should be 0x9 but was 0x84
<BR>
&nbsp;wrong data byte #8 should be 0x8 but was 0xd6
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;...etc etc etc
<BR>
<P>again, like some of the other weirdness it may just be some alpha
<BR>
quirk that is not-too-important.. or perhaps it is sending the same 
<BR>
sort of wrong data bytes over eth0, and cokaygne is scoffing at em.. i
<BR>
really don't know, i'm far from a guru. alot of this is greek to me.
<BR>
<P>now, having gathered just about all the information I possibly can,
<BR>
I am completely stuck. I have no idea what the problem is, or what I 
<BR>
can try doing to fix it. if anyhow can draw any inferences from the
<BR>
above information, i would be more than just happy to hear about em.
<BR>
if/when i get these machines pinging each other i'll be literally 
<BR>
jumping for joy.
<BR>
<P>if anyone is willing to help i'd gladly post any other information (ie
<BR>
output from specific programs / files etc) that might help to 
<BR>
narrow it down. i am willing to try just about anything to make these 
<BR>
computers be friendly with each other.
<BR>
<P>a big thank you to anyone who actually read through this longwinded
<BR>
beast of a message. ;)
