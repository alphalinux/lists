<EM>&gt; Hi,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since it looks like 72pin SIMMs are not going to get any cheaper, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; figure I may as well upgrade the memory in my XL300 now.  Since I've had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problems getting parity memory from local &quot;PC&quot; dealers to work, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thought I'd look for a place that knows it's to be used in an alpha and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can guarantee it will work.  Does anyone know of a place, preferably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really cheap? :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>www.pricewatch.com ?? and then go from there, just make sure you can
<BR>
return them!
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I also remember reading that the XL300 was capable of being upgraded to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 366MHz via a CPU daughterboard upgrade (there also was an XL400, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe, which, like the 266, was incompatible daughterboard-wise with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 300/366).  Anyway, is it still possible to get these 366MHz cards,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and how much of a performance increase is it over a 300MHz machine? 
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd imagine that you might be able to buy one from Compaq as they
<BR>
probably have spares around for support, but the cost would probably be
<BR>
huge and I don't think you'd get much bang for all that buck.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Back when I was deciding to buy this machine, there had been some very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nice, detailed docs with full specs for this particular machine up on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the DEC/Digital (as they still were at the time) website.  These seem to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have vanished completely - anyone know where these can still be found? 
</EM><BR>
<P>No, just took a look around myself, even searched, all it came up with was
<BR>
the MILOs on gatekeeper!
