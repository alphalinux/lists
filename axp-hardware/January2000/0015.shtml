Hi,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the problem is partly due to my switch after all.  I am
<BR>
using a cheap manual switch and what happens when I switch from one system
<BR>
to the next is that some residual &quot;noise&quot; causes the mouse and/or keyboard
<BR>
to become dysfunctional.  The problem is only apparent when I switch between
<BR>
different Opsys'.  For example going from NT to Linux or Win98 to NT or
<BR>
anyone of the above to Linux.  What I did to somewhat compensate is to
<BR>
connect Linux to port 4, NT to port 1 and Windows to Port 2.  That way I
<BR>
have a buffer of no signal on port 3  between the Linux box and the Windows
<BR>
boxes.  The only thing is that in switching from windows to Linux I have to
<BR>
change from the X console to a text only console and then back (say 5 to 1
<BR>
to 5) to reinitialize the mouse.  That is what I think is strange b/c at
<BR>
that point the effects of the KVM should be removed and it should be like I
<BR>
just removed the mouse and stuck it back in. I hope this is clear.
