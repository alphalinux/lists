Sorry all for abusing this list...

<P>The Milo image is the same as the one on the floppy.  I am actually using the
<BR>
image from the redhat 6.0 distribution. This time around I even formatted the dos
<BR>
partition, mounted it and copied the floppy's contents to it.
<BR>
<P>I think that there just must be something wrong with the motherboard -
<BR>
specifically the scsi adapter b/c sometimes when I go to scan the bus (from Arc),
<BR>
my hard drive is displayed three times.  Once in the beginning and then twice
<BR>
after finding the CDROM .  Unless my termination is just wrong (I seriously doubt
<BR>
this and I do have the IDs not conflicting) there just must be something bad
<BR>
about the board.  In the SRM console this problem does not exist and the bus is
<BR>
scanned properly but I get these machine check errors.  at logout frame
<BR>
address/vector 0x640 (whatever that means...). Is there some diagnostic tool out
<BR>
there I can use to check every inch of the machine or explain what the machine
<BR>
check codes mean?
<BR>
<P>Any insight anyone can give will be greatly appreciated as I would like to know
<BR>
if the machine is &quot;safe&quot; before I invest too much effort into it.  Right now
<BR>
Linux is completely configured (everything minus the network adapter) and
<BR>
everything behaves well (even X and my sound card).
