Hi,
<BR>
<P>Since it looks like 72pin SIMMs are not going to get any cheaper, I
<BR>
figure I may as well upgrade the memory in my XL300 now.  Since I've had
<BR>
problems getting parity memory from local &quot;PC&quot; dealers to work, I
<BR>
thought I'd look for a place that knows it's to be used in an alpha and
<BR>
can guarantee it will work.  Does anyone know of a place, preferably
<BR>
really cheap? :-)
<BR>
<P>I also remember reading that the XL300 was capable of being upgraded to
<BR>
366MHz via a CPU daughterboard upgrade (there also was an XL400, I
<BR>
believe, which, like the 266, was incompatible daughterboard-wise with
<BR>
the 300/366).  Anyway, is it still possible to get these 366MHz cards,
<BR>
and how much of a performance increase is it over a 300MHz machine? 
<BR>
<P>Back when I was deciding to buy this machine, there had been some very
<BR>
nice, detailed docs with full specs for this particular machine up on
<BR>
the DEC/Digital (as they still were at the time) website.  These seem to
<BR>
have vanished completely - anyone know where these can still be found? 
<BR>
<P>thanks-
<BR>
Wes.
