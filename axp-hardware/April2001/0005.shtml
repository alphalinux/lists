<P>
I have a 164LX alpha and it has a full size Digital (DEC) video card in it.
<BR>
X doesn't recognize the card. The guy I bought the box from told me that it
<BR>
a 16MB Oxygen video card. I replaced it with a generic Trident PCI 8MB video
<BR>
card. I do not get any video feed when I use the Trident card. The monitor
<BR>
stays in sleep mode.  I have video with the Oxygen card. The motherboard has
<BR>
2 32bit and 2 64bit PCI slots along with 2 ISA slots. The card was in the
<BR>
first 64 bit slot but has a 32bit connector (if that's the right word).  I'm
<BR>
attempting to get Suse Linux 7 to work. Does anyone know a good PCI card to
<BR>
use or why mine won't work. I'm using SRM. Also when I boot I only get the
<BR>
command line. X doesn't seem to want to come up but I have a feeling it's
<BR>
because of the card and not anything else. I just used the suse auto install
<BR>
not the expert mode.
<BR>
<P>(an aside rant)...the Yast installer is absolute garbage! As someone who
<BR>
works with NetWare, Mac's, and Windows it is absolutely garbage. I base this
<BR>
on my experience with loading Linux on x86 based boxes, such as Mandrake and
<BR>
Storm. Suse gives you the option to choose what you want to install but then
<BR>
won't allow you to deselect anything...(rant over...sorry about that)
