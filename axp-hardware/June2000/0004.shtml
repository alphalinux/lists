Hello,
<BR>
<P>I have an SX164 Alpha machine, and I'm pretty sure that the CPU fan is
<BR>
going bad. I've had the machine for 2 1/2 years now, and the CPU fan has
<BR>
been making noise, on and off, for the past few months. The noise is
<BR>
less frequent now, but the computer doesn't stay up for much longer than
<BR>
30-60 minutes at a time anymore, which seems to either be a
<BR>
circulation/temperature problem or, after searching through the
<BR>
archives, a problem with the CPU fan not spinning fast enough anymore.
<BR>
<P>So, assuming that the CPU fan is the culprit (feel free to correct me if
<BR>
you think i'm wrong), where would I find one of them? At first I thought
<BR>
that they would be a pretty generic fan, but after looking around, I
<BR>
haven't found any at all. Where would be a good place to look? The one
<BR>
place that I haven't tried yet is the company listed in the manual that
<BR>
I received with my computer since they're not geographically near me and
<BR>
they don't seem to have a web site. Any leads? (no pun intended)
<BR>
<P>Thanks in advance,
<BR>
<P>Matt
<BR>
