<EM>&gt; &gt; I have an SX164 Alpha machine, and I'm pretty sure that the CPU fan is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; going bad. I've had the machine for 2 1/2 years now, and the CPU fan has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; been making noise, on and off, for the past few months. The noise is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; less frequent now, but the computer doesn't stay up for much longer than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 30-60 minutes at a time anymore, which seems to either be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; circulation/temperature problem or, after searching through the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; archives, a problem with the CPU fan not spinning fast enough anymore.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Shutdown the system, then take the case off. While carefully watching
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the fan (for visable speed changes) turn the system on. Watch the fan,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does it &quot;look&quot; like it stays at the same speed (I know, this can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hard). Or if you have a temp probe to stick in there you can go that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; route. ;-)
</EM><BR>
<P>It's too bad that basic home repair tools don't included a strobe light.
<BR>
That would make it a lot easier to figure out how fast the fan was
<BR>
spinning and whether it changed.
<BR>
<P>I haven't noticed any changes in the fan speed. When I stuck a plain old
<BR>
wall thermometer in there, it came up with about 94 degrees F after
<BR>
about 20 minutes of uptime. (The humidity was 50%, according to the
<BR>
humidity gauge at the bottom of the thermometer.) Outside of the
<BR>
computer, it is cooler and more humid. Oh yeah, and I've been running
<BR>
with my case off for a month or two now. That was before the machine
<BR>
started &quot;not staying up&quot;. Around that time, I heard what sounded light a
<BR>
very faint MB alarm, which prompted me to take the cover off and leave
<BR>
it off. I haven't heard the &quot;alarm&quot;-ish sound at all recently.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Basically what I want to know is: Does the fan stop completely? or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; noticably slow down? and are you sure it was the cpu fan making noises
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (i.e. not the power supply fan, or another case fan). Also, by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;doesn't stay up&quot; do you mean it locks up, powers off or something else?
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Doesn't stay up&quot; means that it seems to power down in that the monitor
<BR>
goes into power save mode and the modem hangs up (if I'm dialed in
<BR>
somewhere). If I were to sit and look at the inside of the computer when
<BR>
it did this, I wouldn't notice any change since the fans and drives stay
<BR>
on until I hit the power switch.
<BR>
<P>The way that I decided the CPU fan was having problems was by, when I
<BR>
heard a grinding noise, I took a pencil and used the eraser to stop the
<BR>
CPU fan from moving. The noise stopped (and I'm pretty sure my machine
<BR>
went down in the manner described above).
