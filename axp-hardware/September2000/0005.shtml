Hello,
<BR>
<P>On Thu, 14 Sep 2000, you wrote:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I am new to the list and just wanted to say thanks for all the great
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information in the archives.  With your help I was able to convert two of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my alpha/nt workstations over to redhat 6.2.  I have 6 stations all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; together two are PC164 with 433 Mhz EV56, 128 MBram and the other four are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 500 mhz / pc164lx w/256 meg ram. I am planning on converting them all and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then putting them up for sale.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Cool. Those remaining LX's will make great servers. Running Linux that is :-)
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I am having a little trouble running the 3dlabs glint 500 TX board in these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stations.  Currently I have a generic S3 board in them.  The glint board
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; won't run at anything higher then 800x600 8bit color depth and the xserver
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; won't seen ram past 8meg these are 16 meg cards.
</EM><BR>
<P>These cards a picky... Since X needs to support the chipset AND the ramdac.
<BR>
The problem may be that ramdac support for that card isnt so great hence 
<BR>
the reduced resolution. Perfect example of this are the Accellgraphics
<BR>
GLINT 500TX boards. 16MB with a funky IBM ramdac that isnt supported.
<BR>
<P>Metrolink sells Xservers for linux/alpha , www.metrolink.com . They support
<BR>
a few 500TX based cards. The cost is cheap but for a few bucks more you
<BR>
can buy yourself a PCI voodoo 3000 that is fully supported on under X free
<BR>
and soon to have hardware acceleration. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Any help with the video would be great, also any idea what a fair price for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these boxes would be?  They have new 4.3 GB 7200 rpm scsi drives and new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CDROM and floppy drives as well.
</EM><BR>
<P>With that much ram which alone is $300 bucks I would say anywhere between
<BR>
$700-$900 would be a good price. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You would cry if you new what we paid for them back in 1996.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I know what they cost :-) and I know how horrible their 2D performance
<BR>
is. Honestly I think you're better off just getting a new card. 
<BR>
<P>Peter
