<P>
Recently, I've been having a little problem with my SX164, and I was
<BR>
curious if anyone could help me out. Here's what's going on...
<BR>
<P>I had my computer running for a week or so, then I powered down when I
<BR>
left for a weekend trip. Coming back, I hit the power button and was
<BR>
greeted by the normal whirring of my hard drives and fans, but the MB
<BR>
beeped 5 times, which the manual says is because there is no memory
<BR>
present. So I unplug everything from the back and pull the cover off to
<BR>
see if there's something like a screwdriver or rat or something crazy
<BR>
like that that snuck into the case over the weekend. Nothing like that.
<BR>
So I plug in the bare essentials and turn it on, and it gets past the
<BR>
diagnostics. Needless to say I'm confused. So I turn it off and plug
<BR>
stuff like my palm pilot cradle and network cable back in. 5 beeps. OK.
<BR>
Unplug network. successful boot. So I shrug my shoulders and plug the
<BR>
network cable back in before the network startup part of the linux boot
<BR>
script runs. Now I start getting weird errors from eth0. They disappear
<BR>
when I unplug the network cable again. I shutdown, pull the NIC out, and
<BR>
put it in a different PCI slot, plug in the network, and it boots fine.
<BR>
<P>So I leave it on for about a month. Then I shut it down overnight cause
<BR>
I want to start only having it on when I'm home to try to drop my
<BR>
electric bill some.
<BR>
<P>So now I go to turn it on, and it beeps 5 times. Remembering the last
<BR>
time this happened, I unplug the net connection, and it boots. I get all
<BR>
sorts of errors on one of my disks and it's making this really horrid
<BR>
clunking noise, so I shut it down and decide to try again later. Later
<BR>
comes, and no amount of unplugging devices or pulling cards helps. I
<BR>
haven't checked the RAM to see if it's allright yet, but since I got it
<BR>
to boot by unplugging the network cable, I figure that the RAM is OK.
<BR>
Needless to say, when the RAM is not in the machine, it beeps 5 times
<BR>
also. So it's not some sort of inverse RAM voodoo that's happening.
<BR>
<P>So my question is: what do the expert Alpha owners and users on this
<BR>
list think my problem is? Power supply? Motherboard? RAM? Chickens?
<BR>
<P>I can send more details about my system later, but I don't have them
<BR>
with me right now and don't remember all the particulars. Here's what I
<BR>
do remember:
<BR>
&nbsp;o  DEC NIC that uses tulip driver
<BR>
&nbsp;o  NCR SCSI card, don't remember which
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;+  2 x 4 GB SCSI drives -- one's Fujitsu and probably has some sort of
<BR>
problem that locks up my SCSI bus; the other's Seagate
<BR>
&nbsp;o  SB 16 (a really old card)
<BR>
&nbsp;o  SX 164, 533MHz
<BR>
&nbsp;o  Number 9 SVGA card.
<BR>
<P>Any help or advice is most appreciated.
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
Matt
