<P>
Greetings and welcome to axp-linux-perf, the mailing list for high performance
<BR>
on Linux-Alpha.
<BR>
<P>This list is intended as a discussion forum on the subject of maximizing the
<BR>
performance of software running under Linux on alpha processors.  There are
<BR>
already several mailing lists and at least one newsgroup devoted to Alpha
<BR>
Linux, but they are not intended for detailed discussions on performance
<BR>
tuning, and this list will help filter this type of content out of the
<BR>
background of hardware/kernel/installation messages that seem to comprise a lot
<BR>
of the content of those forums (fora?).
<BR>
<P>Because the platform has such strong floating point performance and less
<BR>
commercial software (browsers, office suites, etc) than Linux/Alpha, my guess
<BR>
is that the list content will lean in scientific/engineering discussions;
<BR>
because of the nature of Linux, there will probably be a focus on open-source
<BR>
software; but the list is not intended to be exclusive to either of these.
<BR>
Also, many subscribers showed an interest in Extreme Linux/Beowulf clusters, so
<BR>
we'll probably have some discussions on that topic.  Benchmarking is another
<BR>
subject that might come up here, but let's try to avoid the kind of childish
<BR>
competitiveness that characterizes much of this discussion on the mainstream
<BR>
lists.  (&quot;Oh yeah?  You think your code is hot?  Well MY code runs TWENTY TIMES
<BR>
FASTER on an 8-way AlphaServer 8400 than yours on a dual-PII!&quot;)
<BR>
<P>My dream is that the discussions on this list will give rise to some very high
<BR>
performance open-source libraries and software tools (in the spirit of Wesner
<BR>
and Goto's libffm and Goto's assembler BLAS), which will make it much easier
<BR>
and more economical to take full advantage of the awesome power of the alpha
<BR>
processor in many fields of research.  But you each have your own dreams, and
<BR>
this list will hopefully help you realize some of them.
<BR>
<P>Within 24 hours of the announcement, there were about 45 requests to be added
<BR>
to the list, including all four &quot;celebrities&quot; mentioned (Goto, Wesner,
<BR>
Hausmann, Payne), several DEC/Compaq employees, and one of the Sandia cplant
<BR>
team members (see the alphalinux.org high-performance page), so we have quite a
<BR>
team of experts here.
<BR>
<P>Now for some administrative details...  As you all know, the server currently
<BR>
hosting this list is kinda weak.  I have had four offers/suggestions for
<BR>
majordmo-style hosting, which would get rid of the lag times in
<BR>
additions/deletions, restrict posting to list members, and make life easier for
<BR>
me; I'll let the list know if such a change will take place.  Until then, try
<BR>
not to post the email list name on the web (though I guess it's inevitable in
<BR>
the archive), but direct people to me to be added.  This is because it is
<BR>
impossible with this list server to restrict posting to list members, and so
<BR>
anyone with a search engine can find the list name and spam it.  I've seen this
<BR>
happen to other lists on this server, and would rather it didn't happen to this
<BR>
one.
<BR>
<P>Rich Payne is putting up an archive of the list at alphalinux.org.
<BR>
<P>That's all from me, let the discussions begin!
<BR>
<P>Zeen,
<BR>
