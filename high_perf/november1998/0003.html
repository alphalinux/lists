Hello everyone,
<BR>
<P>I have some code I would like to optomize and I could use some suggestions
<BR>
and pointers for where to get started.
<BR>
<P>The function which is called most often and the most likely candidate
<BR>
for improvement (I think) calculates the distance between two vectors.
<BR>
The source I am currently using is locate below:
<BR>
<P>void r12(double *rij,double *x1,double *x2){
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;int i;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;double tmp1,tmp2;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;tmp2 = 0;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for(i=0;i&lt;3;i++){
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tmp1 = x1[i]-x2[i];
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tmp2 += tmp1*tmp1;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;tmp2 = sqrt(tmp2);
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*rij = tmp2;
<BR>
}
<BR>
<P>my guess is that this is a pretty classic problem and there are some nifty
<BR>
tricks I could apply in assembly to make this quite fast.  I'm fairly new
<BR>
to this though (my only assembly experience was with the MC6800 several
<BR>
years ago and I don't think I really understand all the issues involved
<BR>
with optomization on a RISC chip)  So my questions are,  is this the best
<BR>
form for the C code?  Is there an existing assembly routine for finding
<BR>
the distance between two vectors?  If not, any suggestions for the
<BR>
implementation of one?
<BR>
<P>Kind Regards,
<BR>
Jonathan DuBois
