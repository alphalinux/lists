<P>
At the moment it seems, at least to me, particularly difficult to pin down
<BR>
exactly how good or bad the free compilers (egcs/gcc) are against the DEC
<BR>
compilers unless one actually has access to the various machines. One can
<BR>
glean snippets here and there (from Dejanews say) but it isn't always
<BR>
clear what was done and the comparisons are but for a single program. 
<BR>
<P>What I would like to see established is an ongoing comparison of the
<BR>
compilers using some agreed 'trivial' or real world benchmarks in C and
<BR>
Fortran. I'm thinking of something along the lines of running say five
<BR>
programs in the following combinations on the same architecture;
<BR>
<P>o  Digital Unix &amp; DEC C (Fortran)
<BR>
o  Digital Unix &amp; egcs  (g77)
<BR>
o  Linux        &amp; egcs  (g77)  with compiled   libraries
<BR>
o  Linux        &amp; egcs  (g77)  with hand-coded libraries
<BR>
<P>I'd do this myself if I had access to such machines but I don't (at least
<BR>
not yet) but perhaps the list members could provide suitable programs and
<BR>
patch the information together ?  The only catch is this would have to be
<BR>
repeated where any component, particularly egcs, is subsequently updated.
<BR>
The influence of compiler options is also useful information.
<BR>
<P>I'm sure some people must be already be performing tests of this kind.
