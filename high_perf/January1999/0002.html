I got a similar 533 LX  from Microway and NDP FORTRAN.  After some testing, I
<BR>
returned the compiler and converted to DU.  Unfortunately, I can't say the
<BR>
conversion was an overwhelming success.  For all its flaws Linux is at least
<BR>
as good as DU if not better.  The performance of the DU compilers is quite
<BR>
good.  Other aspects are less satisfactory.  One of my motivations for the
<BR>
conversion was the very weak FORTRAN support in gdb.  As it turns out, the
<BR>
DU debuggers are as bad or worse.  There is no support at all for any intrinsics
<BR>
or the exponential.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print sin(x)**b
<BR>
<P>just produces error messages from ladebug(1).  dbx is even worse!
<BR>
<P>Performance of NDP FORTRAN was rather varied.  For simple tests such as dot 
<BR>
products and polynomial evaluations, it was within 10-20% of the DU performance.
<BR>
For another test, my actual problem, it was 3 times slower.  This is because
<BR>
of the handling of sqrt().  The problem has 3 sqrt() operations per loop
<BR>
iteration.  Interestingly, in some case g77 was faster than NDP, though in
<BR>
general NDP produced much quicker runs.  The documentation of NDP is a bit 
<BR>
weak though.  The only real discussion of the compiler flags is the tutorial
<BR>
that Fried has on the Microway web page.
<BR>
<P>In retrospect, unless you absolutely have to have the best possible performance
<BR>
on a wide range of problems, the NDP compiler is a pretty good choice.  It
<BR>
is certainly far cheaper than the almost $2500 license fee for DU &amp; Digital 
<BR>
FORTRAN.  Mike Warren et al report using the Gnu tools w/ the dgemm routines.
<BR>
If your problem is concentrated in a small loop consider just hand optimizing
<BR>
the code produced by gcc &amp; g77 after you get it written and debugged.
<BR>
<P>Note that although it appears to be possible to run DU code on a Linux box,
<BR>
there seem to be licensing issues.  I've not looked into these yet.  I
<BR>
will probably simply let DU generate assembly sequences which I will then
<BR>
move to Linux for assembly and linking.
