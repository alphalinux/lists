<P>
The list is alive! Great!

</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clear what was done and the comparisons are but for a single program.

<P>As a novice in the alphalinux world, I must say that it is really
<BR>
difficult for the begginer to obtain a valuable information, specyfying
<BR>
the differences between several compilers and their relative power.
<BR>
<P>We bought at the Observatory our first alpha station (based on the
<BR>
Microway PC164LX board (21164A/533MHz, 512 MB RAM) planning to use in
<BR>
under Linux. We hawe a lot of experience with i386 Linux machines so we
<BR>
hoped it will be easy to switch to alpha. After a month of reading and
<BR>
experimenting, I still don't know how good is egcs when compiling for
<BR>
alpha (-m21164a). I read hundrets of pages on alpha architecture, on
<BR>
optimizing for alpha , on NDP optimizing compilers etc. Finally I came to
<BR>
the conclusion, that Microway NDP Fortran seems to be the only tool,
<BR>
dedicated for this processor. They say in Microway, that they do not ofer
<BR>
a C compiler for alphalinux becouse egcs is preety good but from my
<BR>
investigations it seems that the best way is to produce .o files with egcs
<BR>
and then let NDP optimize it for particular architecture.
<BR>
<P>All above is a theoretical result, I am serching for arguments whether to
<BR>
buy NDP Fortran compiler from Microway or not. My work will be in C, so I
<BR>
will not use their product as a whole.
<BR>
Any comments from experienced users?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What I would like to see established is an ongoing comparison of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compilers using some agreed 'trivial' or real world benchmarks in C and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Fortran. I'm thinking of something along the lines of running say five
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; programs in the following combinations on the same architecture;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; o  Digital Unix &amp; DEC C (Fortran)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; o  Digital Unix &amp; egcs  (g77)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; o  Linux        &amp; egcs  (g77)  with compiled   libraries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; o  Linux        &amp; egcs  (g77)  with hand-coded libraries
</EM><BR>
<P>The above should be extended to NDP compilers!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'd do this myself if I had access to such machines but I don't (at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not yet) but perhaps the list members could provide suitable programs and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; patch the information together ?  
</EM><BR>
<P>It might be very helpful and informative both for beginers and experienced
<BR>
users. Please accept me as a volunteer for any tests on my AlphaLinux
<BR>
machine (21164A/533MHz/512MB RAM/no graphics/3,4 GB SCSI HD).
<BR>
I have some experience in Fortran (IBM360 etc) but strongly prefer to work
<BR>
in C. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm sure some people must be already be performing tests of this kind.
</EM><BR>
<P>I am not ready but I hope to be in a week or two.
<BR>
