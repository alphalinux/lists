Hello,
<BR>
<P>Now a new problem: I know how to fix the makefile, how do I build a new
<BR>
binary RPM?
<BR>
<P>I tried editing the Makefile in the BUILD/BLAS dir, and all of the tests
<BR>
worked fine, then any rpm -b command killed the whole BUILD/BLAS tree,
<BR>
making the build die in the tests.
<BR>
<P>So, I tried to back out, construct an entirely new lapackrpm directory,
<BR>
and re-construct the blas-alpha.tar file.  Then while building the RPM,
<BR>
the patch failed!
<BR>
<P>How can I re-create the blas_patch to reflect my changes in the
<BR>
top-level makefile?  How can I make the RPM?  At least I can copy
<BR>
BUILD/BLAS/libblas.a and .so* to the right places, but then lapack.rpm
<BR>
won't install unless I can build and install the blas rpm!!
<BR>
<P>Finally just added . to my path and built successfully, but but didn't
<BR>
create the .rpm in RPMS!  Oh well.
<BR>
<P>This RPM system seems to make installation negligibly easier (&quot;make&quot; is
<BR>
planty easy for me), but modification extremely difficult.    Since
<BR>
parts of the library aren't LGPL, we can't distribute the RPMs, thus
<BR>
negating much of the motive for making an RPM in the first place.  As a
<BR>
general principle, for something like this under heavy development,
<BR>
might it make more sense to have a source .tar.gz with a makefile and a
<BR>
place to put the non-LGPL part, patch only that part, and distribute the
<BR>
.spec file separately?  It seems this would make modifying and
<BR>
rebuilding far less painful.
<BR>
<P>Sorry to flame, I'm just frustrated after a couple of hours' worth of
<BR>
repeated fix/rebuild attempts.
<BR>
<P>Zeen,
<BR>
