<P>
I know it's offtopic, sorry,
<BR>
but I also know that there is a number of people having quite some knowledge
<BR>
about High Perf. Computing and I guess some of them are physicists like I am.
<BR>
<P><P>I happen to have written yet another numerical library in C++ [Vectors,
<BR>
Matrices, Optimized version of Matrices (Band, Compressed ...), Tensors,
<BR>
lots of solvers, etc.] within the frame of my diploma work. I am thinking
<BR>
that it's done quite well, cause it uses such things as parallelization
<BR>
(pthreads) and the Temporary Base Class Idiom to prevent those nasty
<BR>
redundant Copy Constructors when giving back the results of Operators which
<BR>
normally prevent C++ code to perform well.
<BR>
IMHO, it is worth a publication.
<BR>
<P>Most probably the code of the library will also be made freely available,
<BR>
but the Professor has to give his final statement on it.
<BR>
<P>Of course, there's also an application: We used it to implement our FD
<BR>
algorithm to solve Maxwell's equations in arbitrary coordinates.
<BR>
<P><P>So now my question is: How should this be published? Two articles,
<BR>
one for computer scientists and one for physicists? Or rather one made of
<BR>
two parts: Efficient C++ class design for num. apps and applic. of
<BR>
coordinate trafos to solve FD problems?
<BR>
<P>The related question is: Where to publish?
<BR>
I have no great overview of the journals dealing with such kind of problems.
<BR>
I know that there is the Journ. for Computational Physics. I also found
<BR>
references to Dr. Dobbs for questions about numerical design. (Is the latter
<BR>
an online journal, only, BTW?)
<BR>
I think there are some more journals which might have the audience to read
<BR>
and profit from such an article. Maybe you can tell me ... ?
<BR>
<P>Thanks for your help!
<BR>
<P>Merry X-Mas !

<P> There is  something  frustrating  about  the quality  and  speed  of  Linux
 development.  I.e. the quality  is too high  and the speed  is too high, in
 other words,  I  can implement  this XXXX feature,  but I bet  someone else
 has already done it and is just about to release his patch to Linus soon...
    [From a posting of Tigran Aivazian to linux-kernel, XXXX = disk stat]
