<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;much more detailed 21164 internal info &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; Where did you get that &quot;wisdom&quot; from ?? Is it in the hardware ref.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; manual (that is available in the web) ?? If yes, I must have missed it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, it is spreaded on that manual.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I myself does NOT have any EV5 based machine, then it completely depends
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the hardware ref. manual. (There are 6 MAF, my memory is so volatile!)
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It was almost a year ago (30 Oct 1997) when I introduced the strategy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the Japanese mailing list. And I believe that my strategy is proved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the gemm code.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, thanx.
<BR>
<P>So this is about loads. I will try to find it in the manual, too. How
<BR>
about stores ??  &quot;Scheduling and issuing rules&quot; in the 21164 manual only
<BR>
gives some *static* rules here, for ex. that loads cannot be issued
<BR>
together with stores or on certain cycles relative to other
<BR>
instructions, however, the section on *dynamic* rules simply says:
<BR>
&quot;stores have no result&quot;, hence no latency. This clearly cannot be true
<BR>
in real life. If the memory subsystem is busy, at some point the
<BR>
execution must stop. Clearly, there will be some &quot;write buffers&quot; helping
<BR>
here, but how many ??? Anybody knows that ?? And is there a fast bypass
<BR>
if loads to the same datum follow shortly after the respective store ? I
<BR>
aske because I think to have read about that in the Alpha-Linux FAQ
<BR>
(about the different types of Alpha): As the Alphas &lt; 21264 have no
<BR>
direct fp to integer register move, all those move have to go through
<BR>
memory (You will know that). However, the above FAQ has a note in it
<BR>
that there is/mght be a special bypass to speed up such moves. Maybe it
<BR>
simply the cache coming in here, so you must be able to read back the
<BR>
stored value from write buffer or fast L1 cache, even if L2/L3 or DRAM
<BR>
is still busy and unavailable.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; (Before that I made the prototype patch for cos,sin,exp,pow,...,etc.,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and Mr. Goto coded them with the assembly language. It was useful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for Linux/Alpha community, wasn't it?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanx again
