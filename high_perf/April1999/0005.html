<P>I asked this of the list back in December (12/9), when I saw that libffm
<BR>
symbols had become a subset of those in libffm, and K. Goto replied that
<BR>
libfm can be removed.
<BR>
<P>Thanks Joe!  I don't know how much difference it would make for most apps,
<BR>
but as far as RPM features go, ease of installation of is only the
<BR>
beginning...  We could put up other RPMs on ftp.alphalinux.org that depend on
<BR>
fastmath, such as perhaps spreadsheets- or Mesa, where I imagine faster sqrt,
<BR>
sin and cos would help a lot.  OTOH, CPML is slightly faster, and might be
<BR>
the preferred dependency there.  But then again, vectorized sqrt, sin and cos
<BR>
could make a big difference in Mesa- we'd just have to provide patches to
<BR>
them, and have them added to the official Mesa tree.  [Of course, programs
<BR>
using Mesa would see no advantage unless they link against ffm- and would be
<BR>
required to link against it if Mesa included ffm-specific calls.  Libtool
<BR>
seems to be able to handle this though- see the info page, on inter-library
<BR>
dependencies.]  Does anyone have some free time on their hands to hack Mesa?
<BR>
<P>To fantasize a little further, there could be a standard cross-platform
<BR>
fastmath API whose implementation uses libffm on Alpha, 3D-Now! on AMD,
<BR>
Katmai on newer Intel, and it would be a dependency for a lot of different
<BR>
packages- sort of like the BLAS/LAPACK are a cross-platform matrix API with
<BR>
different implementations on different architectures.  But this type of
<BR>
proposal may exist already, and if not, is just a little bit beyond the scope
<BR>
of this list.
<BR>
<P>For now, since it seems it will work for 21064/21066, we can probably put up
<BR>
a binary fastmath RPM and see what people do with it...
<BR>
<P>One pointer: Joe, are you familiar with the GNU shared library versioning
<BR>
conventions?  If not, it might be worth looking into the libtool info page,
<BR>
in the section on &quot;Versioning&quot;.  The convention is somewhat different from
<BR>
other software, and is important because it clearly indicates changes in
<BR>
library APIs.  For example, although the gnome-libs package is at version
<BR>
1.0.8, libgnome is at 32.3.2, libgnomeui at 32.9.0, libgnorba at 27.1.5, etc.
<BR>
so an older software package can link with the the most recent older library
<BR>
version that has the correct API, or otherwise fail to run if it can't find
<BR>
any with the right API.  That was a convoluted explanation, but I think it
<BR>
might be worth numbering the shared library object using this convention
<BR>
(e.g. libffm.so.4.7.3), even if it differs from the package version number
<BR>
(e.g. 0.30).
<BR>
<P>One last question: how soon can we call you &quot;Dr. Hausmann&quot;? :-)
<BR>
<P>Thanks again,
