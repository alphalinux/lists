<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm currently looking into using a table driven Taylor's series expansion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Hint's and suggestions *very* welcome.  I need to do this over the range
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; from 0 to 100,000,000  w/ the roots off by less than 1

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you reduce that to an interval [0,1) this would mean that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need 10 decimal places.  A decent polynomial approximation plus one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; step of a Newton iteration should bring you in that range, I think.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not necessarily, at least not for high (aka. full 16 digits). There is a
<BR>
reason that there is no polynomial based approximation for sqrt in
<BR>
libffm.
<BR>
<P>First, you want uniform *relative* precision for the function over the
<BR>
full range, so 0..1 won't work. However, you can take acount of the
<BR>
floating point format and only operate on the mantissa and 0.25..1 or
<BR>
0.5..1 using frexp and ldexp (which however, are notoriously ineffective
<BR>
when using the C lib routine, clearly, you NEED assembler here).
<BR>
Unfortunatelly, sqrt is notoriusly ugly in approximating even for small
<BR>
intervalls, you need much higher orders (and large coefficients for the
<BR>
high orders, i.e. bad with respect to numerical stability) compared to
<BR>
say sin(), which is much more well behaved.
<BR>
<P>However, assuming you go for 0.5..1 where you probably need to adjust
<BR>
the result by sqrt(0.5) (further slowdown, you need to test it and
<BR>
decide) and you want 1e-10 final *relative* precision, you need better
<BR>
1e-5 rel. precision before the final Newton step.
<BR>
<P>If anybody wants to give it a try, here are the coefficients for a
<BR>
(nearly) minimax relative prec. polynomial:
<BR>
<P>For better 1e-5 rel. precision from 0.5..1 you already need a 5th order
<BR>
polynomial with the coefficients

however, max. rel. error here is  just above the range, i.e. 1.1e-5
<BR>
<P>Compared to that, for 1e-8 or better 1e-9 initial rel. precision for a
<BR>
full prec. version, you need &gt;= 9th order, slow to evaluate on a machine
<BR>
with pipled floating point unit. You can &quot;vectorize&quot; it by some tricks,
<BR>
that are actually usued in libffm, but you have to further sacrifice
<BR>
some precision for that.
<BR>
<P><P>I would be interested in the result you get, however, I fear, you won't

be able to beat the new libcpml speed !?
