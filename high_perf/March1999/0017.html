<EM>&gt; I would have to revisit my old files; this was quite a while ago.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe this was a rational approximation (it should not not be too costly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on Alpha) but I had in the past pretty decent approximation for a sqrt on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [0,2) interval.  I do not remember max absolute errors, though.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Details are fuzzy now.  You may be right that with one Newton iteration
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one will be still not precise enough in the whole required range.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [0,2) was used as this allowed not to worry about even and odd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exponents.

<P><P>Yes, you are right, rational is known to be MUCH better, but you need
<BR>
pretty SLOW div !!
<BR>
<P>I checked several combinations (with div) considering full range, full
<BR>
*REL* precision and decided it would very likely be slower than the
<BR>
Mosberger sqrt.
<BR>
<P>However, what I suggest for 1e-10 precision (including 1 Newton step)
<BR>
might probably work (mean, be a bit faster, but compared to libcpml ???)
<BR>
<P>And yes we probably could replace the rather small table in the
<BR>
libffm sqrt by another (nonrational) polynomial, but for .25 to 1 we
<BR>
need at least 8th to better 9th order for 1e-5 (here my software is
<BR>
pretty dependable) to be on the sure side after 3 Newton steps, and it
<BR>
will be DEFINITELY slower than the actual version. You see, sqrt is
<BR>
&quot;§$%&amp;/@ as long as you don't go for rational approx.
<BR>
<P>YES, in case cache misses occur, this would be different, but I'm still
<BR>
waiting for the results what the real-world impact on that seems to be.
