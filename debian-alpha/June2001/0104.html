<P>
<EM>&gt; Hi list(s),
</EM><BR>
<P>Also, hi lists. To those reading both. please forgive my &quot;crosspost&quot;.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; It has already slightly appeared in the discussions about Alpha's &quot;dead&quot; is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - the ideologic aspect.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha, especially combined with Linux or *BSD, is for many a symbol of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; freedom and individuality. (not only for youths in puberty struggling to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; escape &quot;the establishment&quot; ;-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are many alternatives to mainstream (intel - PC), like Sun, PPC, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha seems most common to me. It has a high geek-capability (nice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expression, isn't it), because there's much used equipment available.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Relatively little money for a multia takes you to &quot;the Alpha-experience&quot; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for a little more you get a &quot;big&quot; LX-class machine or a miata. Since the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ports of Linux and the free BSDs to Alpha, a large (geek-)community has grown,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which uses Alpha because of its technological superiority, but I'm sure,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also for ideological reasons.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; [... lots of stuff deleted...]
</EM><BR>
<P>When I first had contact with UNIX in university, I wanted to have my own UNIX system
<BR>
ever since then. Running on a low budged ( as most students do ), theobvious way was to
<BR>
get a 286 PC with Xenix on it, which took you quite close to UNIX at the time given. That
<BR>
&quot;solution&quot; did quite cost *a lot*, but allowed you to do all sorts of things, that you could
<BR>
never do with a student's account on the university systems.
<BR>
When I left university, i got my first &quot;UNIX-based&quot; job on the experience earned by learning
<BR>
with my 286PC, which was replaced by 386/486 systems, as they appeared, running Sys VR4
<BR>
at that time.
<BR>
Since I always spend most of my money on computers, I eventually bought a SparcStation 10,
<BR>
which was offered to me at an affordable price in '92. To me, the decision for that system
<BR>
was made on two arguments:
<BR>
1. Geek-factor. The SS10 was a nice desktop-MP and SunOS 4.1.3 was among the best
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unices at it's time ( IMHO, of course ).
<BR>
2. SunOS/SPARC knowledge opened lots of good job-opportunities, so that the &quot;investment&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could pay off.
<BR>
<P>I don't want to bore you with my life, but it did turn out to be a quite reasonable decision.
<BR>
In 96, I got somewhat tired ( and sick ) of SPARC and Solaris and wanted to turn my focus
<BR>
on Linux, of which I still believe today, that having in-depth Linux-knowledge does not
<BR>
only have the obvious high-geek-factor, but also will pay off ( and does already today for me ).
<BR>
<P>At that time, the only decision left, was which platform to choose. PC's were quite fast, but 
<BR>
mostly crap in quality. I bought a PC164 for the same arguments, that I bought the SS10.
<BR>
It was a 64bit-machine, had 64bit Linux on it, had a very high geek-factor and was a 
<BR>
system of excellent design ( IMHO ) compared to what was available.
<BR>
<P>Again, it paid off mostly due to the fact, that the Alpha taught me the subtle pitfalls of
<BR>
porting/developing software for a 64bit platform. I was convinced, that the Alpha platform
<BR>
would succeed, because of obvious technical reasons. At the time, i got my PC164 up
<BR>
and running, I realized, that i had the One And Only True Unix System (TM) in front of
<BR>
me:
<BR>
1. Fast 64bit CPU, excellent FP performance.
<BR>
2. Large memory ( 128Megs was BIG at that time )
<BR>
3. SCSI Bus.
<BR>
4. Complete system software in source
<BR>
5. Excellent Docs ( I'll miss the Digital Techdocs )
<BR>
6. Serial console and a terminal ( were talking geek here ;-)
<BR>
<P>That setup was replaced by a UP2000, a pc with multihead-X being managed by the UP2000
<BR>
and a bunch of other systems, I use for various tasks. I still consider that system to have
<BR>
the ultimate geek-factor from my perspective, but given the announcement of Alphas
<BR>
death, the argument of learning-for-money doesn't quite pay anymore. As a consultant, I
<BR>
heavily influence purchase decisions and get paid for that. Unluckily, from a business 
<BR>
perspective, there no real point anymore for recommending Alpha.
<BR>
<P>In consequence, I will get rid of my Alpha-equipment over the next months and switch over
<BR>
to IA-64. I do not really like it, although I think, IA-64 does have some strong points and
<BR>
some geek-factor. The sad thing is, that I am still *very* pleased with my Alphas ( there are
<BR>
10 sitting in my room ), especially with my UP2000. But I do have to fill my fridge and therefore
<BR>
follow economical constraints.
<BR>
<P>Of course, Compaq did the wrong thing in killing Alpha, and it will come back to them in a
<BR>
few years. Of course, Intel did the *right* thing, because they killed the only architecture
<BR>
with enough performance *and* a roadmap into the future, that really could threaten IA-64.
<BR>
Unluckily, Intel will succeed with IA-64. They won, period.
<BR>
<P>I already managed to get hold of my first linux-based dual Itanium, which I expect to
<BR>
receive in the next months.
<BR>
<P>I can only hope, it has a geek-factor about as high as the Alpha, which would make me
<BR>
anjoy my work as much as i enjoyed it on my Alphas. But one thing is sure:
<BR>
I'll miss the Alpha architecture.....
<BR>
<P>Just my $.02
<BR>
<P>Regards
<BR>
Kirk
