<EM>&gt; &gt; This is a bad situation.  Unless alpha porters start working on

<EM>&gt; &gt; getting things going for their architecture, won't that mean we don't

<EM>&gt; &gt; have boot-floppies and Alpha will not be able to participate in the

<EM>&gt; &gt; Woody release?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Quite the contrary...work is being done on the Alpha boot floppies, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; apparently it wasn't announced.
</EM><BR>
glad to head it :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Ron Farrer and I will be working jointly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on them.  Ron's hit quite a few stumbling blocks (the biggest of which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his low bandwidth problem at home), but I've been mostly unable to even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; start because I don't have a woody chroot or woody system to do the builds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on (I have one alpha...it's running sid and I have no room for a chroot).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
I think most of us are actually build boot floppies in sid for the moment.  The
<BR>
expectation, I believe, is to move to using a frozen base system when that
<BR>
happens, gradually solidifying the environemnt.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Ron put out a query for volunteers to assist and possibly take over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boot-floppies on Alpha totally.  He got quite a few responces, but nobody
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a debian devel yet, so that doesn't help much on the immediate side.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't see how being a debian developer matters.  cvs commit to boot-floppies
<BR>
is not restricted to only Debian developers.  If people start hacking, fixing
<BR>
bugs and sending patches to this list I'm sure Adam would be quick to grant cvs
<BR>
access.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Any ideas on how we can get this done?  Without a chroot, Ron has problems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pulling even a few packages over his modem and I just don't have the room
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for a chroot, leaving lully as our only alternative to work on (which, of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; course, I haven't gotten any responce on).
</EM><BR>
<P>Just use sid, we call them woody boot-floppies since they are going to be used
<BR>
for woody, not because you actually need woody to build them (but don't try
<BR>
building them in potato).
