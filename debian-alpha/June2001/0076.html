<EM>&gt;&gt;Note that it is possible to have one of

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But you could test for any zeroes (maybe by precomputing the 4
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;denominators and checking whether their product is 0?) and then handle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that special case (presumably relatively rare and therefore causing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;little performance penalty) with explicit checks for each denominator.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;With floating-points the checks against 0 should probably involve a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;finite tolerance, to avoid underflows and overflows.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Hmm, that's a good bit of additional code, especially since a good 
<BR>
tolerance will depend on the scale of the mesh, and I don't think with 
<BR>
much benefit (see below).  Also, for the phase field calculations I do, 
<BR>
where there's a lot of action right at the interfaces and zero gradients 
<BR>
everywhere else, this special case is all over the place; though not 
<BR>
everyone is doing phase field. :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;...  It just seems easier
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;to do it this way, and because it's just for graphics, I don't really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;care about the divide by zero.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm not sure what happens to the graphics (might it cause a visual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;artefact at some point?) but someone might try to use the programme's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;output for some further analysis (e.g., volume calculations) rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than just visualization.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
I really don't think so.  The edge intercept is inf (or NaN?), which is 
<BR>
not between zero and one, so no intercept, no triangle intersecting that 
<BR>
edge. I don't think that will have any effect on the resulting 
<BR>
triangulation, or its utility for volume calculations...  I think -mieee 
<BR>
is the way to go.
<BR>
<P>Stefan, regarding trying out PETScGraphics, I recommend &quot;apt-get install 
<BR>
petscgraphics1-demo&quot;, which should drag in all the dependencies 
<BR>
(including rsh-server!), then just run chts, or on an SMP box, &quot;mpirun 
<BR>
-np X /usr/bin/chts&quot;.  Oh- except I haven't uploaded alpha yet (will try 
<BR>
Chris' &quot;$ARCH==alpha*-*-linux-*&quot; test).
<BR>
<P>Thanks all for the feedback.
<BR>
<P>Zeen,
