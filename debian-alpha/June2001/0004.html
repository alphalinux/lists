<EM>&gt; This is a bad situation.  Unless alpha porters start working on

<EM>&gt; getting things going for their architecture, won't that mean we don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have boot-floppies and Alpha will not be able to participate in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Woody release?
</EM><BR>
<P>Quite the contrary...work is being done on the Alpha boot floppies, but
<BR>
apparently it wasn't announced.  Ron Farrer and I will be working jointly
<BR>
on them.  Ron's hit quite a few stumbling blocks (the biggest of which is
<BR>
his low bandwidth problem at home), but I've been mostly unable to even
<BR>
start because I don't have a woody chroot or woody system to do the builds
<BR>
on (I have one alpha...it's running sid and I have no room for a chroot).
<BR>
<P>I wrote to the admin list to see if we could get a woody chroot on lully,
<BR>
but I haven't heard a responce on this at all yet (over two weeks
<BR>
now...and my message also stated that lully needed a kernel change due to
<BR>
random lockups).
<BR>
<P>Ron put out a query for volunteers to assist and possibly take over
<BR>
boot-floppies on Alpha totally.  He got quite a few responces, but nobody
<BR>
is a debian devel yet, so that doesn't help much on the immediate side.
<BR>
<P>Any ideas on how we can get this done?  Without a chroot, Ron has problems
<BR>
pulling even a few packages over his modem and I just don't have the room
<BR>
for a chroot, leaving lully as our only alternative to work on (which, of
<BR>
course, I haven't gotten any responce on).
