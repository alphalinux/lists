Hello,
<BR>
<P>I have for a long time been trying to get my CD-R 
<BR>
to work under Linux, It's a Phillips CDD2600 connected
<BR>
to an AdvanSys ISA controller. I have compiled in
<BR>
SCSI support as modules in the kernel. That is to
<BR>
say; SCSI support, generic SCSI support,
<BR>
SCSI CD-ROM support and the AdvanSys low
<BR>
level driver.
<BR>
<P>All modules seems to load just fine when I use
<BR>
insmod on them, but if I try an rmmod, it says that
<BR>
they are not loaded.
<BR>
<P>At some point in the past, on an older RedHat
<BR>
system, I was able to get one step furter. xcdroast
<BR>
(isn't that the name?) actually found a SCSI device,
<BR>
but was unable to use it.
<BR>
<P>My first step would be to be able to mount the CD-R
<BR>
as a CD-ROM. I've tried to mount it using /dev/sg*,
<BR>
but it complains that that's not a block device (which
<BR>
is true, at least on my system). I've also tried /dev/scd*,
<BR>
but it then comlains about wrong major and minor
<BR>
numbers.
<BR>
<P>Also note: on the older system mentioned, 
<BR>
cdrecord -scanbus yielded some  garbagge
<BR>
indicating that there was something there, but it
<BR>
didn't know what. Now, the same command yields
<BR>
nothing.
<BR>
<P>Any help here would be greatly appreciated.
<BR>
<P>BTW: I'm running Potato on an Alpha with kernel
<BR>
2.4.5. The older RedHat system mentioned was
<BR>
RedHat 5.2/6.0 running a 2.2.x kernel (don't
<BR>
remember exactly which one).
<BR>
