Hi list(s),
<BR>
<P>It has already slightly appeared in the discussions about Alpha's &quot;dead&quot; is
<BR>
- the ideologic aspect.
<BR>
Alpha, especially combined with Linux or *BSD, is for many a symbol of
<BR>
freedom and individuality. (not only for youths in puberty struggling to
<BR>
escape &quot;the establishment&quot; ;-)
<BR>
<P>There are many alternatives to mainstream (intel - PC), like Sun, PPC, but
<BR>
Alpha seems most common to me. It has a high geek-capability (nice
<BR>
expression, isn't it), because there's much used equipment available.
<BR>
Relatively little money for a multia takes you to &quot;the Alpha-experience&quot; and
<BR>
for a little more you get a &quot;big&quot; LX-class machine or a miata. Since the
<BR>
ports of Linux and the free BSDs to Alpha, a large (geek-)community has grown,
<BR>
which uses Alpha because of its technological superiority, but I'm sure,
<BR>
also for ideological reasons.
<BR>
<P>Such a community in the &quot;low-end&quot; gives strong support to a platform. It
<BR>
provides a large user-base and, concerning Open Source, a huge development
<BR>
potential. AlphaLinux has greatly improved in recent years (p.e.
<BR>
OpenGL-acceleration in XFree 4.0) by contributions from Compaq (ccc) or
<BR>
API, but mainly because enthusiastic users tested these improvements and,
<BR>
last but in no way least, improved AlphaLinux by themselves.
<BR>
<P>Compaq won't have to create an enthusiastic license for the
<BR>
Itanium-versions of Tru64 and VMS in near future, because no &quot;enthusiastic&quot;
<BR>
will be able to afford such a computer. Of course Intel can slap Itaniums
<BR>
in the faces of strategically important persons (Linus Torvalds, Alan Cox
<BR>
...), how they already did in the past - an Alpha was slammed into Linus
<BR>
Torvald's -- garage.
<BR>
And even if you could afford one, which freedom-aware &quot;geek&quot; (and
<BR>
OpenSource-businessmen) can justify to his conscience to purchase an
<BR>
Itanium after the recent happenings ??
<BR>
<P>Of course, Intel can pay engineers to improve the IA-64 port of Linux, but
<BR>
the real spirit of free software only lives through a broad user community.
<BR>
<P>I hope I was able to (linguistically) express my thoughts,
<BR>
<P>Greetings,
<BR>
Marius Hillenbrand
