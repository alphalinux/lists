<P>
Since your last e-mail, I updated my firmware to 5.5-1, which according the 
<BR>
Compaq site is the latest to dare go with this older hardware.  It made no 
<BR>
difference in the outcome.  The de4x5 driver lasts longer than the tulip 
<BR>
which makes sense because that is what it is (de-500-aa).

<EM>&gt; ewa0_mode twist forces the driver to use 10mb half duplex.

<EM>&gt; ewa0_mode fast forces the driver to 100mb half duplex
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ewa0_mode fastfd forces 100mb full duplex
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ewa0_mode auto allows the driver to ask the switch what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they can do together. Hubs are 10 or 100mb half duplex.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lucent P550 (big $$$) does auto right, and it works.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lucent P120 usually does auto right.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most cisco boxes DO NOT do auto right.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the HP pro-curve switches do auto right.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok.  Now I see what you mean.  No, I can't change the router box and my 
<BR>
building is limited to 10 Mb/s.  We are in the process of upgrading some of 
<BR>
our site to 100 Mb/s and I will get there eventually.  So it seems like 
<BR>
ewa0_mode twisted-pair must be correct for my case since de4x5 will not do 
<BR>
full duplex anyway.   I have better networking at home than this place!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I agree that there is a problem with the tulip driver
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in tulip mode. the de4x5 driver will not do full duplex,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but it doesn't lock the machine up doing a re-init
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on &quot;carrier error&quot;. The 2.4.0 kernel used the &quot;old&quot; tulip driver
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and worked. 2.4.1 - and later use the new driver, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't 100%.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	I use the de4x5 and ewa0_mode auto. So what if its half
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; duplex. On a switch that doesn't really matter much.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; With srm 5.8-1 you can drop in an ee-pro-100B (intel) card,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its called a DE600-aa :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I hate intel cards, they do not autonegotiate at all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Usually you have to force them and the switch to use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the duplex you want.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you have access to the switch, try the de4x5 driver,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and set ewa0_mode to fastfd, set the switch to 100 full,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no autonegotiate.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is all good information to know when we do get the 100 Mb/s.
<BR>
In the mean time, my card is suspect since some errors did show up.  I wonder 
<BR>
of 2.4.x enhances this and causes the errors to show up prior?
<BR>
<P>Is there another card you might recommend that would work better and be 
<BR>
compatible with the 5.5-1 SRM?  Maybe I could give Microway a call and see 
<BR>
what they have now for the newer kernels.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	I dual boot redhat 7.0 and tru64 T5.1A-4 (field test site)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on one of my XP1000's. I have a up2000 2gb 833mhz dual cpu...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wow - what a screamer!
</EM><BR>
<P>ORNL has a Compaq supercomputer, but I think they are running tru64 on it 
<BR>
also.  I could not see an advantage for a single system running numerically 
<BR>
intensive code.  If you have Compaq's compilers for Linux, you get the same 
<BR>
throughput.  Now, if you need to parallel, then the better I/O might make it 
<BR>
worth it.  Personally, I would like a Microway Beowulf system with lot's of 
<BR>
processort running Linux for about $50K.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	If you suspect the card is bad, try booting tru64
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and watch a &quot;ping -f&quot;... any more than a few lost packets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; says things are BAD.
</EM><BR>
<P>Don't boot Tru64 anymore (gone!).  I'm running Debian/Linux exclusively now.  
<BR>
I'll try this under LInux.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No, you don't need another card, just use 100 half and de4x5.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; post to the developer listed in the linux source tree
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I'll do the same.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe I can use this to justify the expense of getting to 100 Mb/s for our 
<BR>
building!
