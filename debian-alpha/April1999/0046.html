<P>
...because there's no one I can yell at when I don't get an
<BR>
answer. :-)
<BR>
<P>I asked a question on debian-alpha a few days ago about trying to
<BR>
install Debian 2.1 from CD onto my Jensen.
<BR>
<P>To recap, I got everything going up to the SRM prompt, but when I
<BR>
tried to boot from a floppy I got the cryptic error message &quot;84 FAIL&quot;.
<BR>
I did manage to get aboot to start from my CD-ROM drive, but when I
<BR>
tried to give it the location of the kernel (&quot;/boot/jensen/linux&quot;), it
<BR>
gave a funny message about an unexpected object format.
<BR>
<P>Anyways, I'm pretty much STUCK right now.  I've tried re-re-installing
<BR>
the 1.7 firmware and I've run the EISA Config Utility more times than
<BR>
I want to think about, and I still get the same damn messages.
<BR>
<P>Since my previous question didn't stir anybody's interest, here's
<BR>
another one: is it possible to find some documentation on this SRM
<BR>
thingy on the Web?  I've never seen anything like it before -- the
<BR>
commands and error messages are 100% foreign and incomprehensible.
<BR>
<P>Maybe if I understood SRM a little better, I could take better aim at
<BR>
troubleshooting this problem.
