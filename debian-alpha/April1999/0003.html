<P>I've been loosely following that thread on axplist also.  My take on the
<BR>
whole thing is: Why?  Granted, running NT-Alpha binaries would be good,
<BR>
running NT-i386 binaries would not necessarily turn in the performance
<BR>
expected for several reasons (which they've no doubt covered over there).
<BR>
In short, the overhead of em86 having to handle all machine-level
<BR>
corrections on something as complex as Wine would put such a hit on the
<BR>
processor that you could more easily scrape together a 486 to turn in
<BR>
better performance.
<BR>
<P>I'll keep a closer eyeball on that thread from now on, though, to see if
<BR>
anyone comes up with some ideas as to how to counter the poor performance
<BR>
argument (ie. if someone decides to port Wine to Alpha to emulate
<BR>
NT-Alpha).
