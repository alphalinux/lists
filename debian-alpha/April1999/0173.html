<P><EM>&gt; I upgraded a fairly fresh install of Slink to Potato (of about 16 hours
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ago). Since then the system has gone mad (seemingly random dates within
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1970 are reported). I don't think this is a problem with the date command
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as pppd also reports negative times and generally fails to work. I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using the 2.0.36 jensen kernel from the CD.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what I went through for about a week. I compiled a 2.2.3
<BR>
minimal kernel, no modules and the systems date was screwed up, I got
<BR>
multiple segfaults from the init scripts and eventually the system would
<BR>
hang. Trying to upgrade packages led to everything dying because of the
<BR>
lchown function call which apparently only correctly works in 2.2. Thanks
<BR>
to Bart's help, I was able to force install of certain packages such as
<BR>
apt, bash and a few others, but the system time was always screwed up
<BR>
under the newly installed libs. Out of experimenting, I tried booting the
<BR>
2.2.3 kernel I had compiled under 2.0.35 and the system came up cleanly!
<BR>
Installing the rest of the potato debs was a snap, except for the modem
<BR>
downloads :).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Moving to a 2.2.6 kernel seems to fix the date problems but due to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; multiple oopses 2.2.6 is unusable. In fact, I'll only use it to get a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; working PPP when I need to download some more .debs.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two days ago compiled 2.2.6, and everything worked. Where
<BR>
do you see the oopses happening? Right now the only issue I have is with
<BR>
Plug and Pray in the kernel. It is really sparsely documented, and my
<BR>
soundcard still needs isapnptools to configure. But after the despair I
<BR>
had in upgrading I am very happy right now. The transition from 1.2 to 2.0
<BR>
was about as painful, but at least I could install from scratch. Not an
<BR>
option with debian-alpha yet since there aren't any bootdisks out yet. But
<BR>
that's just one of the dangers of living on the edge.
<BR>
<P>Greetings,
<BR>
Michael.
