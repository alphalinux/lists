<P>
My UDB miata has been running as a backup server for some time with
<BR>
redhat.  When one of the hard drives finally gave out yesterday I
<BR>
figured I might as well convert to debian.
<BR>
<P>1) milo booted fine on resc144 but &quot;Not enough memory to ...&quot;
<BR>
or some such.  It's low end, yes, with 24MB.  Is that enough?
<BR>
<P>2) So I took the new SCSI and put it on an i86 box, created the
<BR>
file system, untarred base2_1 and modified fstab, uninstalled.sh,
<BR>
and a few other files.  Plugged it back into the miata and booted
<BR>
it up with my old redhat milo and kernel 2.1.54.  
<BR>
<P>Config like this:
<BR>
/dev/sda2 /boot  (has 2.1.54 kernel)
<BR>
/dev/sdb1 /      (the new file system base2_1 on new SCSI)
<BR>
/dev/sda4 unmounted, but has the old filesystem
<BR>
<P>It comes up and works with networking if I boot single.  It passes
<BR>
fsck.
<BR>
<P>In single user mode I'm unable to chown a file.  For example
<BR>
apt-get dies with:
<BR>
&lt;sc 208(1202edb0,0,0)&gt;tar: Cannot chown to uid 0 gid 0: Operation not permitted
<BR>
<P>Operation not permitted if I just try to chown a file from
<BR>
command line.
<BR>
<P>In multi user mode I can't log in; unable to change /dev/tty{?}.
<BR>
<P>The / is rw; I can modify files and save them. The few permissions
<BR>
I checked in /dev seem to match my i86 machines.  (MAKEDEV won't 
<BR>
because of the chown thing.)
<BR>
<P>Question is:
<BR>
Can anyone tell me what is happening here?  I've got a read write
<BR>
disk but can't chown and can't &quot;change /dev/tty&quot;. There is no dev/pts
<BR>
but 2.1.54 doesn't know about them...hmmmm... maybe login **needs**
<BR>
them now?  Is this a kernel issue ( 2.1.54 was an &quot;early glibc&quot; 
<BR>
kernel)?  Is it a disk issue with my setting it up on i86 
<BR>
(is e2fs e2fs everywhere)?
<BR>
<P>Is it an over-optimistic installation prcess ;^) ?
<BR>
