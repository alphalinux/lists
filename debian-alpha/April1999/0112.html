<P>In C++, you can &quot;overload&quot; a function, meaning that you can actually make
<BR>
two functions with the same name providing that they accept different
<BR>
arguments (for example: test(int x) and test(long x) can both exist in the
<BR>
same code and each will work depending on what type of argument is passed
<BR>
to test's 'x' var.  It's actually a really neat concept and VERY handy
<BR>
(wish we had it in C, actually).
<BR>
<P>Anyway, what's going on above is that the function RuntExists is calling
<BR>
IsRunt with an argument of the type ViceVersionVector.  Well, the same
<BR>
source code file (at line 707) defines an IsRunt() function that accepts
<BR>
ViceVersionVector arguments, and I believe was meant to overload the
<BR>
default IsRunt() function which presumably wouldn't accept arguments of
<BR>
that type before.  The problem is, according to inconsist.h on line 83,
<BR>
there is another definition of the function IsRunt() that accepts
<BR>
arguments of type vv_t.
<BR>
<P>Now you may think that ViceVersionVector != vv_t, and that wouldn't be a
<BR>
bad assumption (I wouldn't normally think they were the same either), but
<BR>
thinking about some programmers' naming conventions lead me to believe
<BR>
that the name 'vv_t' actually means &quot;version vector type&quot; or &quot;vice
<BR>
version type&quot; (I'd pick the former).  If that's true, they you can
<BR>
probably find a line somewhere in the source that defines type vv_t as
<BR>
being equal to ViceVersionVector (or vice versa), which would break
<BR>
overloading there since both functions would be called in the same
<BR>
instances (or they could even both be defined as ints, which might also
<BR>
cause overloading problems on some compilers...dunno about ANSI C++ right
<BR>
now..no books here).
<BR>
<P>In short (too late, right :-), look for what ViceVersionVector and vv_t
<BR>
actually represent and see if the types are identical.  If so, then figure
<BR>
out which one will do what it should be doing properly and find a way to
<BR>
use that one exclusively and make the other one invisible at compile time
<BR>
(basically try to use one or the other).
<BR>
<P>Let me know how it goes...and hope that long explanation helped...
