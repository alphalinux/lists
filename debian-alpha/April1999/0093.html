<EM>&gt; How old is it?  If it's what I think it is, it's an Amdahl/Fujitsu
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; teamserver, which should be NT-based (meaning, it's more likely a Pentium
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or compat running NT).  From what info I can find currently, they are all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Intel based and should be based on existing (known) equipment.  Be aware
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that Fujitsu also makes Sparc equipment, so this may be some ancient Sun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clone.  In that case, it may have a processor on a card in the system (not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the motherboard).  In that case, I'm unsure as to whether or not it'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; run Linux or not.  Best thing to do is to ask whomever was going to sell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it to you which OS they were running on it.  Since I don't think NT ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ran on Sparcs (well, ok, it did, but nobody marketed them that I know of),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that may be the best clue.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As to whether or not to buy it...hmmm...it's up to you.  Depends on how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much hassle you may want to deal with if things aren't exactly compatible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with current kernels.  It looks ok, but who knows with legacy hardware.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; At any rate, it's not an Alpha at least.  In fact, the only other company
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; besides DEC/Compaq that I know of to make ANY Alpha product like that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be Samsung, who's just been licensed for m/b and chip products
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyway.

<P>The store thats selling havent got a clue what it is, just some server
<BR>
they got when they upgraded some local buissness.
<BR>
They also got a 12 CPU Pentium (66MHz) server which they sold for the same
<BR>
price ($3-400), sadly I missed it by a day.
<BR>
<P>And about the ROSS system, the only external card on it was a SCSI
<BR>
controller, so I wont buy (well perhaps if I get it for $100 :)).
<BR>
Thanks all
