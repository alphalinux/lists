<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; regular discussion was just using em86 and a Wine compiled on i386.  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that assumption was wrong, then, yes, we would save ALOT of steps, but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still think Win API calls will be kinda creepy.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you dont't emulate the api calls, why bother with wine? The native
<BR>
windows runs just as fast or faster and is much more complete. Just
<BR>
use bochs. I don't quite see the point in using wine if its not native.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Also, another thought keeps popping up in my head.  The absolute best idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be to somehow have Wine and em86 merged code-wise to allow em86
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; handle i386 calls and Wine handle just emulating Windows and Win API
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; calls (even those from Alpha binaries...assuming the supporting libs are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ok).  I'm thinking that this kind of merge would allow us to run 386 and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha Win binaries under the same Wine setup (just conjecture...alot of
</EM><BR>
<P>Why? em86-wine would be dynamically linked against wine-lib-alpha and
<BR>
alpha wine binaries also. alpha binaries would not start the emulator, 
<BR>
but just link against the lib and i386 win bins would start the
<BR>
emulator.
<BR>
Isn't it that way its already on intel?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; work would need to be done...mostly by Compaq since only they have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; source to em86 from what I recall).  That would be the ideal setup
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allowing us to run some things native if possible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Since we have the source fo wine and its lib, what we now need is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; emulator that maps the i386 win api calls to a native alpha wine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; lib. Thats the point where an emulator should become useable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So we would have to incorporate em86 somehow into the backend of Wine so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that specific i386 calls are emulated by it, but API calls are handled by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the lib....correct?  I think I'm understanding this idea better now :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, thats it. It might be better to use bochs or freemware instead of 
<BR>
em86, because of its license.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Another thing we would have to ensure is, if we (or someone) decide to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implement this, that the API calls are properly implemented based on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arch's headers.  I'm not sure if i386 Windows NT and Alpha NT have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same header files (meaning that the functions are called with arguments of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the same types across platforms), but if they do, then running Alpha NT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; binaries would be ALOT easier and not a whole lot of work would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; required on Wine to accomplish this (well, at least compared to getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; i386 stuff to work).
</EM><BR>
<P>Otherwise we need an wine-i386 and wine-alpha for alpha. But I don't
<BR>
think thats a big problem. How many alpha-NT programs are out there
<BR>
that one wants to use?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Yes, such a switch is pretty handy, but those are quite expensive and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the cheaper once have poor quality. Its easier to use remote displays
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with X and telnets.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Agreed.  Too bad I haven't found a really good X server for most of my Win
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equipment yet :-(
</EM><BR>
<P>May the Source be with you.
