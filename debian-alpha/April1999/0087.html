<EM>&gt; scsi-controller , printed on the controller was the word SUN, that got me

<EM>&gt; Should I buy the thing?

<P>How old is it?  If it's what I think it is, it's an Amdahl/Fujitsu
<BR>
teamserver, which should be NT-based (meaning, it's more likely a Pentium
<BR>
or compat running NT).  From what info I can find currently, they are all
<BR>
Intel based and should be based on existing (known) equipment.  Be aware
<BR>
that Fujitsu also makes Sparc equipment, so this may be some ancient Sun
<BR>
clone.  In that case, it may have a processor on a card in the system (not
<BR>
on the motherboard).  In that case, I'm unsure as to whether or not it'll
<BR>
run Linux or not.  Best thing to do is to ask whomever was going to sell
<BR>
it to you which OS they were running on it.  Since I don't think NT ever
<BR>
ran on Sparcs (well, ok, it did, but nobody marketed them that I know of),
<BR>
that may be the best clue.
<BR>
<P>As to whether or not to buy it...hmmm...it's up to you.  Depends on how
<BR>
much hassle you may want to deal with if things aren't exactly compatible
<BR>
with current kernels.  It looks ok, but who knows with legacy hardware.
<BR>
<P>At any rate, it's not an Alpha at least.  In fact, the only other company
<BR>
besides DEC/Compaq that I know of to make ANY Alpha product like that
<BR>
would be Samsung, who's just been licensed for m/b and chip products
<BR>
anyway.
