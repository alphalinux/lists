<P>
I responded yesterday, but my email system was all screwed up so I guess
<BR>
it didn't get through :(.  It took me 2 weeks to get the jensen to finally
<BR>
take debian.  First of all, the jensen SRM console can't access the floppy
<BR>
so you have to boot into the nt side and run copyboot.exe from a floppy
<BR>
to copy a floppy image to the hard disk.  For some reason &lt;at least with
<BR>
my jensen&gt; aboot wont boot linux if it has tried to boot a kernel that
<BR>
dosnt exist.  What i ended up doing is compiling the aboot utils for i386
<BR>
&lt;don't have any other alphas&gt; and created my own boot disk to write to the
<BR>
HD to boot off of.  you sould read the Jensen-HOWTO, it is at ftp.dec.com.
<BR>
If you would like a copy of my custom 'boot disk' ill send it to you.
<BR>
Just rember that a jensen is quite a challange to install to.
<BR>
<P>Please CC any relevant comments to me as well as the list.
