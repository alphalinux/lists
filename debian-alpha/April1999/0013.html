<P>To use libcpml.a, you probably should include cpml.h because it maps the
<BR>
appropriate calls to the fast calls in libcpml.a.  I'm also evaluating
<BR>
this lib, but under a potato system.

<EM>&gt; the link will cause a problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The linker claims that there is no __atan2 entry.
</EM><BR>
<P>There isn't such an animal in libcpml.a, fyi.  That would explain the
<BR>
missing entry, at least not in my &quot;findings&quot; so far.  Read on...

<EM>&gt; Does anyone know why this definition is here only for __OPTIMIZE__?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  From what I can gather (on my slink system at least, not true under
<BR>
glibc 2.1), the __OPTIMIZE__ is telling libm to include it's
<BR>
machine-dependent inline functions rather than the standard algorythms
<BR>
that are compiled on every machine.  It's assumed that the inlines are
<BR>
faster than the standard since the inlines are often written specifically
<BR>
for the target machine arch.  It's only included when __OPTIMIZE__ is used
<BR>
since it's usually also assumed that you would want speed improvements if
<BR>
you chose to optimise, thus, it goes for what it considers to be the
<BR>
fastest routines for atan2, in this case, the inlines.  If you look
<BR>
elsewhere in __math.h for fabs() and copysign() defs, you'll notice that
<BR>
those are all inline functions.  __atan2() isn't really, but it is an
<BR>
Alpha-optimised version of atan2() (poorly optimised in comparison to
<BR>
glibc 2.1's, but still better than the standard algorythm). 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think it does not help much even with libm or libffm. And I want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to remove the definition. For my machine I will remove it immediately.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wouldn't do that unless you intend on using libffm or libcpml
<BR>
exclusively (or just want the plain ol' routines in libm without the
<BR>
inlines).  You may be better off to just remove or comment out the
<BR>
__atan2() def from __math.h since you may want to keep the inlines for
<BR>
fabs() and copysign().  That will keep atan2() from being mapped to
<BR>
__atan2() and will subsequently work with libffm or libcpml using &lt;math.h&gt;
<BR>
<P>My pleasure.
<BR>
<P>What are you using for benchmarks when evaluating libcpml?  I am using
<BR>
clinpack, which is less than optimal, but it works.  I can send results if
<BR>
needed.
