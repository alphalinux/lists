<P><EM>&gt; Can anyone identify with this? What is the error telling me?  Should I be

</EM><BR>
<P>Well, it's not an &quot;error&quot; per se, but rather a warning that some part of
<BR>
the programme or lib that it uses is manipulating &quot;unaligned&quot; data or
<BR>
structures, meaning that they are not aligned on the boundaries that the
<BR>
Alpha processor expects. These warnings can be disabled at the kernel
<BR>
level (modify a small chunk of the kernel...patch is on the axp-list
<BR>
archives somewhere).
<BR>
<P>Now, as to whether or not to be concerned about it...that depends on how
<BR>
good you are at coding and/or gdb.  If you're programming skills are at
<BR>
the &quot;novice&quot; level, it may not be something you want to tackle.  After
<BR>
all, the software DOES work and the performance tradeoff is frequently not
<BR>
THAT bad (the kernel corrects for such unaligned accesses, fyi).  If
<BR>
you're good, however, dig in there with gdb and find out just what is at
<BR>
the address that it's giving you in the warning message.  That should tell
<BR>
you that, somewhere there's either a type mismatch or some type of poor
<BR>
typecasting done on that function/structure/variable.

<P>IMO, the daemon runs and works, so unless you use the console alot and/or
<BR>
really care if it gets debugged totally, don't mess with it.  If you
<BR>
manage to get everything debugged, however, please notify the upstream
<BR>
authors with a patch so that they can fix it there for all of us to enjoy.
<BR>
Most of the people who write these packages are usually writing on
<BR>
i386-class Linux machines and don't think about 64-bit archs.  They
<BR>
usually appreciate the extra work since they rarely have access to such
<BR>
archs.
