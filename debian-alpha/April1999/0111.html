<P>Hehehehe...sorry :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Why so many steps? Only the nativ program code should be emulated as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; i386 code and be real slow. As soon as a win api call is detected, the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wine should be able to switch to native alpha code and run it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; FAAAST. So after step 1. above, you would have some X calls and be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; done with.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is assuming we have a Wine lib that works on Alphas.  I assumed the
<BR>
regular discussion was just using em86 and a Wine compiled on i386.  If
<BR>
that assumption was wrong, then, yes, we would save ALOT of steps, but I
<BR>
still think Win API calls will be kinda creepy.
<BR>
<P>Also, another thought keeps popping up in my head.  The absolute best idea
<BR>
would be to somehow have Wine and em86 merged code-wise to allow em86
<BR>
handle i386 calls and Wine handle just emulating Windows and Win API
<BR>
calls (even those from Alpha binaries...assuming the supporting libs are
<BR>
ok).  I'm thinking that this kind of merge would allow us to run 386 and
<BR>
Alpha Win binaries under the same Wine setup (just conjecture...alot of
<BR>
work would need to be done...mostly by Compaq since only they have the
<BR>
source to em86 from what I recall).  That would be the ideal setup
<BR>
allowing us to run some things native if possible.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Since we have the source fo wine and its lib, what we now need is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; emulator that maps the i386 win api calls to a native alpha wine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lib. Thats the point where an emulator should become useable.
</EM><BR>
<P>So we would have to incorporate em86 somehow into the backend of Wine so
<BR>
that specific i386 calls are emulated by it, but API calls are handled by
<BR>
the lib....correct?  I think I'm understanding this idea better now :-)
<BR>
<P>Another thing we would have to ensure is, if we (or someone) decide to
<BR>
implement this, that the API calls are properly implemented based on the
<BR>
arch's headers.  I'm not sure if i386 Windows NT and Alpha NT have the
<BR>
same header files (meaning that the functions are called with arguments of
<BR>
the same types across platforms), but if they do, then running Alpha NT
<BR>
binaries would be ALOT easier and not a whole lot of work would be
<BR>
required on Wine to accomplish this (well, at least compared to getting
<BR>
i386 stuff to work).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yes, such a switch is pretty handy, but those are quite expensive and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the cheaper once have poor quality. Its easier to use remote displays
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with X and telnets.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed.  Too bad I haven't found a really good X server for most of my Win
<BR>
equipment yet :-(
