Just my 2c worth,
<BR>
<P>Why bother with wine and em86 when NT is available for Alpha? Is there some
<BR>
special reason (like wine is able to read linux filesystems?)
<BR>
<P>btw:  I am trying to peice together a 21064a motherboard to dual boot
<BR>
NT/Linux ... anyone know what systems with these were called?  I think the
<BR>
correct images to use are &quot;Cabriolet&quot;
<BR>
<P>Rob

<P><EM>&gt;&gt;It recently came up on another list that I'm a member of so I thought I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;would aske the masters.  Will it be difficult to run wine on an alpha?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;(when wine gets more stable in general)  Will it be difficult to port to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; run with debian's current set of libraries?   Thanks for your replies.  
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I've been loosely following that thread on axplist also.  My take on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whole thing is: Why?  Granted, running NT-Alpha binaries would be good,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;running NT-i386 binaries would not necessarily turn in the performance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expected for several reasons (which they've no doubt covered over there).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In short, the overhead of em86 having to handle all machine-level
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;corrections on something as complex as Wine would put such a hit on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;processor that you could more easily scrape together a 486 to turn in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;better performance.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'll keep a closer eyeball on that thread from now on, though, to see if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anyone comes up with some ideas as to how to counter the poor performance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;argument (ie. if someone decides to port Wine to Alpha to emulate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;NT-Alpha).
