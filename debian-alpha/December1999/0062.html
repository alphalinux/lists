<P><EM>&gt; Why alpha arch? If relating only to network/internet server use is there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any real advantage to alphas? My understanding (I am not an engineer) is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that alphas are better number crunchers. But net IO is so slow that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; multiple nics in a P3 seems to be adaquate for &quot;normal&quot; organizations. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Except for people like that guy who used 120 alphas to do the rendering
<BR>
for the movie Titanic, I doubt one linperson in who have alphas actually
<BR>
really needs it.  I think most people have them because they are truly
<BR>
superior machines and a nice alternative to wintel, not because they need
<BR>
the horsepower.  There are problems, however...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What is a good non-archaic alpha to start with? My only alpha experiance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is with AS100a and DUnix4.0d. This would be a debian only, experimental,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; learn why I want to envest in alpha box. I don't want to be bleeding edge,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but something made in the last generation or so would be nice. Also what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be a good comparison to a P3 500, 256MB RAM, 10GB hd. Aprox price?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure.  I have an alpha xlt that I havn't ever been able to get to
<BR>
run right (kernel unaligned traps in 1.3, debian install problems with
<BR>
debian 2.1).  The sad truth is that alphas aren't (or weren't) really
<BR>
compatible with each other as far as bootstrapping is concerned, so an
<BR>
already small user base is further fragmented.  It seems to me that what
<BR>
really needs to happen to make alternate platform linuxs work is for the
<BR>
companies that have an interest in the particular platforms to step in and
<BR>
do some work to support them.  digital made a reasonable effort, from what
<BR>
I understand compaq has lately more-or-less dumped the line.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now just one &quot;complaint&quot; from a non-alpha guy who is interested in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arch. Why is information so hard to find? What info I was able to find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seems to be at such a high level that it is almost not understandable by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those of us who are fairly clueless. I sm not a genius but I am not an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idiot either. 
</EM><BR>
<P>The above observation applies to bootstapping documentation as well.  IIRC
<BR>
there are in the actual disks directories (ex. /xlt) documents which tell
<BR>
you how to get started.  They contain some errors though, like mixed up /
<BR>
\ and the like.
