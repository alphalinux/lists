Ok I have been lurking for awhile and thought that I would ask the above
<BR>
questions. I am not trying to start a war, I just can't seem to find &quot;real
<BR>
and practical&quot; answers. So I go to those who actually use alphas for real
<BR>
answers. Also keep in mind that I am asking these as a i386 debian user
<BR>
who is unwilling to consider other OS as an answer. (Homogenious OS
<BR>
environment is a nice concept)
<BR>
<P>Why alpha arch? If relating only to network/internet server use is there
<BR>
any real advantage to alphas? My understanding (I am not an engineer) is
<BR>
that alphas are better number crunchers. But net IO is so slow that
<BR>
multiple nics in a P3 seems to be adaquate for &quot;normal&quot; organizations. 
<BR>
<P>If this is true would an alpha serve beter as a cross platform conpiler
<BR>
for an i386 network as opposed to a net server? Example would be each
<BR>
i386 machine needing custom kernels that would be compiled on a regular
<BR>
basis. 
<BR>
<P>What is a good non-archaic alpha to start with? My only alpha experiance
<BR>
is with AS100a and DUnix4.0d. This would be a debian only, experimental,
<BR>
learn why I want to envest in alpha box. I don't want to be bleeding edge,
<BR>
but something made in the last generation or so would be nice. Also what
<BR>
would be a good comparison to a P3 500, 256MB RAM, 10GB hd. Aprox price?
<BR>
<P>Lastly, where to look for reputable dealers? If there are any here please
<BR>
speak up :) Are there any evaluation programs available via vendors, etc.  
<BR>
<P>&lt;rant!&gt;
<BR>
<P>Now just one &quot;complaint&quot; from a non-alpha guy who is interested in the
<BR>
arch. Why is information so hard to find? What info I was able to find
<BR>
seems to be at such a high level that it is almost not understandable by
<BR>
those of us who are fairly clueless. I sm not a genius but I am not an
<BR>
idiot either. 
<BR>
<P>&lt;/rant!&gt;
<BR>
<P>Had to get that out. 
<BR>
<P>TIA for help/info
