<EM>&gt; Why is it important?
</EM><BR>
<P>Because this can upset many things (besides dpkg which doesn't like it

and doesn't allow for a smooth upgrade) like intrusion detection et al.

<EM>&gt; &gt; It looks like one alpha autobuilder is producing packages with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; timestamps in the future. The system time on that machine should 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be corrected.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This has already been acknowledged by Chris C. Chimelis (whose machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was the culprit).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In time the packages will be become &quot;up to date&quot; again (in about 10 days
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I guess :-), so I think it's safe to close this bug.
</EM><BR>
<P>Jup.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; BTW, it's probably better to simply report this to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; debian-alpha@lists.debian.org ...
</EM><BR>
<P>I had it also on debian-devel IIRC.
<BR>
<P>I've not been tracking the autobuilder systems for a very long
<BR>
time now, so I just assigned it to general from where I was sure
<BR>
it would be picked up and forwarded to the correct person.
<BR>
<P>Utilizing the bug-tracking system was maybe not the most efficient 
<BR>
way to get the problem fixed, but for sure it is a reliable one.
