<P>
<EM>&gt; Except for people like that guy who used 120 alphas to do the rendering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the movie Titanic, I doubt one linperson in who have alphas actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really needs it.  I think most people have them because they are truly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; superior machines and a nice alternative to wintel, not because they need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the horsepower.  There are problems, however...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, in my lab there's a lot of people who run number crunching jobs 
<BR>
that can typically last several days ( me included ). I've just ordered a 
<BR>
new Alpha ( dual CPU DS20 ). For the same price I could have bought several
<BR>
P3s or lower range Alphas and run them in parallel, but I would have had to 
<BR>
rewrite all my code. If you want the fastest possible single CPU, alphas are 
<BR>
the way to go. I bought the dual CPU model so I can begin experimenting with
<BR>
parallel stuff without having to go the whole hog all at once. I can
<BR>
afford to be extravagant when spending other people's money ;-).
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I'm not sure.  I have an alpha xlt that I havn't ever been able to get to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; run right (kernel unaligned traps in 1.3, debian install problems with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; debian 2.1).  The sad truth is that alphas aren't (or weren't) really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compatible with each other as far as bootstrapping is concerned, so an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already small user base is further fragmented.  It seems to me that what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really needs to happen to make alternate platform linuxs work is for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; companies that have an interest in the particular platforms to step in and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do some work to support them.  digital made a reasonable effort, from what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I understand compaq has lately more-or-less dumped the line.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm, I'm not sure that this is totally fair, from what I understand Compaq 
<BR>
has given away quite a bit of code recently. But I have to admit, using
<BR>
an NT bootloader is a pretty hackish way to get a linux system up an
<BR>
running. Now that digital seems to be distancing itself from NT ( and
<BR>
vice versa ), top of my wishlist is for them to write firmware that
<BR>
understands the ext2 file system. Get rid of that dumb msdos partition at
<BR>
the start of my disk.
<BR>
<P>Edgar.
