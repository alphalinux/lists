<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Ok I have been lurking for awhile and thought that I would ask the above
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; questions. I am not trying to start a war, I just can't seem to find &quot;real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and practical&quot; answers. So I go to those who actually use alphas for real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; answers. Also keep in mind that I am asking these as a i386 debian user
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who is unwilling to consider other OS as an answer. (Homogenious OS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environment is a nice concept)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why alpha arch? If relating only to network/internet server use is there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any real advantage to alphas? My understanding (I am not an engineer) is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that alphas are better number crunchers. But net IO is so slow that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; multiple nics in a P3 seems to be adaquate for &quot;normal&quot; organizations. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Its cheaper to use a P3 or several as a Server and a 100 MBit/s
<BR>
network should be saturable by a old i386 System. Fast disks are more
<BR>
important there.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If this is true would an alpha serve beter as a cross platform conpiler
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for an i386 network as opposed to a net server? Example would be each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; i386 machine needing custom kernels that would be compiled on a regular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; basis. 
</EM><BR>
<P>gcc uses mostly interger performance at which an Alpha isn´t that much 
<BR>
better than a P3 and given the price a P3 probably has a better &quot;lines
<BR>
of code per price&quot; ratio.
<BR>
<P>What Alphas are best at is number crunching. Examples of this are
<BR>
number crunching like ecdl or rc5, rendering systems like povray,
<BR>
fractal programs like xaos and other fpu extensive programs.
<BR>
<P>Alphas have a much higher fpu throughput than a PC when the code
<BR>
allows for long pipelines, but as ecdl shows integer performance can
<BR>
also be higher than on a PC because of the many registers the alpha
<BR>
has.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What is a good non-archaic alpha to start with? My only alpha experiance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is with AS100a and DUnix4.0d. This would be a debian only, experimental,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; learn why I want to envest in alpha box. I don't want to be bleeding edge,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but something made in the last generation or so would be nice. Also what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be a good comparison to a P3 500, 256MB RAM, 10GB hd. Aprox price?
</EM><BR>
<P>Probably an Alpha 21164 533 MHz, which could be around 2000$, if such
<BR>
are still sold.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Lastly, where to look for reputable dealers? If there are any here please
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speak up :) Are there any evaluation programs available via vendors, etc.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Where do you live? I could name you a german one, but you don´t seem to 
<BR>
be german.
<BR>
<P>May the Source be with you.
