<P>I can NMU these, but is it worth it?  I could understand if it was a year

ahead or so, but it's just a handful of days.  I built 53 packages that

day by hand and would not like to do those all over again if I can help

it.

<P>It wasn't an autobuilder, unfortunately.  I build all of the packages that

I build by hand.  If it was an autobuilder at fault, I'd be less hesitant
<BR>
to regenerate all of those packages.
