<EM>&gt; &gt; Okay, I'm mostly there, installed the base system from floppies and did the linking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; trick so /dev/console is linked to ttyS0.  It gets as far as:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Starting base networking daemons: portmap inetd.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; But of course I have a tulip ethernet card, and there's no tulip module in the install.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Wow.  I really thought there was one.  Are you sure support is not buil
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into the kernel?  All of my machines have tulip cards in them and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; always install over the net.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm pretty sure.  I have a headed machine which I installed at the same time, and ifconfig
<BR>
eth0 up doesn't work on it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; So where can I get a tulip.o module which goes with the Slink install kernel (2.0.36),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; so I can put it on a floppy?  I can't seem to find any kernel-image packages in slink,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; but then again, this would probably be too big for a floppy, though at least I might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; extract a tulip module...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't know.  I verified that there isn't a tulip.o on the install
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disks. :-(
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you tell me you configuration, I can build you a monolithic 2.2 kernel.
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, I got the 2.2.12 which came with the machines, and it boots, the headed machine is
<BR>
fine.  The headless one has had a couple of problems, the last of which I can't figure out
<BR>
for the life of me...
<BR>
<P>First there was:
<BR>
<P>/bin/sh: /dev/tty1: Operation not supported by device [repeated ten times]
<BR>
INIT: ID &quot;1&quot; respawning too fast, disabled for 5 minutes
<BR>
INIT: ID &quot;2&quot; respawning too fast, disabled for 5 minutes
<BR>
<P>I made a new /dev/console, to no avail, then realized that must be from /etc/inittab.  Okay,
<BR>
edited that, commenting out consoles 2-6 and switching tty1 to ttyS0 in the two versions of
<BR>
console 1.
<BR>
<P>Next problem: when I boot, it asks me for a root password!  Rebooting with the rescue floppy
<BR>
and mounting / confirms there is no root password, i.e. in /etc/passwd the root line starts
<BR>
with root:: while the others have :*: but it is still asking me for a password.
<BR>
<P>I try username root, no password, to no avail.  Why did this work on the headed machine, but
<BR>
not on the headless?  Is there something about trying to log in to a non-tty1 type of thing
<BR>
which makes it non-trusted?
<BR>
<P>So, next I try commenting out the login line, and uncommenting the getty line in
<BR>
/etc/inittab.  Trouble is, getty needs a baud rate, and both 38400 (default) and 115200 give
<BR>
me garbage.
<BR>
<P>What should I do?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; (For future releases, it seems that there is ample room in the drivers floppy, maybe a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; tulip module would be a good idea?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Thanks very much once again!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Glad to help. :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>I guess I can partially &quot;repay&quot; you by helping others on the lists, which I'll do my best to
<BR>
do.
