<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; 	Umm, not that I know anything about the problem really, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Netscape generated a Digital Unix binary, wasn't that 64 bit?  Can we find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; out what they did to get a compile?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Basically, they used a Digital Unix cc switch to compile everything as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 32-bit, which eliminates all of the problems.  IMO, it was a cheesy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; workaround for poor portability coding, but it worked at the time.  I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; hoping to see better from the Mozilla packages, but so far, little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; progress has been made to make the beast more port-friendly (they have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; done some neat stuff to the back-end, though, although not related to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; making things 64-bit clean).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	Ick, you're right, that is cheezy.  mozilla.org doesn't list any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 64 bit architectures for port projects, that makes me worry.  Are there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any groups working on one (alpha or other 64 bit arch) that you know of?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	I'd have thought this would have been one of the first projects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; addressed once the source got into public hands.

<P>I was looking on the Debian homepage the other day because I want to work
<BR>
on Debian &quot;offically&quot;.  I've been reading this list for a while now (like
<BR>
they suggested).  Anyway, I saw the LessTif and Mozilla were up for grabs
<BR>
(is that true for Alpha?), so I would like to take those.  I was waiting
<BR>
for the compiler problem (it was fixed, but I'm waiting until most of the
<BR>
packages are rercompilled) and X to be pretty much done before I
<BR>
reinstalled Debian, how are those going?
<BR>
<P>Any thoughts/suggestions?  Even stuff about joining Debian will be
<BR>
welcome.
<BR>
<P>I look forward to joining your team.
