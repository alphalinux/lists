<EM> &gt; 97-8-12 is the latest date.... what's up with this? This seems really
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; old....
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; The Alpha CDR from lsl.com is more expensive than the regular Intel disks
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; because it is CDR not CD write once.... The idea is that Alpha Debian
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; changes too much and they want to be able to do the updates
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; quickly....
</EM><BR>
<P>If Debian Alpha has never been released officially before, this is
<BR>
because there is still some issues that may cause trouble for some
<BR>
people. If a company sell a CDROM from a development snapshot taken
<BR>
from our site more than 6 months ago (AFAIK without trying to contact
<BR>
us, but I may be wrong), they should at least put a big warning
<BR>
disclaimer on it so that people know what to expect. If they did not,
<BR>
feel free to complain to them.
<BR>
<P>We try to ensure that when you see &quot;Official Debian&quot; on something, you
<BR>
have a minimum guarantee on its quality, no Alpha CDROM was never
<BR>
released officially by Debian, so altough we try to encourage people
<BR>
to test our current version (especially as it is very close to be
<BR>
official), people should understand it is still beta.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; I don't mind the small price dif, but it doesn't seem to work.... that has
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; been bothering me a bit....
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Can anyone help with the Debian Alpha install??
</EM><BR>
<P>Did you receive my previous private e-mail about the output of the
<BR>
dmesg when trying to mount the CDROM? Debian and a lot of the free
<BR>
stuff it contains is mostly done by benevolent people on W.E. and
<BR>
nights, so when people are spending time to answer your help request,
<BR>
please read their message carefully (tell me if there was an e-mail
<BR>
problem I will resent it).
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
