<P>
This brings a couple of suggestions to mind.  First, Loic, is there
<BR>
room on the install disks for hwclock about 32K I think.  I'm gonna
<BR>
suggest to the d-boot list that we add an optional 'set time' step to
<BR>
the install procedure for the sake of enabling nfs installs.  Also, it
<BR>
would be keen if this time-set could be committed to CMOS RAM.  (Is
<BR>
that what the UDBs have?)
<BR>
<P>Also, it seems like it would be helpful to add a note to the README in
<BR>
the disks-alpha directory about nfs installs requiring accurate time.
<BR>
<P>Note that the ARC time is not the same as is expected by hwclock.  I
<BR>
originally set the clock with ARC and found that time was in the year
<BR>
1930 after booted.  I recall that there used to be a time program that
<BR>
compreheded ARC time.
<BR>
<P>Cheers.
