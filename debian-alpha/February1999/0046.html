<EM> &gt; As I'm looking into this more, I'm finding that there is another
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; problem, now.  Setting the time fixed an RPC timeout and let the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; installed Debian system nfs mount the server.  However, the setup
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; disks still fail to nfs mount.  I get a report of sendmsg failure with
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; a result of 51.  The errno's say this is a 'level 2 halted' error.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Whatever that means.
</EM><BR>
<P>alpha-~$grep 51 /usr/include/asm/errno.h
<BR>
#define ENETUNREACH     51      /* Network is unreachable */
<BR>
<P>Hmm, are you sure it is a time-related problem?
<BR>
<P>(errnos are not the same on Alpha and others archs)

<EM> &gt; &gt; The &quot;epoch selection&quot; should be done by the kernel, but the code there
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; may be wrong or incomplete.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; The epoch selection is the choice between ARC and UTC in CMOS?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes depending on what it found, the kernel tries to determine an
<BR>
&quot;epoch&quot; (the  difference between the real year and the number set in
<BR>
CMOS), if it was implemented in a sane manner, I would tend to say it
<BR>
could never give 1930.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; It seems to me, IMHO, that it would be a good thing to permit (not
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; require) the user set the time from setup.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure I agree, but maybe this is not related to your problem.
