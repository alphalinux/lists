<P><EM>&gt; Yes it is, but *statically* linked, as there is no libg2c.so.*.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gcc -lf2c similarly *statically* links in libf2c (yes, even though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; libf2c.so.x is available.)  If you make a symbolic link
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; /usr/lib/libf2c.so -&gt; libf2c.so.2 to force the issue, there's a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; link-time error when the dynamic link is attempted.
</EM><BR>
<P>Forgive me here, but why would you want to link it dynamically?  Given the
<BR>
contents of libf2c and libg2c, it wouldn't make a whole lot of sense to
<BR>
dynamically link to either (maybe it's me...I'm kinda ill today, so
<BR>
don't think I'm being insulting).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The required mods are actually mentioned in /usr/doc/f2c/readme, where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it recommends taking out some &quot;long&quot;s on 64-bit long int machines, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even gives a sed command to do it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Glancing at /usr/lib/gcc-lib/alpha-linux/egcs-2.91.60/include/g2c.h
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and /usr/include/f2c.h shows that the long-removal mods are already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; done to g2c.h on the Alpha, but not on i386.
</EM><BR>
<P>Right.  Alignments are different, as are the sizes of each respective data
<BR>
type (ok, I'll agree that they REALLY don't differ on new processors in
<BR>
the x86 family, but egcs ignores that and opts for backward compat, unless
<BR>
told otherwise).
<BR>
<P>The best approach is to modify the f2c package to behave properly on all
<BR>
archs (a series of #ifdef's to isolate the differences should do it) and
<BR>
contact the maintainer with diffs that they can include and test with the
<BR>
next release.  I personally think this is a major bug in f2c since f2c is
<BR>
incorrectly implemented on the Alpha and assumes x86 type sizes apply (for
<BR>
instance, Alpha has no &quot;long long&quot; type and the size of &quot;long&quot; is
<BR>
different between the two).
<BR>
<P>I'm surprised I never caught this before when I was playing with f2c, but
<BR>
it's understandable since I haven't written in Fortran-77 for about 16
<BR>
years now :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In some ways, but (to my knowledge) there is no g77 option to make a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; default integer be 64-bit instead of the default default of 32-bit.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, and never will be.  I see now what you're saying.  No matter what the
<BR>
BLAS stuff will have to be recompiled with proper type sizing and
<BR>
alignment settings.  After that, a recompilation by either method
<BR>
(assuming f2c has been fixed) should produce the same results.
<BR>
<P>A tip, if you decide to modify f2c yourself (time is limited in my realm,
<BR>
so I may not get to it quick enough), you may try altering the machdef.h
<BR>
to use non-hardcoded sizes for the basic types (int, float, etc) and
<BR>
instead, you could try defining things like this:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#define	SZINT	sizeof(int)
<BR>
It might work, but I haven't studied the source intently yet to see if the
<BR>
proper headers are included before machdef.h to pull this off (easy to fix
<BR>
also).  f2c.h could probably be made more generic using this method as
<BR>
well...
