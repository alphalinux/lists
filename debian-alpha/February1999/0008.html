<P>Yes and no.  I would take it back up with Brian stating that we are a
<BR>
release arch candidate here and that the same rules should apply for us as
<BR>
they do with i386, basically that if the &quot;whole source&quot; cannot be
<BR>
distributed with the dist, then we can no longer claim that all of our
<BR>
source and patches are included and available.  In short, if someone likes
<BR>
to &quot;roll their own dist&quot; with Debian on an Alpha, they would not have a
<BR>
smail that worked without unaligned traps everywhere. I could see it if we
<BR>
were an arch that wasn't releasing, but this is an important update to an
<BR>
important package.  Once again, it seems that Alpha is being treated as a
<BR>
&quot;second-class citizen&quot;....
