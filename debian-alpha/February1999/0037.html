<P>
<EM>&gt; I was wondering if it would be possible for me to persuade anyone to submit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me a *merged* alpha/sparc patch for XFree86 so I can put it in -10.
</EM><BR>
<P>Like I mentioned in some other message, my plan was to merge together my 
<BR>
alpha and sparc patches with Steve's sparc patches and send the result to you 
<BR>
(also making sure you get the latest version of all the patches). Of course, 
<BR>
if there is anyone who wants to help, that'd be more than welcome, though I 
<BR>
guess it'd be more in the testing phase of things (the patch merging seems 
<BR>
hard to distribute). I'll announce availability of my test builds to the 
<BR>
lists.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Once I have the integrated patch I will make a test build with it and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; try to determine if it makes any weirdness happen to i386 systems (maybe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'll leave it out of the changelog for the test build so the i386
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; testers will become unwitting guinea pigs of a bigger experiment than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they bargained for, moo ha ha ha).  I'd also like to know if it breaks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on m68k, put those poor guys have to wait 6 days or something for X
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to build, so I'm probably going to have to resort to prayer for that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; architecture.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds like a plan. I'll do a test build on my i386 to make sure it doesn't 
<BR>
fall apart completely on you though ;-)
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
/Anders
