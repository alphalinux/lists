<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; It seems to me it would be much more sensible to either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;   a) implement http/ftp and ignore this problem with nfs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Remember that we are talking about installing base.  There aren't the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; facilities for apt at this point in the installation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I know, and I am quite aware there are some &lt;50k http/ftp client packages
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around. It is fairly easy to setup/get a http server for the base image,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nfs can be alot trickier.
</EM><BR>
<P>So, are you sating it is OK to install a new program on the install
<BR>
diskettes for performing ftp and not OK to add a switch to apt/dselect
<BR>
in the setup program in base?  It seems to me that logging the output
<BR>
of the initial setup run is much less risky that reworking the setup
<BR>
disks to handle a new method of fetching base.
<BR>
<P>Besides, setting the clock is something we could use during install.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;   b) sync the local clock to the server clock using trivial time protocol
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;      this is the smallest and most reliable option [netdate is 9k]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This could work.  The trouble is that we need to set it in CMOS, too.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This isn't a problem with getting the correct date.  I don't believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that the clocks must be exactly the same.  Thus, netdate is one method
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for getting the date, but it seems more appropriate to make it a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; general change to setup where the user can set the system clock.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It seems to be a general failing of the alphas that the cmos clock doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work so I wouldn't worry too much about that till someone fixes it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know what you mean by this.  I *am* working to fix it.
