Because of the urgency here, I'm forwarding this to the port lists.

<P>If anyone can send Anders or me some clues, I'd appreciate it greatly.

<EM>&gt; I haven't heard of any troubles with my last attempt at merging the X sources,

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to your -10 release.
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, I did so, and ran into problems.
<BR>
<P>All the stuff outside debian/ applied with no problems whatsoever.
<BR>
<P>I merged all the stuff in debian/ by hand and rewrote a bit of it.  There
<BR>
were some files in that part of the patch that weren't even being used
<BR>
anymore (create-arch-xsun-utils, for instance), so I omitted them.
<BR>
<P>There are two significant problems:
<BR>
<P>1) Lots and lots of stuff isn't getting built at all for i386, and it
<BR>
should be.  This is not due to errors; apparently the targets are just
<BR>
being ignored.
<BR>
<P>2) There is a problem building the S3 server:
<BR>
cfb/libcfb.a(cfb8cppl.o): In function `cfbCopyPlane8to1':
<BR>
cfb8cppl.o(.text+0xc3): undefined reference to `ffsl'
<BR>
<P>This is the only build error caused by the patch.  I suspect something
<BR>
should be #ifdef'ed out.
<BR>
<P>I have made a directory with lots of info in it for you, if you could
<BR>
please help me out with this.
<BR>
<P>It's on master, and is ~branden/anders.
<BR>
<P>It contains the buildlogs with the alpha/sparc patch applied, and then with
<BR>
them backed out (the stuff in debian/ was left alone).  Nevermind the
<BR>
errors at the end of the buildlogs when the packages are being created.  I
<BR>
had some bugs in the debian/* files but I got rid of them.  The second
<BR>
build (with the patches backed out), I completed successfully by hand.
<BR>
<P>I also have file lists after the build of the contents of xtree and
<BR>
xtree-libc5 for both compiles (with the patch and without).  xtree-libc5 is
<BR>
not different, but lots of files are missing from xtree with the patch in
<BR>
place.  A diff between list.xtree and list.xtree.alphasparc will show this.
<BR>
<P>Finally, I have a complete source package for you to look at.
<BR>
<P>Can you figure this out?
<BR>
<P>If all else fails, I guess I need to do an arch check in debian/rules for
<BR>
alpha or sparc, and apply your patch only if those arches are set.  But I'd
<BR>
rather not do it this way at this point.
<BR>
<P>But if you can find no reasonable explanation for all the missing files,
<BR>
I'll do it that way.
<BR>
<P>Finally, it was suggested to me that maybe, somehow, the heavy disk
<BR>
activity on saens (where I built) may have messed up timestamps somehow and
<BR>
confused make, and that's why stuff didn't get built.  I don't really think
<BR>
that's what happened, but if you can find no better explanation...
<BR>
<P>I checked over the config/cf files and could find no patch that was applied
<BR>
that obviously would have affected i386 like this.  So I am very puzzled.
<BR>
