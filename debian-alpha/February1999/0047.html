<EM>&gt; I think we cannot underestimate some technical issues, uploading new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; source for an arch can introduce problems for another, which will need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a new upload, and this can creates long delays (if not an endless loop).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IMHO, we are to the point where we should not need to rebuilt a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; package for every arch,  because of a bug fix relevant to only one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (of course to be fair, this principle should apply to i386 also). 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What may be done fo instance is :
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - tolerate (or maybe enforce) that some arch have a binary package not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corresponding to the latest source in slink, if latest slink source has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a debian revision with 3 digit (the last digit means the last changes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was more or less arch-specific, or it was a 64bit issue).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alternatively we could tolerate that an arch has some binary package
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in slink from the source in potato, but that would be very awkward.
</EM><BR>
<P>The final result is the patch in BTS and no fixed source. I &quot;spoke&quot; to Brian
<BR>
and he understood the problem, but tries to minimize the code changes at this
<BR>
point. So maybe there should be some location in the archive where you can
<BR>
upload these architecture patches. The BTS does not seem the right place to
<BR>
me (not for people who want to build from source themselves). This is handy
<BR>
for the time between a patched version and the time a developer actualy
<BR>
releasing a version with this patch. (I think also about the difficult
<BR>
packages like XFree86 or libc6 where on all different platform patches are
<BR>
made).
