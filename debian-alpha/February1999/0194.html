<EM>&gt; &gt; The latest boot-floppies 2.1.6 for m68k just arrived in Incoming;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the only thing I'd like to change (undiscovered blatant bugs aside)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is upgrading the VME and Mac kernels to 2.0.36 (Nick is doing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; VME kernel packages, and I'll try to do the Mac part). After that,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'd consider switching to boot-floppies 2.1.7 (if there's enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; time until release).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even after we release, officially, I think it's important to keep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; working on the boot floppies, on the documentation, and on the CD.

<P>Adam, just a general comment from my side (I realize that you are not
<BR>
responsible for this, but you asked): Personally, I'm screaming mad
<BR>
that I find new updates to base packages almost every day on master
<BR>
even
<BR>
though we're in a pretty prolonged freeze now. Meaning I can't just
<BR>
rebuild part of the boot-floppies but have to go through the full
<BR>
cycle again 
<BR>
which takes around 4-5 hours each time on the machine I use. It still
<BR>
requires manually adding the Mac magic, and general babysitting the 
<BR>
build process, can only be done after office hours etc. 
<BR>
<P>I realize that it's important to keep working on all these things, but
<BR>
working on the m68k boot floppies for over a month now has taken a far
<BR>
bigger chunk out of my day than I can afford to spend in future.
<BR>
Frankly,
<BR>
it won't be me to continue working on this.
