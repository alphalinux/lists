<P>
Thanks.
<BR>
<P>Have you noticed the unaligned traps that appear to be in the
<BR>
stdlibg++ library?  I'd look into it, but my lowly UDB compiles very
<BR>
slowly.

<EM>&gt; Hi all...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, I recompiled glibc with the __register_frame_info patch and it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being uploaded as we speak. I have tested it with binaries both with and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without __register_frame_info and have had great success.  Thanks to Loic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the hard work on this!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I *STRONGLY* urge everyone to upgrade their systems to glibc -2 (should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in master today or tomorrow) and the new egcs that was uploaded yesterday,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even if you are not doing active development for Debian right now.  These
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; releases solve compatibility problems that may prevent you from running
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Debian-compiled binaries on RH (or other) Linux-Alpha systems.
