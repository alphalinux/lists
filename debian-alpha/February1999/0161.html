<P>
[ Apologies for the major cross-post - I need input from lots of you... ]
<BR>
<P>Consensus on -testing appears to be that we're about ready to ship the
<BR>
i386 release. I'm adding the final touches to the slink-cd script (v 1.06)
<BR>
right now. Changes from slink-cd v 1.05 up to now are: 
<BR>
<P>slink-cd (1.06) unstable; urgency=low
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;* slink_cd changes:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*     handle non-US links better
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*     Copy Release Notes onto all CDs
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*     Create README.1ST - lists slink_cd version, creation date, disk label
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(from .disk/info) and gives simple instructions on what to do to run 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the installation system.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*     Copy the full set of files for the installation manual to /install.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*     Add sym-links for the installation manual into /doc.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* others:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*     Created README.1ST.i386 - template for README.1ST above.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*     Removed test genlinks option from arch.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*     Added hfs.map for Apple people - not sure what to do with it yet.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*     Added mkisofsrc to packaging.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Where are we up to on non-i386 boot/installation? If we're going to
<BR>
release together, which I assume is still the plan, then we need to get
<BR>
this sorted _soon_. I know someone (Eric? Stephane?) is working on the
<BR>
sparc disks and I have some support for them now. I've seen work ongoing
<BR>
on the m68k disks, too. I've not seen much for Alpha yet, but that may be
<BR>
my fault.
<BR>
<P>Also, this is the contents of the README.1ST.i386 file I've written, which
<BR>
will hopefully be the first thing people will look at if they need help on
<BR>
getting the installation system up. Comments/changes are welcome. And
<BR>
similar information for other arches would also help a lot.
<BR>

README for Debian 2.1 CD installation.
<BR>
======================================
<BR>
<P>To boot the installation system from CD, you will need to insert
<BR>
either CD#1 or CD#2 in your CD-ROM drive and reboot. 
<BR>
<P>CD#1 contains a normal kernel that should work for most people and
<BR>
contains many drivers. 
<BR>
<P>CD#2 is a smaller system based on the &quot;tecra&quot; kernel - this is smaller
<BR>
because it has fewer drivers compiled in to avoid a known problem with
<BR>
large kernels on laptops, especially the Toshiba Tecra series.
<BR>
<P>If your system will not boot from CD, there are other options:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Boot a DOS system with CD drivers, then run /install/boot.bat from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the first CD.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Make boot floppies from the images on the first CD, in the directory
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;/dists/stable/main/disks-i386/current. The program rawrite2.exe in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that directory will write the floppy images under DOS.
<BR>
<P>See /install/install.txt for more information.

Getting a SCSI chain working is perfectly simple if you remember that there
must be exactly three terminations: one on one end of the cable, one on the
far end, and the goat, terminated over the SCSI chain with a silver-handled
knife whilst burning *black* candles. --- Anthony DeBoer
