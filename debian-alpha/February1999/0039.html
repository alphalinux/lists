<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt; Also, it seems like it would be helpful to add a note to the README in

<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt; the disks-alpha directory about nfs installs requiring accurate time.

<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I was not aware of that, do you know where is this restriction needed?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (I know I used NFS for some time  between a machine in year 2018 and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; normal ones).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ditto (ok, not 2018 but certainly off by a couple of hours). I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understand why this should be a problem for NFS; after all, NFS is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stateless... It's a pain if using 'make' on a NFS directory, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; otherwise no problem.
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe it is a problem for RPC, not for NFS itself.  The NFS server
<BR>
believes that the connection is made, but the client RPC returns with
<BR>
a timeout error.

<EM>&gt; &gt; The &quot;epoch selection&quot; should be done by the kernel, but the code there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The RTC stuff needs to be selected in the kernel config for this to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is.
