<EM> &gt; &gt; Brian rejected the i386 part (source and binary). The alpha part got in

<EM> &gt; Yes and no.  I would take it back up with Brian stating that we are a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; release arch candidate here and that the same rules should apply for us as
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; they do with i386, basically that if the &quot;whole source&quot; cannot be
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; distributed with the dist, then we can no longer claim that all of our
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; source and patches are included and available.  In short, if someone likes
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to &quot;roll their own dist&quot; with Debian on an Alpha, they would not have a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; smail that worked without unaligned traps everywhere. I could see it if we
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; were an arch that wasn't releasing, but this is an important update to an
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; important package.  Once again, it seems that Alpha is being treated as a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &quot;second-class citizen&quot;....
</EM><BR>
<P>I think we cannot underestimate some technical issues, uploading new
<BR>
source for an arch can introduce problems for another, which will need
<BR>
a new upload, and this can creates long delays (if not an endless loop).
<BR>
<P>IMHO, we are to the point where we should not need to rebuilt a
<BR>
package for every arch,  because of a bug fix relevant to only one
<BR>
(of course to be fair, this principle should apply to i386 also). 
<BR>
What may be done fo instance is :
<BR>
- tolerate (or maybe enforce) that some arch have a binary package not
<BR>
corresponding to the latest source in slink, if latest slink source has
<BR>
a debian revision with 3 digit (the last digit means the last changes
<BR>
was more or less arch-specific, or it was a 64bit issue).
<BR>
<P>Alternatively we could tolerate that an arch has some binary package
<BR>
in slink from the source in potato, but that would be very awkward.
