<EM>&gt;     now=2655075170 last interrupt=-1639977453 ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you cast 2655075170 into an int, you get -1639892126.

<P>It could very well be that obvious.  I found a similar problem with the
<BR>
future version of ping (as well as ping6 for IPv6) where half of the code
<BR>
properly used sizeof(struct timeval) to get the proper amount of chars to
<BR>
use to store the time, but the other half just assumed that the size of
<BR>
the struct was 8.
<BR>
<P>Seems like alot of revision has been done, but an equal amount of things
<BR>
was overlooked in both kernel and application source code quite often.
<BR>
<P>I could work up a diff for you for 2.2.1 if you'd like (and change the
<BR>
glibc 2.1 package as well, when I can)....
