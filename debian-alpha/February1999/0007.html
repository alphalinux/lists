<P>Yes, it simply won't compile without a ton of patching.  We had a 2.7.2.1
<BR>
for about 6-8 months, but when 2.7.2.3 came out, no one had all of the
<BR>
patches that had been applied to 2.7.2.1, and we would've had to start
<BR>
over.  This is not to mention the NUMEROUS problems that we had with
<BR>
2.7.2.1 (no exception-handling, BIG optimiser bugs, etc). The
<BR>
responce from the gcc lists when I asked for Alpha support was all &quot;well,
<BR>
just use egcs until 2.8.0 comes out&quot; at the time, so we started with it.
<BR>
<P>It's done us proud for awhile, despite the sometimes buggy nature of such
<BR>
an aggressive development model, but it works far more reliably for us
<BR>
than even gcc 2.8.x has (I do run tests on those still).
