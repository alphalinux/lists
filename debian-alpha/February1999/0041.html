<EM>&gt; Have you noticed the unaligned traps that appear to be in the

<EM>&gt; stdlibg++ library?  I'd look into it, but my lowly UDB compiles very

<P>Same here.  I ran the binutils build yesterday (5+ hours) and now a SECOND
<BR>
glibc build (7+ hours) on it to keep track of the builds better.  I missed
<BR>
something on the glibc build, though, so I'm redoing it.  If there's a
<BR>
problem with libg++, though, I can poke at egcs tomorrow and see what the
<BR>
deal is.  Any better reference as to what I'm looking for?
