Hi all...
<BR>
<P>Well, I recompiled glibc with the __register_frame_info patch and it's
<BR>
being uploaded as we speak. I have tested it with binaries both with and
<BR>
without __register_frame_info and have had great success.  Thanks to Loic
<BR>
for the hard work on this!
<BR>
<P>I *STRONGLY* urge everyone to upgrade their systems to glibc -2 (should be
<BR>
in master today or tomorrow) and the new egcs that was uploaded yesterday,
<BR>
even if you are not doing active development for Debian right now.  These
<BR>
releases solve compatibility problems that may prevent you from running
<BR>
Debian-compiled binaries on RH (or other) Linux-Alpha systems.
<BR>
<P>C
