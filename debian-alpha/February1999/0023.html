<EM>&gt; I honestly cannot say I have seen a Linux system acting as a fileserver,

<P>I have.  The trouble is that Samba isn't poised to replace NT in this
<BR>
area since most organizations (needing Samba) already have an NT
<BR>
domain and aren't prepared to abandon it.  Note that they chose NT in
<BR>
the first place.  BTW, there is some speculation that Samba isn't
<BR>
*really* faster than NT on the same hardware.  I haven't heard doubts
<BR>
as to the greater stability of the underlying OS.

<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Basically, all Debian distributions look the same, regardless of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; underlying architecture - because they are built from the same set of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sources.

<P><EM>&gt; Secondly; I propose the beginnings of a Debian offshoot. Now, something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tells me that this will be met with a great deal of resistance (from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people who brought you vrms.deb;), but I believe it may be in all of our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; best interests, to further garner market approval and acceptance of Linux.

<P>No one is going to tell you that you can't do XZY with Debian...as
<BR>
long as you abide by the licenses.  Making Debian more appealing and
<BR>
accessible to suit-wearers is a clear and positive intent.  I don't
<BR>
see any reason for there to be an 'offshoot' project since there is
<BR>
nothing to leave behind.  In other words, we can improve existing
<BR>
configuration management, add new architectures, and support
<BR>
commercial apps (as debs) without doing anything different than we
<BR>
already do.  What's to resist?
