Hello,
<BR>
<P>I was wondering if it would be possible for me to persuade anyone to submit
<BR>
me a *merged* alpha/sparc patch for XFree86 so I can put it in -10.
<BR>
<P>All I personally own is an i386 box.  An integrated patch would also mean
<BR>
that I don't apply one and then watch 100 rejects happen when I apply the
<BR>
other one.
<BR>
<P>Also, if the alpha and sparc porting teams can do this, it reduces the
<BR>
likelihood of weird side effects on i386 -- I figure that once you've
<BR>
insulated two arches from each other, it makes it less likely that either of
<BR>
them will work bad medicine on a third.
<BR>
<P>Finally for the really frank reasons: release time is really drawing nigh,
<BR>
and it would be time consuming for me to handle this task myself.  There
<BR>
are a few other issues I want -10 to resolve -- which brings me to the
<BR>
other really frank reason.  I'm no C wizard -- but porters usually are, or
<BR>
are at least more conversant with things like enforcement of aligned memory
<BR>
access than I am.
<BR>
<P>This message is to Anders and Steve, who each have worked on these issues
<BR>
before, but I'm cc'ing the respective port lists so they don't feel I'm
<BR>
just dumping this back in their laps.  Unless they say they don't want help
<BR>
(mythical man-month issues?), let me issue this plea for folks to assist
<BR>
them.
<BR>
<P>Once I have the integrated patch I will make a test build with it and
<BR>
try to determine if it makes any weirdness happen to i386 systems (maybe
<BR>
I'll leave it out of the changelog for the test build so the i386
<BR>
testers will become unwitting guinea pigs of a bigger experiment than
<BR>
they bargained for, moo ha ha ha).  I'd also like to know if it breaks
<BR>
on m68k, put those poor guys have to wait 6 days or something for X
<BR>
to build, so I'm probably going to have to resort to prayer for that
<BR>
architecture.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I am cognizant of the non-i386 folks feeling like second-class
<BR>
citizens and I want to do what I can to relieve that problem.
<BR>
Fundamentally, though, I'm a control freak and I don't like to see NMU's
<BR>
of X.  But where I am not competent to handle something, I have to delegate
<BR>
it.  Hence this message.
<BR>
<P>Well, I've gone on long enough.  Feel free to mail me with any questions,
<BR>
especially about my psychotic maintainer scripts.
<BR>
<P><PRE>
