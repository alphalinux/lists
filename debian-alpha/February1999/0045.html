<EM>&gt; &gt; Have you noticed the unaligned traps that appear to be in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; stdlibg++ library?  I'd look into it, but my lowly UDB compiles very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; slowly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Same here.  I ran the binutils build yesterday (5+ hours) and now a SECOND
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; glibc build (7+ hours) on it to keep track of the builds better.  I missed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something on the glibc build, though, so I'm redoing it.  If there's a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem with libg++, though, I can poke at egcs tomorrow and see what the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deal is.  Any better reference as to what I'm looking for?
</EM><BR>
<P>OK.  You shamed me.  Anyway, I have been configuring my second UDB
<BR>
just so I can do things like this.  So...I'll try to build it myself
<BR>
and check back with you.
<BR>
<P>The trouble I'm seeing is that a newly installed slink system (and an
<BR>
upgraded slink system) started generating unaligned traps at an
<BR>
execution address that preceeds main on a program of mine. On further
<BR>
exploration, I found that other programs linked against
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;libstdc++-libc6.0-1.so.2 =&gt; /usr/lib/libstdc++-libc6.0-1.so.2 (0x0000020000104000)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
generate the same errors: apt-get, update-menus.  My guess is a new
<BR>
unaligned trap in the library setup code.
