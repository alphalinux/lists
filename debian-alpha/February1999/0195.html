<EM>&gt; Adam, just a general comment from my side (I realize that you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not responsible for this, but you asked): Personally, I'm screaming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mad that I find new updates to base packages almost every day on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; master even though we're in a pretty prolonged freeze now. Meaning I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't just rebuild part of the boot-floppies but have to go through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the full cycle again which takes around 4-5 hours each time on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machine I use. It still requires manually adding the Mac magic, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; general babysitting the build process, can only be done after office
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hours etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think Adam was speaking in general terms (i.e. so we're ready for
<BR>
making potato stuff without suddenly running around like headless
<BR>
chickens a month before release).
<BR>
<P>As far as boot-floppies for m68k (and other platforms, for that
<BR>
matter) goes, I don't see any need to keep them in daily sync with the
<BR>
installed packages on master.  IMHO as long as the base system is
<BR>
functioning, the user's first dselect run should take care of anything
<BR>
that has been superseded.  People installing from frozen can deal with
<BR>
it until it becomes Really Frozen (tm) at the end of the week; then we
<BR>
can build new disk images from the archives and make sure they work
<BR>
with a week to spare until we're Really Really Frozen And We *Really*
<BR>
Mean It This Time (tm).
