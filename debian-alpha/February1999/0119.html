<EM> &gt; Hello,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; after not using my Jensen for quite some time, I decided to try debian. I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; used both a ftp install from ftp.de.debian.org (unstable) and a local mirror
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; (by nfs) from the same server:
</EM><BR>
<P>Hello,
<BR>
<P>Thanks for your report,
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  - boot aboot/kernel from CD, root=/dev/fd0 load_ramdisk=1 (if you don't
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;    have a aboot-bootable CD, use the jensen stuff from
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; azstarnet.com)
</EM><BR>
<P>I will try to put that stuff in the jensen rescue disk. And I planned
<BR>
for a long time to look at Debian CD generation, to ensure the Alpha
<BR>
one is aboot-able.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;  - use root1440.img (from slink) - what is the purpose of the rescue disk
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;    from jensen/resc1440.bin? It can't be booted anyway on that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  machine.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, when I made the disks, I was not sure if it was still the case,
<BR>
thanks for the precision.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, the disk will still be needed for the &quot;Install Operating
<BR>
System&quot; step in the installation, to avoid a special case for the
<BR>
jensen (but this step is not yet completely finished), and my rational
<BR>
was to put on the rescue disk all that was necessary up to booting the
<BR>
kernel, so I will add the right stuff for the Jensen one (not that the
<BR>
Jensen disk is abootable, so currently it might already be possible to
<BR>
create a bootable Jensen CD by doing a raw copy of resc1440.bin on a
<BR>
gold CD).
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;  - install base system (have to use fdisk in BSD disklabel mode on console
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;    2, instead of cfdisk, and reboot after partitioning).
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  - boot kernel from CD, with root=/dev/sda3 and proceed installation
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Compared to my last RedHat installation, things went quite smooth - no big
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Jensen-specific trouble (except that the automatic gpm configuration crashed
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the whole machine by accessing ttyS1 - seems to be a kernel
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; problem).
</EM><BR>
<P>I will check, I think there was already a problem report related to
<BR>
serial ports.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Now I am running into some dependency problems when using apt-get / dselect
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; - that bad thing is that apt reports dependency problems when doing a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 'upgrade' from the dselect menu, and will not even start downloading
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; packages, so I used the local mirror via NFS/dselect. However, I still get
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; dependency problems in the form of 'depends on xlib6g',
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; xlib6g_3.3.2.3a-8, which is not yet available for alpha?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I guess this is normal for 'unstable', however: where do I report these?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes some dependecies are still in a transient state, this is the right 
<BR>
list to report them.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Another thing: I merged the debian aboot diff with my internal aboot version
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; (now at 0.53), and will update the stuff on azstarnet soon.
</EM><BR>
<P>Cool,
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
<P>Loic
