<EM>&gt;  &gt; As I'm looking into this more, I'm finding that there is another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; problem, now.  Setting the time fixed an RPC timeout and let the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; installed Debian system nfs mount the server.  However, the setup
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; disks still fail to nfs mount.  I get a report of sendmsg failure with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; a result of 51.  The errno's say this is a 'level 2 halted' error.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Whatever that means.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alpha-~$grep 51 /usr/include/asm/errno.h
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; #define ENETUNREACH     51      /* Network is unreachable */
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hmm, are you sure it is a time-related problem?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (errnos are not the same on Alpha and others archs)
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, that is why the error was so odd.
<BR>
<P>Actually, these are different problems.  One is caused by assymetry in
<BR>
the DNS tables, the err51, and the other is caused by time.  I had a
<BR>
small meltdown here for a few hours.  My cat likes to perch on the
<BR>
UDB, but her fur lodged in the power supply and made it reboot
<BR>
spontaneously.  I wasn't so calm about this a few hours ago, but now I
<BR>
can laugh.  I bought a new battery because I thought that was the
<BR>
trouble.
<BR>
<P>The result is that I didn't make any headway for about six hours while
<BR>
I ran the errand and fussed with the computer.  I'll verify whether
<BR>
time really is the problem in a few days when I return from Canada.

<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt; The &quot;epoch selection&quot; should be done by the kernel, but the code there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt; may be wrong or incomplete.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; The epoch selection is the choice between ARC and UTC in CMOS?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes depending on what it found, the kernel tries to determine an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;epoch&quot; (the  difference between the real year and the number set in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CMOS), if it was implemented in a sane manner, I would tend to say it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could never give 1930.
</EM><BR>
<P>Could?  Did.  I'm gonna run though this again when I get home.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; It seems to me, IMHO, that it would be a good thing to permit (not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; require) the user set the time from setup.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sure I agree, but maybe this is not related to your problem.
</EM><BR>
<P>And maybe it is.  I had two machines that were identical except for
<BR>
the amount of memory...and the time of day.  One could NFS mount from
<BR>
the boot floppy and the other could not.  
<BR>
<P>I'll eat crow with gusto if I cannot reproduce the problem.
<BR>
<P>Cheers.
