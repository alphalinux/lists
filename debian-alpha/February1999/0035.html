<P><EM>&gt; Well, I recompiled glibc with the __register_frame_info patch and it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being uploaded as we speak. I have tested it with binaries both with and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without __register_frame_info and have had great success.  Thanks to Loic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the hard work on this!

<P>Good work, Loic and Chris!  Have a beer! :-)
<BR>
<P>I'll do whatever is on my diff list this evening insofar no one else has
<BR>
jumped in yet.  I gather that for RECOMPILES you're using the .0.1
<BR>
extension to the version number? That makes sense (I remember something
<BR>
from debian-devel that .0.1 should indicate a recompile-only upload).
<BR>
<P>Just to reiterate one of my pet peeves: If you're uploading something
<BR>
of which the source was uploaded BEFORE the freeze, DO NOT FORGET TO FIX
<BR>
THE CHANGELOG so that it says &quot;frozen unstable&quot;.  A couple of my uploads
<BR>
(to frozen unstable) were rejected because that version number was
<BR>
already in unstable a.k.a. potato... Reuploading with a hacked changes
<BR>
file that only said &quot;frozen&quot; fixed that, but it's a complete waste of
<BR>
my time if the upload was done already...
<BR>
<P>Especially now we're recompiling stuff, perhaps from before the freeze,
<BR>
this is doubly important!
