Hi all...
<BR>
<P>Well, I got my RAM in and just booted up my new SX164 tonight :-)  For
<BR>
s&amp;g's, I used the slink CD's that were kindly sent to me and it works
<BR>
fantastically :-)  Wow, what a change from my UDB!
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I still have a long way to go on this machine (gotta move the
<BR>
UDB's 4G Barracuda over and modify it's boot process...this 200MB IDE
<BR>
drive just isn't gonna cut it for anything), but I'm hoping to have it up
<BR>
and officially on the Net by Monday.  In the meantime, I'm still available
<BR>
for builds, but will have to do so exclusively on a.d.nl.  Oh, also I
<BR>
worked out a deal with my employer where I get to sit the new Alpha
<BR>
(hostname is 'spawn' btw...I'm a huge comic fan) on the Net proper in
<BR>
exchange for hosting a work-related database that's currently under
<BR>
development by me on a crappy old Pentium 75 (also Debian).  If/Once I get
<BR>
more Barracudas, I'll be offering a full mirror of slink and potato source
<BR>
and may be able to grant build accounts on it (we'll see how my uptime
<BR>
goes after the first two weeks).
<BR>
<P>At any rate, there's more good news.  Between myself, the upstream
<BR>
authors, and the maintainers of PostgreSQL, Debian will shortly have a
<BR>
functional PostgreSQL package set for Alphas :-) And, yes, it'll be based
<BR>
on the brand spankin' new 6.5 release.  It took some ugly work, but I got
<BR>
it going and I must say that Oliver (the Debian maintainer of postgresql)
<BR>
was extremely helpful in resolving this.  Just a little ego boost to
<BR>
Debian: I believe we'll be the first distribution with a working
<BR>
PostgreSQL on the Alpha :-)  Thanks also go to Bart for lighting the
<BR>
proverbial fire under my butt to get this done :-)
<BR>
<P>Lastly, John just notified me that the GNUME packages that I uploaded
<BR>
recently need a recompile.  There was an anomoly introduced by fakeroot
<BR>
that hosed the whole set of packages.  Expect a rebuild by me based on the
<BR>
new gnome-libs package set, all NMU.  It'll take me a few days to
<BR>
accomplish this, but I should be able to finish by Monday or Tuesday (in
<BR>
case anyone is really into GNOME).
<BR>
<P>That's it :-)  Happy Alpha-ing!
<BR>
