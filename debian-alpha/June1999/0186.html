<P>No, not at all.  In fact, I found this out first-hand with an aha1542 and
<BR>
my SX.  Granted, it's an ISA board that uses DMA, but the driver's
<BR>
presence in the kernel tree definitely did not mean it worked :-(  It
<BR>
turns out that, according to a few sources, getting it to work would be
<BR>
much harder than just buying a new SCSI host adapter.  The problem lied
<BR>
with the DMA facilities of the board itself not being able to map
<BR>
addresses properly (if I understood the explanation correctly) onto the
<BR>
Alpha's &gt; 2G addresses.  Alot of older hardware will probably not work
<BR>
with Alphas (not to mention others), but PCI cards generally work in my
<BR>
experience if they follow the PCI 2.1 spec.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, my 3c509 ISA ethernet board works fine in my SX (as do
<BR>
two other ISA NICs).  It really depends on how they map themselves into
<BR>
memory.
<BR>
<P>FYI, alot of the current kernel drivers assume x86-ish things (such as
<BR>
memory mapping or BIOS recognition) which cannot be easily accomplished or
<BR>
emulated on other hosts.  On Alpha, we have almost a &quot;virtual bios32&quot;
<BR>
system that runs in the kernel when initialising and talking to devices,
<BR>
but it's not perfect nor can it catch every instance.  Since Alphas are
<BR>
ALOT closer to x86 motherboard architecture, many boards work on Alpha
<BR>
that also work on x86, but I'm sure that other hosts (MIPS, m68k, etc)
<BR>
differ more greatly and the chance of finding non-working drivers on those
<BR>
platforms increases.
