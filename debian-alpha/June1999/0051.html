<P>I'll look at the beta package that you've done and see if it's still
<BR>
broken for us.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The source diff file should show all of that.  Most of the changes are to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Makefiles and pathnames.
</EM><BR>
<P>I noticed that, but there were some things that I've only glanced at so
<BR>
far, so I don't know what they're totally accomplishing as of yet.  I'll
<BR>
check the new package and see if I still have questions and/or problems.
<BR>
<P>I will most definitely need to provide you with a patch (very simple) to
<BR>
fix Alpha compilation with egcs (it's only one line that needs to be
<BR>
changed).  I will wait, though, until I can figure out if there are any
<BR>
more changes.  I'm going to be working on this today and tonight, so you
<BR>
should know soon.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The main place to look for port-specific stuff is now src/config*.
</EM><BR>
<P>Got it.  Thanks a ton!
