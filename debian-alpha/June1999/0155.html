Howdy:
<BR>
<P>I have a new Compaq XP1000 box. According to a tech at Compaq, it's a Monet 
<BR>
Veriosn using the Tsunami Chipset, or maybe the other way around. It's an EV6 
<BR>
alpha. Plenty of RAM, IBM SCSI disks.
<BR>
<P>I tried to install Debian 2.1 on it and ran into a few interesting errors.
<BR>
<P>I chose the generic kernel.
<BR>
<P>I had to fdisk it by hand. I set it up with a BSD Disklabel, as this allows 
<BR>
the SRM to find the partitions itself. At first I had it set up 4 partitions, 
<BR>
a as root, b as swap, d as var, and e as usr (or so I hoped...)
<BR>
<P>It never seemed to recognize beyond the first partition. 
<BR>
Fdisk also gets the virtual drive geometry wrong.
<BR>
<P>Lastly, it fails the &quot;Smoke&quot; test. It never offers to install boot blocks, and 
<BR>
The boot floppy kernel panics when it tries to mount /dev/sda1.
<BR>
<P>Any ideas, input or questions would be appreciated.
<BR>
<P>(For those who might wonder, I did get RedHat 6.0 to install on a similar box. 
<BR>
The diffs between that and 2.1 might be telling...)
<BR>
