Hello,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been running slink with a 2.2.8 kernel on an LX system for
<BR>
some time now.  Unitl recently I have been dual booting between NT and
<BR>
linux and everything seemed to be working fine.  However, recently I have
<BR>
had the machine running for about three weeks and I have noticed something
<BR>
strange about the memory allocation.  Whenever I first booted, a quick
<BR>
glance at top revealed that the system was using about 40MB of ram.
<BR>
However, as time went on, this number crept upward.  Before I had just
<BR>
assumed that memory was not reallocated until another process needed it,
<BR>
which would explain why the amount of memory used increases over time.
<BR>
However, since I have had the system up for some time, the amount of
<BR>
memory used exceded  the 256MB of ram that I have in the machine.  A
<BR>
glance at top recently revealed this:
<BR>
<P>Mem:  256720K av, 244176K used,  12544K free,  28200K shrd,  86584K buff
<BR>
Swap: 523640K av,   8744K used, 514896K free                103216K cached
<BR>
<P>At this moment I was running nothing except several xterms, xwindows and a
<BR>
few daemons which take very little use.  The X server has by far the
<BR>
largest memory requirement and it takes only 19MB of ram.  Is there anyway
<BR>
for me to find out what program is using memory so inefficently that I
<BR>
have begun to use swap for day to day applications?  This is most puzzling
<BR>
to me, so any help would be very appreciated.
<BR>
