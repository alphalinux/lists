<EM>  &gt;Speaking of which...I've been working on the Alpha port and have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt;wrestling with 6.4.2 and the 6.5beta1 for awhile now.  I finally got it to
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt;compile and run (using bare upstream source), but using the patched
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt;source package (directly from master), psql bombs with a palloc error.
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt;I was curious as to what is in the future of the package?  Do you intend
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt;on patching 6.5 with the same set of patches that accompany 6.4.2?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
In part, only.
<BR>
<P><EM>  &gt;If that's the case, I guess I'll have to work with you on what the problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt;might be with the Alpha.  Egcs is one of our evils (postgresql showcases
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt;an optimiser bug in egcs and must be compiled totally without optimisation
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt;in order to work...spinlock code, fyi), but I can't track the rest down.
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt;Even gdb isn't helping :-(
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt;If you can (and have time), can you send me an explanation of what you
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt;patched so that I can begin tracking down the change that causes the error
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt;that we're encountering?  Thanks!
</EM><BR>

The source diff file should show all of that.  Most of the changes are to 
<BR>
Makefiles and pathnames.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=============================
<BR>
<P>To all porters:
<BR>
<P>I have put together a preliminary release of 6.5 (beta2) and the source
<BR>
for it can be obtained from <A HREF="http://www.lfix.co.uk/postgresql.">http://www.lfix.co.uk/postgresql.</A>  Could you
<BR>
please try to build that and send me any diffs you may need to make.
<BR>
<P>If you are really fast, there is a small chance of getting fixes into the
<BR>
new upstream release, which is due tomorrow if no-one finds any other
<BR>
show-stopping bugs.
<BR>
<P>The main place to look for port-specific stuff is now src/config*.
<BR>
<P>NB: I am NOT subscribed to any of the debian-&lt;port&gt; lists; please cc me.
