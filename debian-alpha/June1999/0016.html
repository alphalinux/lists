<P>
<EM>&gt; thanks to Matthew Peddlesden - but I tried &quot; boot sda1:&quot; or &quot;boot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sda1:/vmlinux root=/dev/sda1&quot; but MILO will not load the ext2-fs:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MILO: unknown filesystem on device sda1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I partitioned the HDD with ext2 (85)! I'm useing Debian2.1 and I didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; found a usefull introduction for this topic. Please can somebody help?
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm. When I installed Debian onto my machine I found that the only way I
<BR>
could get it to work was to also put all the disk labeling on as well.
<BR>
This is available in the fdisk program by issuing 'b' if I remember, for
<BR>
BSD Disk Labelling.  Use the help to double check that.
<BR>
When I installed, I went through the following procedure:
<BR>
<P>In Fdisk, set up the BSD Disk Label, you need:
<BR>
a: to be your main area
<BR>
b: to be your swap area
<BR>
c: to be your WHOLE disk, ie. it overlaps EVERYTHING, including the first
<BR>
two cylinders that you left.
<BR>
<P>Make sure to start a: a  couple of cylinders in.
<BR>
<P>Set the types up correctly (your main should be type 'ext2' and your swap
<BR>
should be 'swap', the WHOLE disk partition should be left at none.
<BR>
<P>Now comes the fun bit :)  You need to mimick that information in the
<BR>
conventional partitioning, so write the partition table out and then go
<BR>
back into fdisk, and add the partitions in as normal, set up their types
<BR>
and you're ready to go.
<BR>
<P>I did the initial setup of this drive when I was trying to get RedHat 6.0
<BR>
on here, so I'm not sure if/how the debian CFDisk will do it, if at all -
<BR>
but hopefully there's a copy of fdisk somewhere on the install set that
<BR>
you can use if it doesn't, or someone else can slap me around and say
<BR>
'oooh my lordy! what a silly way to do it!' hehehehe :)
<BR>
<P>Make the swap and the filesystem and from then Milo should be happy.  The
<BR>
tricky bit is getting the above two steps right and matched together - if
<BR>
they don't match it won't complain, but you might get some bizarre things
<BR>
happening later on.
<BR>
<P>Let me know how you get on :)
<BR>
<P>Matthew Peddlesden.
