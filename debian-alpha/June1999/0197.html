Hi...
<BR>
<P>I just realised that there are quite a few perl-based packages
<BR>
(libapache-mod-perl, libapache-asp-perl, many more) that install files to
<BR>
an architecture-dependent path (ie. /usr/lib/perl5/i386-linux/5.004/).
<BR>
Obviously, this is less than optimal for other archs (I'm on Alpha, but
<BR>
I'm sure this can be a problem for PPC, m68k, sparc, etc).  I ran into
<BR>
this problem when trying to get a few mod-perl-based apache packages
<BR>
working on my new Alpha, only to realise that it wasn't finding things
<BR>
properly.  On subsequent checking, I found ALOT of perl code in
<BR>
/usr/lib/perl5/i386-linux/ that probably should've been stored in
<BR>
/usr/lib/perl5/alpha-linux.
<BR>
<P>Could the maintainers of all arch-independent perl-based packages check to
<BR>
see where your debs are placing files on installation?  A simple grep on
<BR>
the source package will not work, however, since most Makefile.PL's fill
<BR>
in that info when they configure themselves, so you'll have to either
<BR>
check master's copy of the debs or build a new one and check with 'dpkg
<BR>
-c'.  This will save me ALOT of work filing bug reports and figuring out
<BR>
what packages are doing this (there are at least five from what I can tell
<BR>
so far).
<BR>
