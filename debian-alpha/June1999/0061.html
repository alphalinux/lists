</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when I tried to boot right from the floopy it still gave me the same

<EM>&gt; drive it would lock the machine hard. Has anyone have a similar problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and found a solution? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Out of curiosity, have you recompiled your kernel to support the new card?
<BR>
I know, dumb question, but I've forgotten such details in the past
<BR>
(blush).  Also, I've heard of oddities when running more than one SCSI
<BR>
card in Alphas when more than one manufacturer is involved.  Any way of
<BR>
adding your old drive to the chain with the new one on the new card and
<BR>
just omitting the ncr support from the kernel?
<BR>
<P>Oh, also a good thing to do is get MILO and ARC to display the installed
<BR>
devices (ARC has a menu item and MILO should take a 'show' and display
<BR>
things).  Make sure both are reporting ok.
<BR>
<P>BTW, do you have 32- and 64-bit PCI slots in your AS1000?  If so, make
<BR>
sure you put the new card into a 64-bit slot since I've heard of past
<BR>
problems with 32-bit PCI slots and linux in some of the AS models.
<BR>
<P>Lastly, read through the Adaptec driver source a bit and make sure that
<BR>
you don't need any special parameters passed through the boot command
<BR>
line.
<BR>
<P>Let me know what you find out...
