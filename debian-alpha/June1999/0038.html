Hi...
<BR>
<P>Well, PostgreSQL does, in fact, work when compiled without optimisations.
<BR>
That's the good news.  I can post a regression report if needed.
<BR>
<P>Bad news is that something happens during packaging that prevents it from
<BR>
working.  I would love to guess the wrapper, but I don't think that's the
<BR>
case anymore.  I believe the fault is in the procedure to make it conform
<BR>
to the FSSTD.  I did notice quite a few errors during packaging, but
<BR>
didn't think much of them since they occurred in the secondary packages
<BR>
(Perl support, etc).
<BR>
<P>Basically, we can do one of many things here.  I'm tempted to file a bug
<BR>
against the package, BUT there is a new version on the horizon (slated for
<BR>
7 July, if I remember correct).  Plus, nailing this one down could be VERY
<BR>
tough since I'm not sure why it's dying in the first place on the packaged
<BR>
version.  If I had to take a guess, I would say that it somehow
<BR>
misinstalls the templates for new db's, thereby forcing postmaster to
<BR>
exceed some memory bounds looking through/for a corrupted template.
<BR>
<P>Either way, if anyone NEEDS postgresql for the time being, I highly
<BR>
recommend hand-building it and install it in /usr/local or something until
<BR>
we get this worked out.
<BR>
<P>In the meantime, I'll bug the maintainer to see what he thinks of the
<BR>
situation.  If he can help us get this resolved somehow, someone should
<BR>
send him some beer :-)
<BR>
<P>C
<BR>
<P>PS to Bart: I guess this means that we can use pgsql after all to work on
<BR>
that organisation that we've been chatting about.  It will take a bit more
<BR>
work, but I'd be happy to send you some patches so you can build this
<BR>
easily.
