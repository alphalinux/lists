<P>Very true, which is the case with arch-dependent perl-based packages.  I'm
<BR>
referring to the arch-indep packages.  I've backtracked a bit and noticed
<BR>
that most of them just store .packlist's there (no big deal), but there
<BR>
are a few (libapache-asp-perl comes to mind) which stores other things
<BR>
into /usr/lib/perl5/i386-linux/*.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now, if what you are saying is that a binary Perl module that was built
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for Alpha puts code into i386-linux, then that is obviously wrong.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, those are correct in every case that I've seen thus far.
