Hello,
<BR>
<P>Some of us have discussed better coordination of the Alpha project.
<BR>
There are people working on a database of packages and who is
<BR>
generally responsible for them.
<BR>
<P>My part comes in with helping to coordinate the building of packages.
<BR>
This is done by wanna-build, the software that also interacts with the 
<BR>
Alpha autocompiler on my machine, erwin.complete.org.
<BR>
<P>First, you need to be aware of the website for this:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.complete.org/~buildd/">http://www.complete.org/~buildd/</A>
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From this site, you may get the status of every package in our
</EM><BR>
distribution.  You may see which packages haven't build (this is a
<BR>
good place to invest some energy working on), which ones have been
<BR>
built and uploaded but are pending a dinstall run, which ones people
<BR>
are working on building, complete build logs from any package the
<BR>
autobuilder worked on, and which packages need to be built (another
<BR>
place to invest energy).
<BR>
<P>For those of you that build packages for Alpha, just drop me an e-mail 
<BR>
and I'll add you to the list of authorized people for
<BR>
wanna-build@complete.org.  With this address, you inform the system of 
<BR>
the packages which you are going to build, their status, any failures, 
<BR>
and when they are uploaded.  In this way, we eliminate duplicated
<BR>
effort (since we can see at a glance when a package is being built).
<BR>
Furthermore, the autobuilder understands these requests as well, and
<BR>
won't try to build a package that someone else is working on, so we
<BR>
get coordination in that respect also.
<BR>
<P>Finally, there is a list: alpha-changes@complete.org that will carry
<BR>
automated notifications from the wanna-build system when status
<BR>
changes.  For instance, when there are new packages available to try,
<BR>
when a package's status changes from &quot;builing&quot; to &quot;failed&quot;, etc.  It's 
<BR>
a Listar list, so you can use Listar, Majordomo, or Smartlist syntax
<BR>
to subscribe or use the Web front-end at
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.complete.org/cgi-bin/listargate.cgi">http://www.complete.org/cgi-bin/listargate.cgi</A>
<BR>
<P>I'm currently working on a CGI script that will allow you to instantly 
<BR>
query the status of any package in the distribution.  Also in the
<BR>
pipes is a way to get our patch repository online.  Already, there is
<BR>
a patch area (the autobuilder will automatically apply these as
<BR>
appropriate).  I hope to have these improvements made by tonight.
<BR>
