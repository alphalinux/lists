Hi!
<BR>
<P>How stable is woody/alpha right now?
<BR>
<P>I tried it on my PWS about 6 months ago but it was horrible 
<BR>
unstable then! And besides, there was no KDE2 or Mozilla.
<BR>
I then tried Redhat 7.0 and FreeBSD 4.3 and they were 
<BR>
extremly unstable as well! (Actually I think it was XFree86 
<BR>
that caused 99% of the problems). Then I tried SuSE 7.1RC 
<BR>
and I'm still running it and I've found it to be very 
<BR>
stable! I've had a few X-freezes but nothing compared to 
<BR>
Debian/Redhat/FreeBSD.
<BR>
How much better has Debian Woody/Alpha become the last 6 
<BR>
months? I *really* like Debian, I use it on ALL of my other 
<BR>
boxes (10 or so) and it's the most stable distro of them 
<BR>
all on Intel! Is it worth spending a night reinstalling my 
<BR>
Alpha?
<BR>
<P>Also, has anyone gotten LVM and ReiserFS to work together 
<BR>
on Alpha? I can't get Alpha LVM to work on 2.4.x (vgchange 
<BR>
segfaults) but it's working in 2.2.19. And I can't get 
<BR>
ReiserFS to work on 2.2.19 but it's working in 2.4.x... 
<BR>
I've tried both releases and CVS-snapshots.
<BR>
