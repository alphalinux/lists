<P>I disagree.  I've been running 2.4 kernels exclusively for months now on
<BR>
all of my Alphas.  Aside from the SMP patch that I need to submit to the
<BR>
kernel folks, and a few other very minor things, I haven't had any
<BR>
big problems with 2.4 at all.  In fact, 2.2.17-19 may have a scheduler
<BR>
&quot;buglet&quot; on SMP systems that I've been looking into in the past few
<BR>
weeks.  It only would really affect EV67's and above, but so far, it's
<BR>
been hard to figure out just how performance is impacted.  The buglet may
<BR>
actually be helping performance, believe it or not :-P  I've also found a
<BR>
few other issues with 2.2.x kernels, but they're more driver-related
<BR>
than anything else.
<BR>
<P>XFree86 4.0.x is also MUCH better on my alphas than prior
<BR>
versions.  Granted, S3ViRGE support sucks (it does on all archs,
<BR>
actually), but the V3, Millenium I, and Permedia2 are all running quite
<BR>
well with the newer XFree versions.  I'm still working on getting 4.1.0's
<BR>
tdfx driver with DRI to not sack out my machine, but that may be a problem
<BR>
with my libglide3-alpha package (which I maintain).
