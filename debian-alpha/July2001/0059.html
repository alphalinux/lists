<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I tried it on my PWS about 6 months ago but it was 
</EM><BR>
horrible 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; unstable then!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How so?
</EM><BR>
<P>Lots of random lockups... Most of the time it was X that 
<BR>
locked up, but sometimes it just stopped responding 
<BR>
completly. Sometimes the keyboard died even *before* I 
<BR>
started X. Sometimes the network just stopped working and 
<BR>
even if I did &quot;ifconfig eth0 down&quot; and lsmod showed that 
<BR>
zero &quot;things&quot; were using de4x5 (or whatever the name of the 
<BR>
modules is - can't remember), &quot;rmmod de4x5&quot; said &quot;device 
<BR>
busy&quot;...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Just out of curiosity, why is having KDE so all-important 
</EM><BR>
to people?  I
<BR>
<EM>&gt; mean, I've seen more people want to change distributions 
</EM><BR>
just to get KDE,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; which I just don't understand.  I'm just curious...seems 
</EM><BR>
a bit odd to me.
<BR>
<P>Because KDE is simply wonderful! I've been a GNOME biggot 
<BR>
and a WindowMaker biggot and a XFWM biggot, but after the 
<BR>
2.0 series got stable (2.1.2) I am in love with it! I'm 
<BR>
running the 2.2beta right now and it's simply amazingly 
<BR>
good AND stable!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So X was the stumbling block for woody when you tried 
</EM><BR>
it?  What WM and apps froze most often?  Also, were these 
<BR>
freezes locking up the computer totally, or just locking up 
<BR>
X?
<BR>
<P>Most of the time it just locked up X, but when i sshed to 
<BR>
it and killed X, the screen were still there although ps -
<BR>
ef showed no signs of X-processes and it was impossible to 
<BR>
start X again...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Is it worth spending a night reinstalling my Alpha?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's up to you.  I haven't really played much with SuSE, 
</EM><BR>
but it seems like a good distribution.  If it's stable 
<BR>
doing what you do with your Alpha, then I wouldn't 
<BR>
recommend changing it too much (especially if you have to 
<BR>
do real work on your machine, like I do...reinstallation is 
<BR>
NOT an option for me because too many things may change).  
<BR>
If, however, it's a fun box, then do what you 
<BR>
like...install Debian, leave SuSE on, whatever...it's your 
<BR>
preference :-)
<BR>
<P>It's something in between a funbox and a workbox... It's my 
<BR>
home workstation and I depend on it to read my mail (when 
<BR>
I'm not at work like now), surf, play my ogg/mp3-music and 
<BR>
so on... Nothing really serious, but I still want it to be 
<BR>
stable!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One question back to you: if you saw all of these 
</EM><BR>
problems, did you file bug reports?  It is *REALLY* 
<BR>
difficult to fix things if we don't know that they are 
<BR>
broken. User feedback is critical.
<BR>
<P>Yes, I did, when I could reproduce it...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ReiserFS is much better in 2.4.x on Alpha.  I've got an 
</EM><BR>
i386 at home with a ReiserFS volume and have been toying 
<BR>
with doing the same on Alpha.  It seems that some of the 
<BR>
patches that went in to 2.4.x haven't made it to the 2.2.x 
<BR>
kernels (and may never make it since 2.2.20 may be the end 
<BR>
of the 2.2 line).  As for LVM, can you detail the 
<BR>
experiences with it?  I may be able to debug it if I can 
<BR>
reproduce the problems.   I've never tried it, personally, 
<BR>
but was intending on doing so.
<BR>
<P>I tested LVM on 2.4.5, 2.4.6pre9 and 2.4.5ac22. All of them 
<BR>
both with and without the latest CVS-snapshot of the LVM-
<BR>
patches.
<BR>
I use two disks, one 48GB and one 30GB. They used to sit in 
<BR>
my PC. It has 2x30GB striped, one 8GB and one 10GB LV. The 
<BR>
2x30GB LV is a ReiserFS volume.
<BR>
I decided that I wanted the disks in my Alpha instead so I 
<BR>
removed them from my PC and put them in my Alpha.
<BR>
vgscan find the disks, but when I do &quot;vgchange -a y&quot;, it 
<BR>
segfaults. On plain 2.4.5+CVS-snapshot, vgchange even 
<BR>
crashes the whole kernel and I get thrown out to a SRM-
<BR>
debugger or something like that...
<BR>
After the failed vgchange, I can run vgdisplay and it shows 
<BR>
the right numbers. But if I try to access the LVs I 
<BR>
get &quot;not a valid block device&quot;...
<BR>
Yes, I also tried to recompile the lvm-tools but the same 
<BR>
thing happened.
<BR>
<P>Using LVM for 2.2.19 it works just fine. 
<BR>
I can use the LVs just like on the PC. But it seems 
<BR>
impossible to make ReiserFS work on 2.2.19/Alpha so I STILL 
<BR>
can't access the 2x30GB LV... :(
<BR>
<P><P>Regards
<BR>
