<EM>&gt; Oh, I believe it. Red-Hat compiles of mozilla run fine though.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; After installing, run once as root, and it will run for user accounts.
</EM><BR>
<P>RH 6.x still used egcs 1.1.2, IIRC.  While this version of the compiler is
<BR>
still broken WRT multiple-inheritence C++, it's not nearly as bad as gcc
<BR>
2.95.x has been.  RH 7.x uses gcc &quot;2.96&quot;, which has most of the patches
<BR>
included that are needed to get C++ code compiling correctly.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've also been trying to compile mozilla with g++-3.0 and -O3 and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 5 DAYS later it is still compiling.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hehehe...only takes an hour or two on my UP2k at work :-P  I'll have to try
<BR>
again with the more recent CVS snapshots (haven't done so yet).  I'm hoping
<BR>
to get a good package uploaded sooner or later.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Numerous problems exist, like mangled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; function names are different (fixed that by editing the genstubs.pl) and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problems linking with the accessibility functions (fixed that by just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; making them return an error).
</EM><BR>
<P>Can you send me a patch for the mangling fixes?  I was going to do this
<BR>
exact procedure, but just haven't gotten to it yet (been busy porting
<BR>
drivers and things to 2.4 kernels).  I wouldn't mind getting a peek at what
<BR>
you did with the accessibility stuff as well, although I'll probably fix it
<BR>
rather than just returning an error (if possible).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; On installing the deb package, registering components gives a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; segfault on my box. It's been doing that for months, and I strongly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe it's the compiler's fault.
</EM><BR>
<P>It definitely is.  I went through several hours of debugging that and
<BR>
arrived at the same conclusion pointed out by a fellow list-member: it's
<BR>
definitely the compiler.  Seems that the CTORS and DTORS lists weren't being
<BR>
set up properly, so when the exit functions were run and the binary tried to
<BR>
call the destructors, it jumped immediately to the gp for the programme
<BR>
itself (rather than iterating through the respective destructors).  For
<BR>
simple C++ code, things work ok, but anything with multiple inheritence, it
<BR>
obviously breaks.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Lots of luck...
</EM><BR>
<P>Hehehehe...thanks!
