<P>Kernel-version:  I have had good luck with the 2.2.19 kernel here, but I
<BR>
have a different ALPHA machine so your milage may vary.  I have NOT
<BR>
tried any of the 2.4.X series kernels so I can't comment except to say
<BR>
there seems to have been several messages on the trials/tribulations of
<BR>
getting them to work on a ALPHA.
<BR>
<P>Web-Browser:  This is a personal problem I have been struggling with
<BR>
here for quite a while.  There is a RPM version of Netscape avalilabe
<BR>
from COMPAQ that you can install to Debian Potato using the &quot;alien&quot;
<BR>
program.  I have done this here, but it seemed to be a bit &quot;flakey&quot;, and
<BR>
would only provide useful browsing on Debian &quot;Potato&quot; for the ALPHA. 
<BR>
When I upgraded to Debian &quot;testing' or &quot;unstable&quot; it seriously breaks.
<BR>
<P>I have also tried the &quot;Mozilla&quot; packages.  The versions that comes with
<BR>
Potato and/or Testing version of Debian-Alpha are rather old and lack a
<BR>
lot of features.  There IS a newer version in &quot;Unstable&quot; (version
<BR>
0.9.1-4) that is quite use-able on Intel Arch machines BUT I have had a
<BR>
dickens of a time getting it running on my ALPHA.  I have tried
<BR>
installing the binaries, and also d/l the source and building my own
<BR>
debs, but either way it bombs out on the mozilla-browser.postinst script
<BR>
leaving that package unconfigured and only partially installed.  Since
<BR>
the rest of the Mozilla packages depend upon this package being
<BR>
installed, they bomb-out too.  This is quite mysterious to me because
<BR>
the EXACT same version with the same &quot;mozilla-browser.postinst&quot; script
<BR>
installs on Intel-Arch machines just fine!  This obviously is an ALPHA
<BR>
problem, but I can't figure out where.  I am going to do a separate post
<BR>
for &quot;help&quot; here on this issue when I collect some more data/info about
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P>Finally, KDE comes with a nice browser (Konqueror) but unfortunately KDE
<BR>
is not quite yet available for the ALPHA arch.  There was an
<BR>
announcement just this week that it was finally compiling on the ALPHA
<BR>
using gcc 3.0, and it is looking better for it to be in Woody when that
<BR>
distro is released.  I would suspect we will be seeing it available in
<BR>
&quot;unstable&quot; real soon.  I am anxiously awaiting / anticipating it's
<BR>
appearance!!
<BR>
<P>Hope this Info Helps
<BR>
