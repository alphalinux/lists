<P><EM>&gt; How stable is woody/alpha right now?
</EM><BR>
<P>Dunno...I'm running unstable by necessity :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I tried it on my PWS about 6 months ago but it was horrible 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unstable then!
</EM><BR>
<P>How so?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And besides, there was no KDE2 or Mozilla.
</EM><BR>
<P>That may still end up being the case.  While we have the core KDE stuff
<BR>
compiled, things like KOffice, etc, remain uncompilable.  I wish woody's
<BR>
freeze wasn't on top of us now or else I'd make gcc-3.0 our default
<BR>
compiler (gcc 2.95.4 is broken for C++, hence mozilla and KDE wouldn't
<BR>
compile properly before).
<BR>
<P>Just out of curiosity, why is having KDE so all-important to people?  I
<BR>
mean, I've seen more people want to change distributions just to get KDE,
<BR>
which I just don't understand.  I'm just curious...seems a bit odd to me.
<BR>
<P>The KDE bits in unstable are compiled with gcc-3.0/g++-3.0 and even they
<BR>
needed patching.  I'm working with the maintainer of the core KDE stuff on
<BR>
this (Ivan), but he knows more about the state of the package for Alpha
<BR>
than I do (I'm just a compiler and debugging monkey for this
<BR>
one).  Mozilla falls into the same C++ hole as KDE, except that the
<BR>
mozilla folks haven't gotten around to making the code compile happily
<BR>
with new gcc versions (they hard-code some demangling, etc, which is not
<BR>
good).  Once/If I can get it to compile properly, I'll upload it and try
<BR>
to get it into woody.  Ah, hell, just realised that mozilla-cvs is non-US,
<BR>
so I can't do that.  But I *can* make a patch and post it :-P  I'll try
<BR>
that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I then tried Redhat 7.0 and FreeBSD 4.3 and they were 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extremly unstable as well! (Actually I think it was XFree86 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that caused 99% of the problems). Then I tried SuSE 7.1RC 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I'm still running it and I've found it to be very 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stable! I've had a few X-freezes but nothing compared to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Debian/Redhat/FreeBSD.
</EM><BR>
<P>So X was the stumbling block for woody when you tried it?  What WM and
<BR>
apps froze most often?  Also, were these freezes locking up the computer
<BR>
totally, or just locking up X?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How much better has Debian Woody/Alpha become the last 6 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; months? I *really* like Debian, I use it on ALL of my other 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boxes (10 or so) and it's the most stable distro of them 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all on Intel! Is it worth spending a night reinstalling my 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha?
</EM><BR>
<P>It's up to you.  I haven't really played much with SuSE, but it seems like
<BR>
a good distribution.  If it's stable doing what you do with your Alpha,
<BR>
then I wouldn't recommend changing it too much (especially if you have to
<BR>
do real work on your machine, like I do...reinstallation is NOT an option
<BR>
for me because too many things may change).  If, however, it's a fun box,
<BR>
then do what you like...install Debian, leave SuSE on, whatever...it's
<BR>
your preference :-)
<BR>
<P>One question back to you: if you saw all of these problems, did you file
<BR>
bug reports?  It is *REALLY* difficult to fix things if we don't know that
<BR>
they are broken. User feedback is critical.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Also, has anyone gotten LVM and ReiserFS to work together 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on Alpha? I can't get Alpha LVM to work on 2.4.x (vgchange 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; segfaults) but it's working in 2.2.19. And I can't get 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ReiserFS to work on 2.2.19 but it's working in 2.4.x... 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've tried both releases and CVS-snapshots.
</EM><BR>
<P>ReiserFS is much better in 2.4.x on Alpha.  I've got an i386 at home with
<BR>
a ReiserFS volume and have been toying with doing the same on Alpha.  It
<BR>
seems that some of the patches that went in to 2.4.x haven't made it to
<BR>
the 2.2.x kernels (and may never make it since 2.2.20 may be the end of
<BR>
the 2.2 line).  As for LVM, can you detail the experiences with it?  I may
<BR>
be able to debug it if I can reproduce the problems.   I've never tried
<BR>
it, personally, but was intending on doing so.
<BR>
