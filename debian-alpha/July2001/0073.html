<P>
I've tried FreeBSD on my Alpha. It also has these lockups. 
<BR>
It's mostly XFree86 (both v4 and v3) that freezes, but I've 
<BR>
had freezes in FreeBSD (4.3RELEASE and 5.0CURRENT from 
<BR>
200103-something) even without running X, and that has NOT 
<BR>
yet happened on Linux 2.2.19 (it has on 2.4.x though)...
<BR>
<P>The biggest problem with FreeBSD/Alpha though is that the 
<BR>
ports-collection is still very x86-ish. About 30% of the 
<BR>
ports fails to compile on Alpha... I've reported a LOT of 
<BR>
compilefailures, but since 99% of the FreeBSDers seems to 
<BR>
be running x86, most ports mainainers either don't care or 
<BR>
don't know how to fix it.
<BR>
<P>Then, I have also managed to make Tru64 5.1 crash by 
<BR>
running graphicsintensive (like avifile/mplayer)-apps from 
<BR>
a remote x86 Linuxbox and by running buggy Open3D apps...

<P><P>Don't get me wrong, I love debian, but I absolutely hate in 
<BR>
on my Alpha
<BR>
For that matter I hate any linux on my alpha, the all lock 
<BR>
up for some
<BR>
odd reason but I can run BSD on them with out a problem, 
<BR>
it's a sx164 I
<BR>
loaded it with redhat 5.2 like 4 or 5 years ago and that 
<BR>
was the only
<BR>
one that actually ran stable on my machine!!!  If you're 
<BR>
havin that much
<BR>
trouble give BSD a try and load bash up as the shell and it 
<BR>
will make it
<BR>
seem like you are using a Linux machine thanks to ports, No 
<BR>
joke
