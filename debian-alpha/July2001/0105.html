<P>
I have been playing around with Mozilla-9.1 from the Alpha &quot;unstable&quot;
<BR>
tree and have got it working somewhat.  The problem I now have is the
<BR>
java2-plugin that it wants to install.  
<BR>
<P>On my first attempt I tried to install it using the &quot;smartupdate&quot;
<BR>
feature from the Netscape site.  This was a bad move in that THAT
<BR>
java2-plugin was for the i386 arch. and wouldn't work with my Alpha.
<BR>
<P>The second &quot;try&quot; was to install the JDK 1.3.1 kit from Compaq.  As far
<BR>
as I know, this installation went fine...no errors reported during
<BR>
install and I can fire up the various components.  According to the docs
<BR>
I have been able to find, the JDK 1.3.1 contains the JRE, and the JRE is
<BR>
supposed to come with a Netscape 6 &quot;java2-plugin&quot;.  On my i386 machines
<BR>
it is there and is called &quot;libjavaplugin_oji.so&quot;.  I cannot find
<BR>
anything similar in the COMPAQ JDK 1.3.1 kit.  The nearest thing is
<BR>
called &quot;libjava.so&quot;.  All the other components I see on my i386 machines
<BR>
seems to be available in the JRE section of the JDK.  All I am missing
<BR>
is the java2 plugin.
<BR>
<P>The question is: where can I find the ALPHA equivalent of
<BR>
&quot;libjavaplugin_oji.so&quot;??  Does it even exist and/or is there a
<BR>
&quot;substitute&quot;.
<BR>
<P>As you can tell, I am NOT a programmer nor do I know much about JAVA.  I
<BR>
don't think it is feasible for me to make this plugin, so I am quite
<BR>
dependent upon others for some help here.
<BR>
<P>TIA &amp; Cheers,
<BR>
