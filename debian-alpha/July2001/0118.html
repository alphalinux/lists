<P>
Donald,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This worked too.  The ONLY hitch was that the cpml
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installer warned me thatI had a EV-6 processor and was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trying to install the EV-5 cpml packge. The COMPAQ
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  webpages state I have a EV-5 CPU. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure wether your machine is a EV5 or 6, but the
<BR>
EV5 packages work on both. The difference is that the
<BR>
EV6 packages are optimized for EV6. No harm can come
<BR>
from using the EV5 packages, even on a EV6 processor.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now for the question.  Is there any reason that the deb installers in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;testing&quot; or &quot;unstable&quot; shouldn't be used for installing these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; packages?  It seemed a bit easier, and is definately &quot;cleaner&quot; not to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a bunch of RPM stuff scattered around the system.
</EM><BR>
<P>I suppose this comes down to a question of personal preferences.
<BR>
<P>Personaly, I would go with the once shipped with Debian. It's
<BR>
highly likely that they have had the necesarry work-arounds built
<BR>
in to them, and that they therefore are eiser to install, integrates better
<BR>
with the rest of the system, and makes it easy to upgrade them as you
<BR>
upgrade the rest of your system.
<BR>
<P>The downside would be if you decide to go with the stable release
<BR>
(once Woody is resleased), they want be the latest and greates for
<BR>
very long. That might not make such a big difference though, unlesss
<BR>
you find some features in never versions that you absolutly need, or it
<BR>
goes from beta to stable (in which case it will probably be utabed in
<BR>
stable as well anyway).
<BR>
<P>Now that Compaq has declared Alpha EOL, it will be interesting
<BR>
to see how much more work they will put into their C, C++ and Java
<BR>
efforts for Linux/Alpha. It wouldn't surprise me if those projects would
<BR>
loose support very soon when they start pulling people over to porting
<BR>
True64, OpenVMS and the rest to IA64.
