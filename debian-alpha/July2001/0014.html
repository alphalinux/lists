<P>
Is there a Java kit for the Alpha...Either an SDK or Run-Time
<BR>
environment?  
<BR>
I know about the beta 1.3.1 kit from Compaq...are there any other
<BR>
options?  
<BR>
Does anyone have any comments on using the beta Compaq Java SDK under
<BR>
Debian Linux for the Alpha?  (I am assume that it is in RPM format and
<BR>
will need to be converted using alien.) 
<BR>
<P>The reason for the questions is that after getting Mozilla 0.9.1 running
<BR>
on my Alpha, the second site I visited (my Bank) required it to install
<BR>
a Java 2 plugin and sent me to the Netscape ftp site.  It did it's
<BR>
&quot;smart download&quot; and installed the plugin then promptly froze up
<BR>
Mozilla!  All I could get is a Netscape error message reading something
<BR>
like &quot;The program must close to complete a previous installation. 
<BR>
Please restart the application.&quot;.  The only way I could figure out to
<BR>
recover was to re-install Mozilla...not especially an easy process for
<BR>
me.  Upon back-tracking what was done by the &quot;smart download&quot; I
<BR>
discovered that the plugin came from the i386 &quot;tree&quot;.  I suspect THAT is
<BR>
the problem...the plugin is not compiled for the Alpha...dunno.  There
<BR>
doesn't seem to be any Source code available at the sites I have
<BR>
visited, and I can't find any JAVA stuff for the Alpha, except at the
<BR>
Compaq site.  I am hoping that by installing a JRE-2 for the Alpha I can
<BR>
bypass this &quot;smart download&quot; step and still be able to vist the sites
<BR>
that require it.   
<BR>
<P>Any help/suggestions would be appreciated.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
