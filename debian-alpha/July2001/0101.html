Hi Paul,
<BR>
<P>Thanks a lot for the info. BTW, I received a message from
<BR>
Seagate about tape compression and some technical info on my DDS-2
<BR>
tape drive, more especifically for CTD8000R-S. I think that is worthy
<BR>
to post it here.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Luiz:
<BR>
<P>Here is everything I could find on compression. I hope this helps you.
<BR>
<P>When using compression, if the drive looks for a series of data and
<BR>
assigns it symbol or &quot;token&quot;. Instead of writing the entire series of
<BR>
data, only the token is written to tape, somewhat like taking shorthand.
<BR>
When the same series of data is found repeatedly within a file,
<BR>
substituting a token for each occurrance greatly reduces the amount of
<BR>
data that must be written to tape. In order to restore the data later, a
<BR>
legend of what each token represents is also written to tape.
<BR>
<P>If the drive encounters files that have already been compressed, new
<BR>
tokens are assigned, causing the token legend to grow in size. At the same
<BR>
time, files that are already compressed cannot be compressed further.
<BR>
Since the legend continues to grow in size, it is possible that a
<BR>
compressed backup could take up more space on tape than if no compression
<BR>
were used.
<BR>
<P>To see this happen, run a backup without using compression. You should get
<BR>
approximately the native capacity of the drive on the tape before it is
<BR>
full. Then you can run a backup using only software compression. If you
<BR>
are able to backup any amount above the native capacity of the drive, then
<BR>
your data is being compressed.
<BR>
<P>According to Seagate Technology engineers hardware compression
<BR>
is generally better, however, in some instances software
<BR>
compression works better. This of course depends on by &quot;better&quot; you mean
<BR>
faster, or save more space. certain types of files do not
<BR>
compress because they are already compressed like .jpg, .wav, etc.
<BR>
<P>We feel that the only way to determine which is best for you
<BR>
is to try both.
<BR>
<P>If by &quot;better&quot;, you mean more reliable, both compression schemes
<BR>
are equally reliable.
<BR>
<P>Hardware compression is at a hardware level.  You can not view compression
<BR>
results in the backup report. To verify hardware compression download and
<BR>
run TDiag from Seagate's web site.
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.seagate.com/support/tape/utils/index.html">http://www.seagate.com/support/tape/utils/index.html</A>
<BR>
<P>Another way to verify hardware compression is to select a backup greater
<BR>
than the native capacity of the tape.
<BR>
Click Tools, Media, and Identify.  Note the capacity of the tape.
<BR>
Create a backup Job with files selected greater than the identified
<BR>
capacity of the tape.
<BR>
If the backup completes without prompting the user for a second tape then
<BR>
the drive is hardware compressing.
<BR>
<P>If you would prefer to use software compression, the backup report will
<BR>
give you accurate compression results.
<BR>
<P>If this is, the external DAT, the model no., indicates it is,  the
<BR>
external case will need to be opened.
<BR>
<P>Turn off the PC:
<BR>
<P>With Tape Drives External Case Open:
<BR>
1)  On the jumper block, pins 9 and 10 will need to be jumpered.
<BR>
This site has a picture of the jumper block.
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.seagate.com/support/tape/scsiide/gif/sc24_blk.gif">http://www.seagate.com/support/tape/scsiide/gif/sc24_blk.gif</A>
<BR>
<P>2) On the Dip Switches, Switch 6 needs to be set to ON.
<BR>
This disables Data Compression.  This site explains that.
<BR>
<P>3)  Restart the PC.
<BR>
While doing a backup the Progress Box will no longer say Hardware
<BR>
Compression while backing up.  When the backup is complete your report
<BR>
will give you an accurate account of the backup before and after
<BR>
compression.
<BR>
<P>Use our DOS diagnostic and do a 7 gb backup.
<BR>
This program uses its own data to do a compression check.
<BR>
<P>Perform a read/write test with compression check.
<BR>
<P>use the -c switch after the sgtape21.exe file and it will generate its own
<BR>
data, which is very compressible.
<BR>
<P>Here is the EXACT syntax to type:
<BR>
<P>a:\sgtape21.exe -c
<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TEST THE TAPE DRIVE IN DOS
<BR>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<BR>
<P>You can test the drive functionality at a DOS level with our
<BR>
diagnostic. If the drive cannot operate in DOS it will not
<BR>
operate in Windows
<BR>
<P>sgtape21.exe
<BR>
is our diagnostic and it is attached to this document
<BR>
<P>In Windows - TO SAVE DIAGNOSTIC FILE TO YOUR HARD DRIVE
<BR>
<P>1. Double Click the DIAGNOSTIC ICON in your email.
<BR>
2. Click on DETACH.
<BR>
3. Keep track of where you SAVE it to.
<BR>
<P>In Windows - TO UNPACK THE DIAGNOSTIC FILE TO A FLOPPY DISK
<BR>
<P>1. Insert a BLANK FLOPPY DISK in your FLOPPY DRIVE.
<BR>
2. Double Click the diagnostic ICON
<BR>
3. Type     A:      in the &quot;unzip to folder box&quot;
<BR>
4. Click UNZIP
<BR>
5. The ICON will unzip into files on the floppy disk.
<BR>
<P>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DIAGNOSTIC MUST BE RUN IN 'TRUE' DOS
<BR>
<P>The best way to run this DIAGNOSTIC is to boot into DOS
<BR>
with a START-UP DISK from Windows 98.
<BR>
<P>THIS DIAGNOSTIC WILL ERASE ANY DATA ON THE TAPE
<BR>
do not use a tape that has data that you will need to
<BR>
restore later.
<BR>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<BR>
<P>To boot into DOS
<BR>
<P>1. Insert your Start-up Diskette in the Disk Drive.
<BR>
2. RESTART your Computer.
<BR>
3. Say YES to CD-rom support ... this loads the ASPI drivers
<BR>
4. Your computer will end up BOOTED into DOS at the     a:\&gt;
<BR>
5. Insert the floppy disk with the DIAGNOSTIC on it
<BR>
<P>===================================================================
<BR>
SCSI TAPE DRIVES require an ASPI driver in DOS ...
<BR>
The Windows 98 boot disk loads the &quot;most common&quot; ASPI drivers
<BR>
If your SCSI devices are not detected, please check with your
<BR>
SCSI controller manufacturer for the correct ASPI drivers.

DO NOT use a tape which contains data you may need to retrieve later

You must perform the Read &amp; Write test.
<BR>
<P>Follow the prompts on the screen after selecting the Read &amp; Write test.
<BR>
<P>If the test completes without errors, the SGTAPE utility will report
<BR>
the drive is functioning correctly.
<BR>
<P>This points to your Computer of Operating System malfunctioning
<BR>
<P>If problems are encountered, note the text of the error message
<BR>
and follow the utility's recommendations before repeating the test.
<BR>
<P>If drive passes the test at DOS go back to windows and test the drive

with your windows software.

THE DRIVE STILL FAILS
<BR>
<P>you can contact Seagate Customer Service at 1-800-468-3472

<EM>&gt; &gt; As far as I know, compression would mean high density on tape.

<EM>&gt;Your assumption is wrong.

<EM>&gt;The density gives you 4GB, the compression doubles that to 8GB

<EM>&gt; &gt; It seems that the limit of 8GB stated by companies is a fiasco !

<EM>&gt;Well, er, DUH! :-) Same problem with 1GB = 1000&quot;MB&quot; = 1,000,000,000

<EM>&gt;bytes, not 1024 x 1024 x 1024 = 1,073,741,824 which means that the

<EM>&gt; &gt; Has anyone backup more than 4GB of data on DDS-2 tapes successfully ?

<EM>&gt;Backup executables, text, data, ... anything that's not already
