Hi all!
<BR>
<P>I'm back in action after a lightning strike two weeks ago (took out the
<BR>
DSL router which the $#@%* DSL repair guy plugged into the WALL outlet
<BR>
last time he was here rather than back into my surge protector).
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I have good news :-)  I just packaged the glide3-64 branch from
<BR>
the glide sourceforge project and am going to upload it today.  I've also
<BR>
asked Branden to patch the upcoming XFree86 v4.1.0 to enable glide support
<BR>
for the tdfx DRI driver.
<BR>
<P>I tested it all using the current X (recompiled, of course) and the new
<BR>
libglide3-alpha{-dev} packages.  Gears speed doubled as did just about
<BR>
every other test that I could find.
<BR>
<P>In short, if you have a V3, V4, or V5, this should really speed up your
<BR>
OpenGL stuff once it hits the archive :-)
<BR>
<P>In the meantime, I *might* make some deb packages that have been modified
<BR>
in this way, but won't upload them to master since they require source
<BR>
changes (extremely minor, but still).   If I do, I'll probably put them up
<BR>
on klecker and let everyone know that they're there.
<BR>
<P>Not bad for a one week+ outtage :-)
<BR>
<P>C
