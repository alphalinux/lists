Hi,
<BR>
<P>I've just uploaded a new set of Alpha-bootdisks to
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://people.debian.org/~thimo/">http://people.debian.org/~thimo/</A>
<BR>
<P>They are still with a manually made to get around the
<BR>
libm-library-reduction problem (any binutils knowing folks
<BR>
around?). However I succeeded in booting them, installing kernel and
<BR>
drivers. Unfortunately, when I tried to configure the modules I just
<BR>
saw a segfault flashing by being overwritten by dbootstrap again :(
<BR>
Strangely, nothing about this got written to the logs... Anyway,
<BR>
manually inserting the modules worked, configuring the network with
<BR>
DHCP and downloading the packages, too! But even here several
<BR>
segfaults flashed by. At the end I got a window telling me that
<BR>
dbootstrap exited with a return code of 139. Daring as I am I rebooted
<BR>
and had a totally unusable system as /etc/fstab wasn't written...
<BR>
<P>Basically, there is still much to do, but as I have to have my diploma
<BR>
thesis finished in three weeks and still have no useful results, I
<BR>
won't be dealing very much with the disks...
<BR>
<P>Now, all Alpha owners with a bit of C-knowledge should try to debug
<BR>
the stuff because Debian 3.0 wouldn't be that great without
<BR>
Alpha... ;-)
<BR>
<P>CU
