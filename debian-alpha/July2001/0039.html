<P>I have a XL366, which is a bit further off, but still a &quot;kissing cousin&quot;.
<BR>
:) The last time I setup this machine with Debian (potato), this is how I
<BR>
did it:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*) Setup alphaBIOS to boot an operating system off of A: as drive,
<BR>
'\linload.exe' as the file, and the OS path pointing to a valid DOS or FAT
<BR>
partition [0]. Leave OS options blank for now.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*) Inserted a floppy disk into the machine that had linload.exe
<BR>
[1] and the milo image for the XLT [2], and execute the OS setup described
<BR>
above in AlphaBIOS.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*) At the milo prompt, I entered 'boot fd0:vmlinuz root=/dev/fd0
<BR>
load_ramdisk=1', inserted the Debian rescue disk and pressed enter.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*) After a bit the Debian root disk is prompted for, so I inserted
<BR>
that and pressed enter.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*) Now the standard Debian install appears and you are set to go
<BR>
from there.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*) After the install, note that you must have a small DOS or FAT
<BR>
partition on the HD to store linload.exe and your milo image. Then modify
<BR>
the above OS setup in AlphaBIOS to boot from the hard disk instead and put
<BR>
the necessary milo command line (i.e. 'boot sda3:vmlinuz
<BR>
root=/dev/sda3') in the OS options field.
<BR>
<P>Yea, it is not exactly simple or straight forward, but doable. If you have
<BR>
any other questions about the setup or boot on the XL, I will be more than
<BR>
glad to help. TTYL.
<BR>
<P>[0] This can be something of a pain if you don't already have a disk with,
<BR>
say, WinNT on it installed in the Alpha. This requirement can be avoided
<BR>
by upgrading AlphaBIOS to the most recent version (4.66 for the XL366),
<BR>
which will only complain about non-DOS partitions being specified in OS
<BR>
setup, instead of stopping you cold in tracks over them. 
<BR>
<P>[1] Copy linload.exe as named to the floppy, it is included with the
<BR>
Debian disks-alpha files. On a debian mirror this would be in
<BR>
.../debian/dists/potato/main/disks-alpha/current/MILO.
<BR>
<P>[2] Copy the milo for your system from the same place as the linload.exe
<BR>
file is found to the floppy and name it 'milo'. Note also, that the XL266
<BR>
is a different architecture from the XL300/366. The latter uses the 'xlt'
<BR>
milo, while the former uses the 'xl' milo. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS. If you haven't already noticed, I have spent a lot of time
<BR>
with getting Linux to boot on XLTs. They are nice machines, just that
<BR>
AlphaBIOS, with all of its nice GUIs, is often a pain to deal with. :)
