<EM>&gt; Donald,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Does anyone have any comments on using the beta
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Compaq Java SDK under Debian Linux for the Alpha?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (I am assume that it is in RPM format and will need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be converted using alien.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Works fine, at least the JRE part. I haven't tried compiling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything with it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, you have to use alien, but that's no problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; At least not with the packages in question.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are some tricks involved to get libcpml to work. Basically,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I followed an explanation from Thomas Weyergraf on how to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CCC to work on Debian/Alpha, which was my primary goal at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time. The recipe is the same for the JDK tough. I'll give you his whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; post here, pick what you need.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In addition, I installed OpenMotif from MetroLink. There is a link
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to it (IIRC) from Compaq's page with install instructions for the Beta.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Or you could fiddle around MetroLink's pages and see if you find it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It says it will work with Lesstif too, so you might get away with simply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Installing Lesstif from its Debian package.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;--snip--
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks for the info, Idar!
<BR>
<P>As some follow-up, I installed both the Compaq JDK and the C compiler
<BR>
using T. Weyergraf's procedures.  I compiled my FIRST program
<BR>
&lt;grin&gt;...the &quot;Hello World&quot; one...sucessfully.  I am still having
<BR>
problems getting the Java2 JRE to work with Mozilla 9-1, so my original
<BR>
problem remains, but I am closing in on it.  Maybe in a few years I will
<BR>
be smart enough to write my own java-plugin for Mozilla &lt;g&gt;.
<BR>
<P>AFTER I sucessfully installed the Compaq C compiler per Mr. Weyergraf's
<BR>
procedures, I discovered there were some &quot;installer&quot; debs in both ALPHA
<BR>
&quot;testing&quot; and &quot;unstable&quot; for the libots, cpml, and ccc packages.  Being
<BR>
curious, I purged my previous install and re-installed using the deb
<BR>
installers.  This worked too.  The ONLY hitch was that the cpml
<BR>
installer warned me thatI had a EV-6 processor and was trying to install
<BR>
the EV-5 cpml packge. The COMPAQ webpages state I have a EV-5 CPU.  My
<BR>
ALPHA is a XL-300...of the XLT branch of the ALCOR family.  I am pretty
<BR>
sure it is a EV-5.  The &quot;warning&quot; didn't seem to make any
<BR>
difference...yet.
<BR>
<P>Now for the question.  Is there any reason that the deb installers in
<BR>
&quot;testing&quot; or &quot;unstable&quot; shouldn't be used for installing these
<BR>
packages?  It seemed a bit easier, and is definately &quot;cleaner&quot; not to
<BR>
have a bunch of RPM stuff scattered around the system.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
