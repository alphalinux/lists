<EM>&gt;Glad to see that we managed to lure at least one employee from &quot;the big Q&quot;

<P>Yeah, most everybody in the office is running Red Hat.  But I also 
<BR>
have an ancient Mac I want to use as a gateway running Linux, so I 
<BR>
wanted to keep the configs as similar as possible.  Now that I'm past 
<BR>
the initial learning curve, I'm really liking the dpkg tools, and the 
<BR>
fact that most packages you'd want are centrally located.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What kind of problems is it giving you?  Any errors logged?
</EM><BR>
<P>It dies with a segmentation fault immediately upon image activation.

<EM>&gt;Ok... I've ported diald some days ago but forgot to upload it obviously...

<EM>&gt;It's in incoming now. So if you need it,  you can get it.

<P>I grabbed this kit (thanks!) and installed it, but it still dies with 
<BR>
the same error--segmentation fault immediately on starting the 
<BR>
daemon.  In fact, if I just type 'diald' at the command line, it 
<BR>
fails the same way.  My config is nothing special; very similar to 
<BR>
what's in the diald mini-HOWTO.  If I get a chance this weekend, 
<BR>
maybe I'll try to figure out how to compile it debug and take a look.
<BR>
<P>My guess is that it's barfing on something in its config file(s) 
<BR>
(which it shouldn't do) or I've got some sort of library problem. 
<BR>
Though, the package installed without complaint.
<BR>
<P>Thanks again,
<BR>
