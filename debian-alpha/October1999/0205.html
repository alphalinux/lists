<P>
* Andrew D Lenharth (adl@cs.washington.edu) [991028 23:00]:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I have had the same problem on a multia (noname).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ls was giving the same problem (Illegal instruction), but that has gone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; away.
</EM><BR>
<P>Do you remember what you did to make it go away ?
<BR>
<P>I don't want to reboot the box as long as I don't know that it will come up
<BR>
again, since it is also the endpoint of my leased line. (Yeah I know
<BR>
running unstable on such a box is stupid, but well :-)
<BR>
<P>THis morning I simply put the broken libc6.1 on hold and tried an update again.
<BR>
Before the update of the libc6.1 would fail with segfaults.
<BR>
Here first the update of ldso fails with an Illegal instruction, then
<BR>
installs correctly as it seems.
