<P>
Hey again...
<BR>
<P>I know this is ugly, but I think we're going to have to make sure that
<BR>
Alpha's glibc is NOT stripped in any way.  It's been the subject of many
<BR>
flame wars (about policy and what needs to be stripped), but even some of
<BR>
the glibc folks seem to think that it's a bad idea to do any stripping of
<BR>
glibc.  Besides all of that, though, even stripping out the .note section
<BR>
seems to &quot;incidentally&quot; take out other needed things (symtab and strtab,
<BR>
most notably) on Alpha.  All of this severely breaks static linking on
<BR>
Alpha.
<BR>
<P>I've tried just about every option that I could on strip to no avail.  I
<BR>
just seems to want to ignore -K and take off whatever it wants (btw, -K
<BR>
should only work on one or two archs, PPC is the only I can remember).
<BR>
<P>The worst part is, I need to get a new glibc uploaded ASAP with this
<BR>
change.  Would you like me to binary NMU this or do you have a new release
<BR>
coming soon?
<BR>
<P>C
