Hi,
<BR>
<P><P>I'd like to remind those of you who have forgotton about the meeting
<BR>
or who have forgotton to register.
<BR>
<P>Please forward this mail whereever you find it appropriate.  I'm sure
<BR>
that I have missed some lists and forgot some individual.
<BR>
<P>Following a four-years tradition there will be another Linux Hacker
<BR>
Meeting this year.  It will take place next weekend, officially from
<BR>
friday to saturday, while it is no problem to arrive on thursday and
<BR>
to leave on sunday.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Date: 15th + 16th October 1999
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Location: Oldenburg, University, Wechloy
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Web: <A HREF="http://oldenburger.linuxtage.de/meeting/">http://oldenburger.linuxtage.de/meeting/</A>
<BR>
<P>This Hackers Meeting was formerly known as m68k hackers meeting,
<BR>
though, with the time there were more and more non-m68k (and non-i386
<BR>
as well) boxes so it's a general Linux Hackers Meeting.  This is the
<BR>
fourth meeting.  Since Franky Neumann is far away in Karlsruhe I have
<BR>
taken over administration.
<BR>
<P>Just like the last years, the purpose of this meeting is to get as
<BR>
much of the Linux core developers and active users together to discuss
<BR>
current problems, show off projects, exchange news, and generally to
<BR>
have fun.
<BR>
<P>For those of you who are new to this meeting, Oldenburg is a town in
<BR>
the north of Germany.  It's some 40km far from Bremen and about 40km
<BR>
south of the northern coast (the northsea is about 60km far).  Like
<BR>
last year the meeting will use some rooms at the mathematics
<BR>
department of the local University.
<BR>
<P>One room is reserved for night issues (sleeping if you like) and there
<BR>
will be access to showers as well.  Food (fluid, bread, marmelade,
<BR>
butter, coffee, tea, milk, fruits etc.) will be organized by the local
<BR>
user group and sponsored by a local company, except dinner.
<BR>
<P>We will have sponsored IP access by the local computing center and
<BR>
Joerg Dorchain will - as usual - configure his machine as masquerading
<BR>
gateway during the meeting.  This time we will provide three
<BR>
independent power circuits to avoid a general power failure like last
<BR>
year.
<BR>
<P>It would be good if everyone takes all his networking hardware with
<BR>
him.  Even an internal network can be fun (as we noticed in Solingen
<BR>
'95).  That includes things like:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;. Ethernet/ArcNet(uhm..) boards
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;. Cabling (RG58, RG62, T connectors, terminators, SLIP cabling)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;. Serial terminals for debugging purposes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;. PCs (where available) that could act as gateways/cross compile machines
<BR>
<P>What you should take with you at least:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;. Your computer and monitor, mouse, keyboard, cabling
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;. Other peripherals (CD-ROM, DAT etc.)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;. Technical documentation - 68030/040/060/851/881/882, HP
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc. manuals, VGA controller databooks etc.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;. At least one triple plug to provide power for your machine (of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;course more where available)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;. Long power cable reels where available
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;. Air mattress, sleeping-bag, cushion, ear plug if those next to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you tend to snort :-)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;. Clothes, tooth-brush, tooth-paste, soap, towel
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;. programmer's food - fruit, chocolate, &quot;Haribo&quot;, chips etc.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;. soldering iron, tools, screw-driver, spare parts
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;. Please also take plate, knife/fork and your coffee mug/whatever
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with you.  We will try to provide enough for you but that's still
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unclear.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;. Road map, <A HREF="http://oldenburger.linuxtage.de/meeting/">http://oldenburger.linuxtage.de/meeting/</A> contains a local
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;map beginning at the highway.  Please check out Franky's old
<BR>

<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;!!   Please mark all things that you take with you and want to take  !!
<BR>
&nbsp;!!   back as well with your name!                                    !!
<BR>
<P>On friday lunch can be taken by the local cafeteria, on saturday
<BR>
they're closed but you may eat a second breakfast or walk to McD
<BR>
*sigh*.  Dinner will be eaten as a group in some nice restaurants.
<BR>
<P>We will get some boxes of water, cola, juice for you.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;. Smoking.  In the rooms we use smoking is prohibited.  Please walk
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outside for that.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;. No drunkards.  We won't mind people drinking a beer or two, but
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;please stay reasonable.  If someone starts going wild, we'll have
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him thrown out.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;. Phone: I know that most of you will come with a mobile so you'll
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know how to get reached.  For those who haven't one of use has one
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as well and we can provide his number on demand.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;. Entrance fee:  None!
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;. If anyone starts misusing our ip connection (like trying to hack
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accounts or flood-pinging the network), we'll send him home
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;immediately.  I mean it!  We'll be made responsible for any abuses
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the services we get offered.  We haven't had any problems of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that kind the last two years, but I'll better to mention it.
<BR>
<P>How about those guys who are still very active but have not visited
<BR>
Oldenburg yet - any chance, Andreas etc? :-)
<BR>
