<EM>&gt; &gt; I have had the same problem on a multia (noname).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ls was giving the same problem (Illegal instruction), but that has gone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; away.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Do you remember what you did to make it go away ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't want to reboot the box as long as I don't know that it will come up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; again, since it is also the endpoint of my leased line. (Yeah I know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; running unstable on such a box is stupid, but well :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; THis morning I simply put the broken libc6.1 on hold and tried an update again.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Before the update of the libc6.1 would fail with segfaults.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here first the update of ldso fails with an Illegal instruction, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installs correctly as it seems. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I was first trying to reistall my alpha using the base from slink, then
<BR>
upgrading to potato (do we have a base for potato yet? we should. is
<BR>
anyone working on it?).  the libc6 failed with ilegal instruction.  I then
<BR>
put my old arddrive back in, and tried to update it (it had potato as of
<BR>
about a month ago).  This to failed.  Same problem.  After this, various
<BR>
other prgrams started failing (ls was the most anoying :).  I tried making
<BR>
a chrooted install dir on the other drive to install potato there, but
<BR>
still had the same problem.  libc6.1 in it's current version just refuses
<BR>
to run on my multia.  I haven't tried my new (233 ;) alpha though, still
<BR>
need to find him some ram.
