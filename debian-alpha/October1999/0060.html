<P><EM>&gt;Actually, I've figured it out now. What happened was that when I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;installing the box, 'fdisk' somehow gave me a default end cylinder for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;last partition on the disklabel which was actually one cylinder past the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;end of the disk. Hence the mysterious crash every time I did a make install
</EM><BR>
<P>Ahhh I created a bogus partition on my machine too due the fdisk bug! And
<BR>
to check if that was the case for me too I had the bad idea to:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cp /dev/zero /var/tmp
<BR>
<P>where /var is the last partition with the additional (out of bound) sector
<BR>
included.
<BR>
<P>After some time the kernel crashed and I destroyed all partitions of my
<BR>
hard disk. _all_. Note that the partition table was still fine. Only the
<BR>
contents of the partitons (superblocks mainly) was completly screwed up.
<BR>
<P>fsck was complaining no-magic number.
<BR>
<P>fsck -B4096 -b xxx -y using a rasonable correct backup-superblock (it had
<BR>
at least the magic number in the right place ;) continued running for 5/10
<BR>
minutes then exited complaining something. Then fsck using the backup
<BR>
superblock wasn't working anymore. So i run fsck with the master
<BR>
superblock and it worked but then after 10/15 minutes of `yes` fsck
<BR>
started complaining WARNING ERROR IN FSCK OR YOU HAVE THE DISK MOUNTED or
<BR>
something like that. I hadn't the disk mounted at all...
<BR>
<P>Now (after some hour wasted in restoring the system completly :() I
<BR>
removed 1 sector from the last partition and cp /var/tmp works fine.
<BR>
<P>This is my current partition that now works:
<BR>
<P>BSD label for device: /dev/sda
<BR>
<P>5 partitions:
<BR>
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize   cpg]
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a:  1226752     2048      ext2                        # (Cyl.    2 - 600)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;b:  8192000  1228800      ext2                        # (Cyl.  601 - 4600)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;c: 17772544        0    unused        0     0         # (Cyl.    1 - 8678)

<P>The partition `c' had the right vaue, while fsck suggested me to use 8679
<BR>
for the end of the last partiton `e'. I didn't cared about the correct
<BR>
partition c limit as partition c is a kind of black magic that I don't
<BR>
like and I have to ignore in first place....
<BR>
<P>So this is a warning for people having partition c stopping before one of
<BR>
your partition. fdisk is right about partition c. Trust its end and not
<BR>
what fdisk suggests as end of other partitions.
<BR>
<P>I think the fix is simply a -1 in some line of fdisk... Looks like a
<BR>
silly/typo bug. I cc'ed to the author of the bsdlabel in our fdisk. If he
<BR>
can't fix that I can do that myself.
