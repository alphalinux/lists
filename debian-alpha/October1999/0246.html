<EM>&gt; You don't mention having upgraded anything; did you?

<P>Nothing hardware-wise has changed since I first started using the machine. Only

a slink-&gt;potato upgrade (which isn't hardware ;-).

<EM>&gt; Somehow I think you won't be able to compile a new kernel, as make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; depends quite heavily on the time growing steadily, instead of jumping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around :-(  I was lucky then, as I still had an old backup root
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; partition which I could boot to build a 2.2 kernel on.

<P>Well, if the files are nonexistent, it should build them. It's chewing on a
<BR>
make -j 2 of 2.2.13 right now.
<BR>
<P>Hopefully this will fix things.
