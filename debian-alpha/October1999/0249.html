<P><EM>&gt; Hello everyone,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yesterday I started having strange problems with the Linux system clock (i.e.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the one the date command returns) on my Multia. It returns totally random
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; values, always in the range of January 1970, but all other values random.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Strangely enough, the BIOS hardware clock is perfectly intact, as hwclock
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; returns sane (correct) values.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even if I try to put a value into the system clock (with date --set=&quot;foo&quot; or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hwclock --hctosys), the random values are still returned. This is evidenced in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other programs (apt for example thinks I'm downloading at 0B/s) and getty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; refuses to work, with the returned message &quot;Alarm clock&quot;. I'm not sure what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that message is supposed to mean.
</EM><BR>
<P>What I think has happened (to all of us) is that the &quot;date&quot; program has
<BR>
been silently changed to correspond more with &quot;date&quot; on several
<BR>
other versions of System V.  That is, if you type &quot;date 11030930&quot; it will
<BR>
reset the system clock for you.  The -s flag now sets the clock &lt;string&gt;
<BR>
number of seconds ahead of the current setting; thus every time you type 
<BR>
&quot;date -s 11030930&quot; you add some 127 days to the current time.  If you do
<BR>
this with a longer string including the year as well, you may end up in
<BR>
the next century, and if it's beyond 2038, you end up in 1915, or something.
<BR>
<P>I've been using Debian for several years now, and I'd always used the -s
<BR>
flag to reset the date, so this came as a surprise--and a fairly vexing
<BR>
one, too, since the incorrect timestamp breaks make, package building, and
<BR>
several other things.  It's simple enough to relearn &quot;date&quot;, though :-)
