<P><EM>&gt; I am running potato on an LX and I have recently been having some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interesting problems.  I have upgraded to the 2.2.12 kernel, but the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computer seems to think that I am still at kernel version 2.2.7.  (At
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; least that's what /proc/version tells me)  I compiled the kernel by hand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and am sure that milo booted off of it.
</EM><BR>
<P>MILO didn't use it to boot off of, fyi.  /proc/version is always correct.
<BR>
The way I juggle kernels is to copy the images into / and name them
<BR>
appropriately (eg. vmlinux.2212.gz, etc).  From there, since I have an SX,
<BR>
I make a new boot selection in AlphaBIOS so that it passes the correct
<BR>
boot command to MILO (with the correct new kernel image name inserted) and
<BR>
make it default.  Later on, I go back and delete old entries and kernels.
<BR>
<P>If you don't have the environment stuff set up in AlphaBIOS/ARC, though,
<BR>
make sure you boot using a milo command like:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boot sdb1:/vmlinux.2212.gz root=/dev/sda1
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I also get this strange error
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whenever I run top:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Warning: /usr/src/linux/System.map not parseable as a System.map
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Warning: /System.map has an incorrect kernel version.
</EM><BR>
<P>Make sure to copy the System.map file that is built with your kernel to /
<BR>
or create a softlink to it's real location.  Also, make sure that your
<BR>
version of procps is updated.  There was a problem in a previous version
<BR>
that caused top or ps to display that message all of the time, even if
<BR>
System.map was up-to-date.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I originally decided to upgrade the kernel because when I installed the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; oss package to get my sound card (AWE64)  working, I was no longer able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; print. I have checked the io ranges and interrupts that my alphabios
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believes the soundcard and lpt1 are at, and they do not conflict at all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also in this newest kernel I turned off plug and play support because the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only plug and play card I have is the sound card.  I did this to prevent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the sound card from initializing, but my problem was not solved.  Any help
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you might offer would be appreciated.  Also, if this is not the proper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; list for this question, please direct me to a more suitable one.
</EM><BR>
<P>This, I'm stumped on with the current info given. What kind of Alpha do
<BR>
you run?  Also, email me (not the list) a copy of the .config and I might
<BR>
be able to tell what happened...
