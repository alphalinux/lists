Hi
<BR>
<P>Firstly, I have put new MILO source and binary images on genie.ucd.ie,
<BR>
here is the changelog entry:
<BR>
<P>milo-2.0.35-c7 (source), milo-991007 (binary)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;* New VGA initialisation code from Andrew P. Lentvorski
<BR>
&nbsp;* MSDOS filesystem fixes from Loic Prylli
<BR>
&nbsp;* TGA patches from Martin Lucina
<BR>
&nbsp;* New configuration variable CPU_CLOCK (value in MHz) as an attempt to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work around the SX164 clock speed misdetection problem
<BR>
&nbsp;* This time binaries are built with raw VGA initialisation code as opposed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the non-free Digital BIOS emulator used before
<BR>
&nbsp;* The free BIOS emulator is now in a state of mess, being merged with the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x86emu project's results
<BR>
<P>Still trying to figure out what causes system clock's misbehaviour on
<BR>
SX164, I added the CPU_CLOCK variable which overrides MILO's impression
<BR>
of the CPU clock frequency.  Usage:
<BR>
<EM>	MILO&gt; set CPU_CLOCK 366
</EM><BR>
if you have a 366 MHz system.
<BR>
<P>Depending on the kernel, it may or may not help.  Old kernels used to
<BR>
estimate the cycle frequency themselves when they saw 0 where it was
<BR>
supposed to be.  New kernels (I don't remember where exactly the change
<BR>
happened, somewhere in the 2.2.x line) always estimate it and replace
<BR>
the old value (supplied by MILO or SRM) with the estimated one if they
<BR>
differ more than a certain amount (10% or something).
<BR>
<P>A possible strategy is to set CPU_CLOCK 0 and see the kernel estimate it.
<BR>
<P>Now I should really appreciate it if people with SX164 systems wrote me
<BR>
brief descriptions of situations when their clocks work correctly and
<BR>
when they don't.  What I'm looking for is:
<BR>
- MILO version (if applicable) from /proc/cpuinfo (&quot;system serial number&quot;);
<BR>
- kernel version;
<BR>
- cycle frequency [Hz] (exactly as in /proc/cpuinfo, including the word
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;est.&quot; if present);
<BR>
- actual system's cycle frequency (MHz);
<BR>
- clock behaviour: OK/slow/fast, approx. how much.
<BR>
Just a couple of lines; don't write anything else if you don't want to.
<BR>
Put SX164 in the subject and e-mail it to me (cetus@snowball.ucd.ie).
<BR>
Please.
<BR>
If your system clock is now OK and you don't remember the setup when it
<BR>
was misbehaving, just send me what you know.
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
<P>Nikita
