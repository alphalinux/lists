Hello,
<BR>
I am running potato on an LX and I have recently been having some
<BR>
interesting problems.  I have upgraded to the 2.2.12 kernel, but the
<BR>
computer seems to think that I am still at kernel version 2.2.7.  (At
<BR>
least that's what /proc/version tells me)  I compiled the kernel by hand
<BR>
and am sure that milo booted off of it.  I also get this strange error
<BR>
whenever I run top:
<BR>
<P>Warning: /usr/src/linux/System.map not parseable as a System.map
<BR>
Warning: /System.map has an incorrect kernel version.
<BR>
<P>I originally decided to upgrade the kernel because when I installed the
<BR>
oss package to get my sound card (AWE64)  working, I was no longer able to
<BR>
print. I have checked the io ranges and interrupts that my alphabios
<BR>
believes the soundcard and lpt1 are at, and they do not conflict at all.
<BR>
Also in this newest kernel I turned off plug and play support because the
<BR>
only plug and play card I have is the sound card.  I did this to prevent
<BR>
the sound card from initializing, but my problem was not solved.  Any help
<BR>
you might offer would be appreciated.  Also, if this is not the proper
<BR>
list for this question, please direct me to a more suitable one.
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
