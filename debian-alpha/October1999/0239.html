Hello everyone,
<BR>
<P>Yesterday I started having strange problems with the Linux system clock (i.e.
<BR>
the one the date command returns) on my Multia. It returns totally random
<BR>
values, always in the range of January 1970, but all other values random.
<BR>
Strangely enough, the BIOS hardware clock is perfectly intact, as hwclock
<BR>
returns sane (correct) values.
<BR>
<P>Even if I try to put a value into the system clock (with date --set=&quot;foo&quot; or
<BR>
hwclock --hctosys), the random values are still returned. This is evidenced in
<BR>
other programs (apt for example thinks I'm downloading at 0B/s) and getty
<BR>
refuses to work, with the returned message &quot;Alarm clock&quot;. I'm not sure what
<BR>
that message is supposed to mean.
<BR>
<P>The system is a Multia (aka UDB) 166mhz with 64mb RAM. This problem has only
<BR>
occured in the past day and a half. I cannot really think of anything that
<BR>
would cause this to happen. The current kernel is the one included on the Debian
<BR>
resc1440.bin for the noname alpha architecture (2.0.36, and the one on the
<BR>
harddrive matches the one on the bootdisk, byte-for-byte, and this problem did
<BR>
not occur before on the same kernel). However, I still am going to try
<BR>
compiling a new kernel, just to see if it will work.
<BR>
<P>Anyone have any suggestions?
<BR>
<P><PRE>

Linux is cool. Windows sucks.
Random &quot;fortune:&quot;
No amount of careful planning will ever replace dumb luck.
