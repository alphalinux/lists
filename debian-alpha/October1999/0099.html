Ok...after much headache (and time...geez, glibc takes forever to build),
<BR>
I've fixed the static linking problems on Alpha with later binutils.
<BR>
Turns out that stripping glibc was a Very Bad Thing(TM) and will stop with
<BR>
the next release from Joel (at least on Alpha).  The libc6.1-dbg package
<BR>
will be going away also, since we're not stripping the main libc anymore.
<BR>
<P>In the meantime, I've uploaded 2.1.2-5.0.1 to master today, which should
<BR>
go into the archive tomorrow.  If you want to get a jump on it now, ftp
<BR>
them from the incoming dir (which I highly recommend...these work like a
<BR>
champ).  I will shortly be releasing a new binutils release
<BR>
(weekend-ish...got more work for Compaq to thrash on first), just fyi.
<BR>
