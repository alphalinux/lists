<P><EM>&gt; I've not yet got to a stage where my local mirror is complete enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attempt an upgrade; last time was a couple of months ago (from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experience I've discovered that upgrading unstable/alpha over the net is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not recommended...). However, does this problem only affect a couple of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people, or anyone who installs that libc? If only a couple of people,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one would say there must be something in their setup that triggers it...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hmmm.
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe it's really related to apt since the two so far that have had
<BR>
problems tried with apt.  Maybe a static bash and apt would be in
<BR>
order...I know, we've had arguments on -devel about static binaries, but
<BR>
this makes sense until I can get libc to cooperate with apt again.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As you may have noticed, mutt when compiled with -O2 triggers a compiler
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bug (a function is called with an array value, and the array value x-1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is actually passed).  Do you use -O2 for libc? (although I could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reproduce the problem with gcc 1:2.95.2-0pre1.1).
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but I can't use the normal packaged gcc to compile libc since it
<BR>
still has broken complex support.  I used the cvs version of egcs (with
<BR>
the patch to fix the imaginary accessing with complex numbers).  I'm going
<BR>
to try extract the imaginary patch from the repository, though, to see if
<BR>
we can just squeeze that patch into our normal gcc for now.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Unfortunately gcc is still not quite there for alpha...
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; BTW, why is bigloo-dev not uploaded? bigloo is, and it's built from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same source apparently. I also couldn't find bigloo in the autobuilder
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; status (Chris, when you update the webpages again, please add a link to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.complete.org/~buildd/">http://www.complete.org/~buildd/</A> ).
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, good idea (forgot when I did it yesterday...I've had alot on my mind
<BR>
the past two days).  Unknown as to why bigloo-dev isn't up.
