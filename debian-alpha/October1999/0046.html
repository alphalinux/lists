<EM>&gt; &gt; The crash was quite bizzare also, I've been running kernel 2.2.9 for

<EM>&gt; &gt; ages now but when I did a 'make install' of XFree86 4.0 I just got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; massive filesystem corruption. Doing a 'badblocks' check on /usr
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; afterwards didn't find anything so either I've got a weird hardware

<EM>&gt; &gt; problem or it's the kernel.

<EM>&gt; The fs-corruption was teckled in 2.2.12 AFAIK. So this is a kernel thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you'd ask me.

<P>Actually, I've figured it out now. What happened was that when I was
<BR>
installing the box, 'fdisk' somehow gave me a default end cylinder for the
<BR>
last partition on the disklabel which was actually one cylinder past the
<BR>
end of the disk. Hence the mysterious crash every time I did a make install
<BR>
of XFree86 (since this causes lots of disk accesses).
<BR>
<P>I booted into NetBSD from floppy and their disklabel immediately pointed
<BR>
out that 'partition f extends beyond end of unit'. So I rewrote the
<BR>
disklabel, restored from backup and all seems fine now. The moral of this
<BR>
story is, fdisk sucks and it needs to be rewritten to properly support
<BR>
PC partitions/BSD disklabels/whatever.
