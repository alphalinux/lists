Hello, I am running kernel 2.2.13 with a fireport 40, and a ricoh 7040s
<BR>
cd burner. Its in a sx164 533 alpha. I am trying to get this machine to
<BR>
burn cds. I have everything working so that I have an iso image of the
<BR>
data I want to burn, and I have cdrecord configured. When I start the
<BR>
burn everything starts out fine, I can write the whole image to the cd
<BR>
but during the fixating stage I always get this message:
<BR>
<P>Fixating...
<BR>
cdrecord: Input/output error. close track/session: scsi sendcmd:
<BR>
retryable error
<BR>
CDB:  5B 00 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

<BR>
cmd finished after 41.716s timeout 480s
<BR>
Fixating time:   47.741s
<BR>
<P>The cmd finished after time always changes. I have tryied copying cds
<BR>
directly, making an image of them or just the data files I want on cd
<BR>
but this happends with all of them. The burner works, I put it into a pc
<BR>
and the cd I made were perfect. I hvae tryied everything I can think of.
<BR>
Anyone have an ideas?
<BR>
<P>thanks
<BR>
