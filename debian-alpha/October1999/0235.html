<P>I encountered this problem the other day. It seems that the ldso 1.9.11-5 was
<BR>
corrupted. Shortly after this, however, I found that there was a new package on 
<BR>
the main Debian FTP (may not have reached all mirrors yet), version
<BR>
1.9.11-5.0.1. I downloaded this with ftp and used dpkg to install it. After
<BR>
that, ldconfig was fine.
<BR>
<P>Get this package at ftp.debian.org, as it's certain to be there. It was only
<BR>
updated last night (which is interesting, because 1.9.11-5 has a timestamp that
<BR>
was four days old when it was pulled.)
