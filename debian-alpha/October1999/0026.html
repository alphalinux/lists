Hi -
<BR>
<P>I've currently managed to infiltrate our company network with linux boxes -
<BR>
great so far as they are performing far better than their equivalent windows
<BR>
versions. However, an old Alpha landed on my desk a week ago with the
<BR>
previso that I made it into a file server for our network. Its a personal
<BR>
workstation 433a (miata?) and I've got as far as putting linux onto it
<BR>
(Slink running kernel 2.0.36). The problem is that the scsi card in it is a
<BR>
QLogic ISP 10x0 (1040 I think) and the driver doesnt support
<BR>
disconnect/reconnect. This makes it impractical to as a server (attached to
<BR>
a raid device) and also stops the use of tape drives on it.
<BR>
First question - anybody know where I can get a driver that supports
<BR>
disconnect/reconnect or is it a scsi card problem?
<BR>
<P>I thought I'd upgrade to 2.2.12 to see if the driver was any better but no
<BR>
joy. Firstly the network driver (tulip) seems to have been bumped down a
<BR>
couple of versions and breaks (easily fixed by getting the latest version
<BR>
from www) but when I do get it all running the kernel halts trying to detect
<BR>
my tape drive (cant remember what model but its a DEC dat drive). Any clues?
<BR>
If anyone wants any more info I can send it via email.
<BR>
<P>Cheers
<BR>
<P>Marcus
