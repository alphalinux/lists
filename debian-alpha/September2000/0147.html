<P>
Jay,
<BR>
<P>The machine is a Noritake DEC 1000A 5/400 RM.
<BR>
<P>SRM was fine with the Voodoo. Initially I had problems with GUI install of 
<BR>
Debian but then booted up with &quot;text&quot;. The installation went well after 
<BR>
that.
<BR>
<P>However no matter how many different permutations in XF86config I used the 
<BR>
screen died.
<BR>
<P>I switched back to the Number Nine card that came with the machine and 
<BR>
everything worked well (as well as gnome can be with a 1mb card).
<BR>
<P>Where do I get the ** LATEST ** bios? I managed to find and install 5.7 but 
<BR>
nothing newer.
<BR>
<P>Cheers
<BR>
Iain

<EM>&gt; As for the Voodoo .....mmmm. Bought some time ago for a wintel machine

and
<BR>

put
<BR>
<EM>&gt; it in there instead. Sort of given up now. I can get hold of a Matrox
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Millennium so I will give that a try.
</EM><BR>
<P>What problems have you had? Does it get initialized under SRM via BIOS
<BR>
emulation or do you end up with black screen of death? Or is it the
<BR>
X server you're having trouble with? There are some patches for the
<BR>
problem on EV5 machines if that's what you are running into; let me know.
<BR>
<P>Millennia of either flavor (I or II) should work well; again make sure
<BR>
you have a reasonably recent SRM console version, as a really old one
<BR>
will have trouble even with Millennia...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Oh .... now using RedHat on the machine. Would rather have Debain but all 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seems to work although the 1meg video card gives me sh*t resolution. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think I will stick with Sparcs in the future. Got the Alpha for around 
</EM><BR>
$100
<BR>
<EM>&gt; ... bargain??
</EM><BR>
<P>1. Yes, the builtin Trio64 is 1MB and slow; I assume you found the jumper
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that will disable it, so that other cards can be substituted?
<BR>
<P>2. I'd call it a bargain for an EV5; lots of PCI slots, robust PS, it can
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hold a fair amount of memory. Makes a UDB look petrified... ;-}
