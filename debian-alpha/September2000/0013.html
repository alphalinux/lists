<EM>&gt; Permedia2. More are available under 2.4.x, including nVidia and 3Dfx

<EM>&gt; work - Cirrus, SiS, Mach64.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is very good news!  Thank you for clarifying that.  The docs I found
<BR>
were pretty antiquated.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I believe there was working support for 3Dfx in 3.3.6, though it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wasn't built by default on Alpha even though it did work.
</EM><BR>
<P>Did it?  I'm still running an ancient S3 card in mine, so I didn't know
<BR>
whether or not to recommend enabling it for Alpha for Debian.  I seemed to
<BR>
recall some issues with it, but that could've been with a prior X release.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But, it sounded as if the 1000A SRM console did work OK with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Voodoo3, which is the first hurdle that must be cleared. Whether
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it would work with others, such as nVidia or the like, is unclear;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it must be tried to find out. Using the latest SRM console available
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the 1000A is the best bet, but I'm almost certain (at least) the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; later nVidia cards would not work, as the BIOS emulator only recently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (on the EV6 platforms at least) became able to run their code... :-\
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, I noted that SRM seemed ok with with it, which puts the kernel in
<BR>
focus as the next &quot;let's see if this is the problem&quot; step of diagnosing
<BR>
their situation.
