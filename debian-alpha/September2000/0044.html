<P>
Progress at last.
<BR>
<P>I installed DarkHelmet in text mode an all went well. However when the
<BR>
machine reboots and when I point to the boot device I get error messages and
<BR>
it refused to boot ..... bad block device etc ..... I have checked the
<BR>
syntax a million times and I am convinced it is ok.
<BR>
<P>Anyone any thoughts? 
<BR>
<P>I'm becoming rather upset with Alphas ...... it only took me 2 days to
<BR>
master linux on Sparcs.
<BR>
<P>Cheers
<BR>

<P>I'll take that sparc if you don't want it :-P  (I've got three older

<P>Question on your problem, though...once it gets past SRM, is there ANY
<BR>
text echoed to the screen (ie. kernel messages) or is it just blank?  I'm
<BR>
wondering if it's the kernel at fault or if it's something else.  If the
<BR>
kernel text is showing, then that's one more thing we can probably
<BR>
eliminate.  Also, if it's DarkHelmet...er...RedHat, then I believe they
<BR>
run the vga16 server for part of their install (please correct me if I'm
<BR>
wrong...it's been awhile since I played with RH), which may also have
<BR>
some problem dealing with the V3.
