<EM>&gt; All joking aside, there are only a few &quot;framebuffer&quot; drivers that work on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha (that is, using the framebuffer device driver).  I just quickly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looked in the kernel docs and the only ones that I could find listed are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Matrox and TGA framebuffer drivers (the docs may be outdated, though).
</EM><BR>
<P>It should be better than that; I went through 2.2.17-pre and
<BR>
2.4.0-test6-pre and fixed a few small problems that made some of the
<BR>
others work as well; Rage128 was one that I fixed, along with
<BR>
Permedia2. More are available under 2.4.x, including nVidia and 3Dfx
<BR>
which worked OOTB on Alpha, but a number were not checked or didn't
<BR>
work - Cirrus, SiS, Mach64.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; HOWEVER, this does NOT preclude you from using that card in an Alpha.  In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fact, most Voodoo3 cards are known to work in Alphas (I haven't heard of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one that doesn't yet), although we don't have an X server for them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yet in the stable tree of Debian.  You could compile one, however, if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you're so inclined to install XFree86 4.0.x.
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe there was working support for 3Dfx in 3.3.6, though it
<BR>
wasn't built by default on Alpha even though it did work.
<BR>
<P>But, it sounded as if the 1000A SRM console did work OK with the
<BR>
Voodoo3, which is the first hurdle that must be cleared. Whether
<BR>
it would work with others, such as nVidia or the like, is unclear;
<BR>
it must be tried to find out. Using the latest SRM console available
<BR>
for the 1000A is the best bet, but I'm almost certain (at least) the
<BR>
later nVidia cards would not work, as the BIOS emulator only recently
<BR>
(on the EV6 platforms at least) became able to run their code... :-\
