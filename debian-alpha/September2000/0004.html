King of Framebuffers ........ I wish (-:
<BR>
<P>Last night I tried to install an other brand of linux (shall remain nameless
<BR>
but there is a &quot;hat&quot; involved) because I have had problems getting hold of
<BR>
potato for alpha. I assume that my problems are generic rather than with the
<BR>
&quot;hatted&quot; brand.
<BR>
<P>When booting the AlphaServer 1000A from SRM with a CD the GUI install the
<BR>
screen goes blank as it the VGA card is not supported. After replacing the
<BR>
VGA card with a more generic Cirrus card all went well ... almost (a story
<BR>
for another day). The screen went blank also when booting with the Voodoo3.
<BR>
<P>I have heard it rumoured that Alphas have problems with fancy video cards
<BR>
.... is this true? Should I just go back to Potato for Sparc? Are Alpha's
<BR>
too much hassle?
<BR>
<P>Cheers
<BR>

<P>All joking aside, there are only a few &quot;framebuffer&quot; drivers that work on
<BR>
Alpha (that is, using the framebuffer device driver).  I just quickly
<BR>
looked in the kernel docs and the only ones that I could find listed are
<BR>
the Matrox and TGA framebuffer drivers (the docs may be outdated, though).
<BR>
<P>HOWEVER, this does NOT preclude you from using that card in an Alpha.  In
<BR>
fact, most Voodoo3 cards are known to work in Alphas (I haven't heard of
<BR>
one that doesn't yet), although we don't have an X server for them
<BR>
yet in the stable tree of Debian.  You could compile one, however, if
<BR>
you're so inclined to install XFree86 4.0.x.
