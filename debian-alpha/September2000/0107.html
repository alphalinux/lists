<P><EM>&gt; Did anybody have problems caused by platform differences? For example,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; did you ever compile and run a program on one linux distribution w/o
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problems while have troubles to deal with the same program on another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distribution?
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm...are you talking architecture differences or distribution
<BR>
differences?  I've had trouble with both, but not necessarily at the same
<BR>
time.  What problems are you having (specifically)?  This request is a bit
<BR>
too vague, IMO.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If so, could you please let me know what is your problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and how you solved it? Does anybody have any experience to avoid the effects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on compiling and runing programs from different platforms ?
</EM><BR>
<P>I've had tons of experience porting things to 64-bit platforms, as well as
<BR>
porting things to Linux itself (regardless of architecture).  Each
<BR>
distribution has it's own nuances and quirks, most of which can be easily
<BR>
gotten around (since most are just differences in file locations).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Any response to the above topics will be greatly appreciated!! Your rich
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experience is a huge help to me.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hehehehe...experience is something I have tons of (as do most of the
<BR>
people on this list...working on Alphas frequently involves recompiling
<BR>
things and/or patching them so that they will work properly...most of the
<BR>
world seems to be 32-bit-centric).
