<P>
Well, here it comes. Glibc 2.1.94, hot of the glibc release process. I'm
<BR>
currently building i386, powerpc and sparc, which I will upload throughout
<BR>
the day and tonight as I build them. These are going into woody. Several
<BR>
notes for the other ports (the ones I cannot build).
<BR>
<P>This upload consists of 4 parts (listed in the subject). The gcc NMU is
<BR>
ok'd by Matthias and comes with several patches from him. Also added by me
<BR>
is some code to make the libg++ and libstdc++ upgrades go fine with the
<BR>
new Glibc, plus a backport of the gpc to 2.95.2-13 (the last version
<BR>
that will compile on non-{i386,m68k}).
<BR>
<P>Also, because libdb1,2 is no longer in glibc, the new libdb2 NMU (not
<BR>
authorized, but I will email the maintainer) will take over the
<BR>
libdb.so.[23] sonames (via symlink). This is only a hack until packages
<BR>
compiled against the old glibc provided libdb can be recompiled against
<BR>
libdb2. NOTE: some programs (like exim) will report something to the
<BR>
affect of &quot;foo requires versioned symbols&quot; because the libdb2 is not
<BR>
versioned. This does not appear to cause any problems, and is actually
<BR>
output from ld.so. For now libc6 pre-depends on libdb2, just so we don't
<BR>
get any broken packages on upgrade. Once everything gets recompiled
<BR>
against libdb2, that can be removed (hopefully before release with some
<BR>
effort).
<BR>
<P>The third part is nss_db. Since libdb2 is no longer in glibc proper, and
<BR>
because nss_db requires a db library, it was split upstream. It is now a
<BR>
seperate package (known as libnss-db). For now libc6 pre-depends on
<BR>
libnss-db, also so we don't break any systems.
<BR>
<P>Build order for ports:
<BR>
<P>1) Build the new gcc_2.95.2-15. Do NOT upload this build, but install it.
<BR>
2) Build glibc 2.1.94-1, do not install yet
<BR>
3) Build db2 and nss_db
<BR>
4) Upgrade libdb2 (and -dev, for later steps) and all libc6 packages
<BR>
5) Rebuild gcc_2.95.2-15 (save this one for uploading) and install
<BR>
6) Rebuild glibc and install (you can probably skip this if you want)
<BR>
6) Now build the two other packages (nss_db, db2)
<BR>
<P>This should suffice for a clean build. Of course, your preferences may
<BR>
vary. Good thing is, 2.2 does not require rebuilding anything else (that I
<BR>
have seen), and if it does, IMO it is a bug (versioned symbols are meant
<BR>
just for that purpose).
<BR>
<P>Other notes about the new glibc:
<BR>
<P>* nss1 compat is gone
<BR>
* ldconfig is now provided by glibc for all archs, ldso will remove it.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me know how this works on libc5 systems. TBH, I am not overly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;concerned with that though. The ldso package is a henderence nowadays
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and we should stop relying on it. I have plans for lots of things with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ldconfig, including an /etc/ld.so.d/ directory for packages to supply
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;their specific directories, and a dpkg friendly update-ld.so.cache
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;script that works similar to the update-menus script, but it has to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;contend with other things.
