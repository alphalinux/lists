<P>Thanks, I would have done that if I had access to Tru64 or something like
<BR>
that :) 
<BR>
Anyway, thanks for all the mails I got with suggestions! I finally found
<BR>
this lovely little program called srmbootfat and voila :)
<BR>
<P>Then I had to fight two more days to get my 3com nic (3c59x) working, with
<BR>
2.0.x kernels it came up at IRQ 10, but with 2.2.x I had to physically
<BR>
move the card to get different that IRQ (it doesn't work with 13 or 15).
<BR>
<P>Nonames seems strange when it comes to the hardware, can you (in linux)
<BR>
tweak the memory speed settings the 21066 offers, or is it a waste of time
<BR>
even thinking about it? It seems to love heavy overclocking :)
<BR>
<P>Now everything seems to work, so that I can go back to being a happy
<BR>
Debian user. I hope it takes a really long time before woody gets stable :)
