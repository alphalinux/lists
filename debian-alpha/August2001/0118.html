<EM>&gt; Without. Not necessary to make such a setting for ARC or

<EM>&gt; AlphaBIOS machines (correct me if there are exceptions!).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Just to remember: There are now two reports about Milo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.2.17 not working: On PC164 and on XLT. Both have ARC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; firmware, right Don?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, my XLT has Alphabios version 5.70 installed.  I have contacted
<BR>
Stepan Reinauer about this and we are just starting to work on it.  I
<BR>
have tried both the 2.2.18 and 2.2.17 milos and neither work here. I
<BR>
have also tried compiling his source using the gcc-3.0 and it bombs
<BR>
out.  He has not tested his milos on an XLT before due to
<BR>
non-availability of a test platform, according to his notes.  We may
<BR>
have a bit of work ahead of us since I am NOT a &quot;coder&quot; and he doesn't
<BR>
have the hardware.
<BR>
<P>A note for those who might want to compile the source.  The newer milos
<BR>
have support for reiserfs available.  This means that you need the
<BR>
resiserfs patch applied to the kernel source tree, even if you don't use
<BR>
it in order for the milo source to compile...at least that is happening
<BR>
here.  
<BR>
<P>Just another &quot;thought&quot;...the XLT is a ALCOR machine.  This problem with
<BR>
milos might extend to other ALCOR style machines...dunno.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
