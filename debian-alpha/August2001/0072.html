<EM>&gt; Ummm.....yes and no. Do you have a DP264 or UP2000? Your subject says one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing but the above text talks about a DP264. They are 2 different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boards. Dp264 firmware comes from Compaq, if you downloaded it from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; API site it just came from Compaq. Up2000 firmware is built inside API.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, that's not entirely clear. The original firmware on the machine was for
<BR>
DP264, though all the instructions and other material that came with the
<BR>
motherboard was labelled UP2000. The board itself doesn't have any obvious
<BR>
label identifying either, though it does say (c) 1999 Alpha Processor. Maybe
<BR>
that indicates a UP2000?
<BR>
<P>However, it appears that it was not installed in a proper slot. When I moved
<BR>
it to the PCI slot closed to the edge of the board, it came right up. I was
<BR>
under the impression that the &quot;first&quot; slot would be the one closest to the
<BR>
processor. Also, it's interesting that while the ATI RagePro-based Xpert 98
<BR>
runs fine in any slot, the ATI Rage128-based Xpert 128 will not.
<BR>
<P>Ugh. I had assumed this would be more complicated than it was. Thanks for the
<BR>
suggestion.
