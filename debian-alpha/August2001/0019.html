<EM>&gt; &gt; I can try them on a ruffian which is currently out of production due to

<EM>&gt; &gt; some technical difficulties and on my LX, maybe on an XP1000. Regarding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; my LX I cannot complete the installation due to missing network (i.e.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; only modem).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That would be perfect!
</EM><BR>
<P>Hi Thimo,
<BR>
<P>I just joined the alpha list today, but earlier this week I looked
<BR>
over the archives from the past month or so (unfortunately, lists.d.o
<BR>
seems to be down now, so it's hard to find some of the previous
<BR>
messages on this topic) and followed your progress with boot floppies.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, if possible, I'd like to try to help out with these Alpha boot
<BR>
floppies for woody (since I'm really hoping Alpha can be an included
<BR>
architecture).  I'm not a debian-developer, and almost all my
<BR>
programming experience is with scientific simulations (in C/C++
<BR>
though, not Fortran, at least recently (-;) rather than with
<BR>
system-level code, but I'd still like to contribute if I can.  Also,
<BR>
most of my Debian/GNU Linux experience is with the x86 architecture,
<BR>
but now I'm running parallel simulations on a number of dual DP264's, so
<BR>
I've been trying to get up to speed with them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Secondly is this the right list to post the problems/results ? I am not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; much of a C programmer so I can only limit myself to bug reports though. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bug reports are perfect, testing the disks doesn't mean that you have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to fix all bugs you encounter :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think that Alpha-specialities should be discussed on debian-alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first, because the probability of someone knowing a solution to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem will be slighly larger. But that is only my opinion. Falk,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what do you think about it?
</EM><BR>
<P>So, if I remember correctly from past emails I saw in the archive, you
<BR>
and Falk are coordinating these boot floppies.  I'll follow your lead
<BR>
in any way you suggest.  I also remember that one of you had some
<BR>
bandwidth difficulties, and was potentially looking for a test
<BR>
machine.  Contact me offlist if I can help in this regard.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; By the way, if you wait one or two days, unhacked disks may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; available as the too-big-rootdisk-problem is said to be fixed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CU
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Thimo
</EM><BR>
<P>BTW, good luck with finishing up your thesis!
<BR>
<P>Take care,
<BR>
<P>Daniel
