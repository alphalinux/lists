Hi,
<BR>
<P>I've built new boot floppies from the current boot-floppies CVS and
<BR>
put them on <A HREF="ftp://134.2.15.134/boot-floppies/disks-alpha/.">ftp://134.2.15.134/boot-floppies/disks-alpha/.</A> I think
<BR>
they are now in a state to be added to ftp.debian.org at the next
<BR>
boot-floppies release. I've used MILO 2.2-17 this time, since 2.2-18
<BR>
was reported to be broken on at least two subarchitectures.
<BR>
Unfortunately, I have only my SX164 to test, so I'd appreciate any
<BR>
reports. I have not yet tested the complete installation on my
<BR>
machine, since I have pppoe for internet access which isn't supported.
<BR>
<P>&quot;make release&quot; now works fine except for two things:
<BR>
<P>* You need the &quot;srmbootfat&quot; tool from the MILO source. In the long
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;run, this could be provided by a MILO deb package. Currently, we
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;could either require it to be locally installed, or I could add it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to the CVS. It's two files of 12k (GPL). If this is considered a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;good idea, I'd like to create an &quot;alpha-specials&quot; dir. Any opinions?
<BR>
<P>* Downloading via apt-get still doesn't work because of dependency
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;problems. Could I perhaps just commit the &quot;fake-get&quot; hack which uses
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;wget instead and activate it for Alpha? Even if we fiddle with the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;packages, this problem can always reappear.
<BR>
<P>Hmm, that's it for now :) Next thing will be to fix netboot. We could
<BR>
also need a tester for nautilus, since I have no idea about the
<BR>
current state.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falk
