<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't see the point in this. It would blow up the build time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; tremendously, by several hours, and we would end up with exactly the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; same images that we could download. Should we need to do special
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; tweaks for Debian, we can still grab the source; it's GPL after all.
</EM><BR>
<P>would someone please grab the source and put it in the build tree
<BR>
somewhere?  i don't want to see the situation crop up again where only a
<BR>
couple of people in a couple of places have the ability to build milo, and
<BR>
where it is only buildable on a couple of kernel versions... [as happened
<BR>
a couple of years ago when jay was one of the few people able to build it]
<BR>
..... dumping it into a buildd every so often would at least mean that
<BR>
someone was aware that it wasn't working at all!  :(
<BR>
<P>saying &quot;oh lets just use SuSE's images&quot; is lame, LAZY, and really not very
<BR>
smart.  use their patches, but import the source too.
