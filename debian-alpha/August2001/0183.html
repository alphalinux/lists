<EM>&gt; &gt; 	I can confirm both of the above statements. My two XLTs have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; AlphaBIOS (5.66 if I remember correctly), and I have never gotten one to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; boot with any 2.2 based milo. I always had to resort back to the 2.0 based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; milos, which of course do not support the 2.2 ext2fs. Both of my XLTs have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; two extra partitions, one fat for milo, and one 2.0 ext2fs for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; kernel. Then everything works just fine. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why not just put the kernel next to the milo onto the FAT partition?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Should work fine with any version... I added that recommentation to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the installation manual as a workaround for now.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very good question... :) Probably because at the time I was
<BR>
under the impression that AlphaBIOS could only boot Milo from fat, and
<BR>
Milo could only boot the kernel from ext2fs (2.0 type at that). That, and
<BR>
I think I was pretty tired of fighting with the computer by the time I got
<BR>
the above figured out, and didn't think of throwing milo and the kernel on
<BR>
the same fat partition (which I have done before on system where the SCSI
<BR>
card will not boot lilo correctly, but will boot DOS, which then boots
<BR>
loadlin, and finally linux :).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both my XLTs I plan on converting soon to RAID for all filesystems
<BR>
(with 2.2.x kernels), and I will put both the kernel and milo on a fat at
<BR>
that time. Good idea to add it to the installation manual, it will save
<BR>
other people from pulling out their hair over the machines. TTYL.
