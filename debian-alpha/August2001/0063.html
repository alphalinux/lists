<EM>&gt; would someone please grab the source and put it in the build tree

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where it is only buildable on a couple of kernel versions... [as happened
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a couple of years ago when jay was one of the few people able to build it]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ..... dumping it into a buildd every so often would at least mean that

<EM>&gt; someone was aware that it wasn't working at all!  :(

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; saying &quot;oh lets just use SuSE's images&quot; is lame, LAZY, and really not very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; smart.  use their patches, but import the source too.
</EM><BR>
<P>Bascially I agree with you. If woody would not be in a imminent freeze
<BR>
I would wholehartly agree. But being around some time I noticed that
<BR>
it seems not easy to get &quot;general bootable&quot; milos. Often I read
<BR>
statments like &quot;take the milo from rh xx&quot; becaus the latest ones don't
<BR>
work. Since e.g. the ruffian milo got a binary patch (!) from Jay
<BR>
to boot on all machines I doubt that we can get them quickly to build
<BR>
and run on all machines. At least SuSEs milos are well tested and
<BR>
&quot;approved&quot; (by users, not some organisation). Since I don't use milo
<BR>
(anymore) please object if I am mistaken here.
<BR>
<P>Thats why I second the idea to keep SuSEs milos for woody. Next step
<BR>
would be of course to build them ourselves. 
<BR>
<P>How was this done for potato ?
