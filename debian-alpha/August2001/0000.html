<P>
I seem to be VERY unsuccessful in getting patches into the kernel anymore,
<BR>
so I figured I'd try sending them to you first due to your high success
<BR>
rate :-)
<BR>
<P>Attached is a patch that does three things:
<BR>
* drivers/char/rtc.c:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Removes MIPS DECstation epoch support for non-MIPS machines and adds
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;standard PC (1900) epoch support in its place (which will act
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;as a pre-2000 VMS epoch support patch as well).  It also adds post-2000
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;VMS epoch support.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;My testing so far has shown that, with this patch, I can NEVER seem to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;guess the year incorrectly, regardless of where it was set.
<BR>
<P>* arch/alpha/kernel/smp.c:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Removed smp_tune_scheduling() function and the cacheflush_time var
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;since they weren't being used.  I also ran into a few machine types 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;where this function being executed on an SMP machine during boot caused
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;an oops.  I didn't bother looking into it too much (since the entire
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;purpose of the function was to determine cacheflush_time, which is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;unused in the 2.4 scheduler code), but deleting the function works in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;getting SMP systems to boot 2.4 SMP kernels.
<BR>
<P>* arch/alpha/kernel/entry.S:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;arch/alpha/kernel/proto.h:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;arch/alpha/kernel/traps.c:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This patch is from Daniel Potts (a coworker) who found out that, if the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;user invokes the crlfen PALcode call, the kernel is unable to cope with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;not having access to the FP registers.  He wrote two asm stubs to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;basically skip FP register access in these cases.  The problem was found
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to be extremely rare, but definite is a way for a user (non-root) to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;crash a running Alpha.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There's also a small patch from Rick Gorton (also a coworker) that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;allows an illop trap to be handled correctly by the kernel.
<BR>
<P>If you have any questions about the patches, feel free to ask :-)  I'm
<BR>
extremely concerned about the problems that Daniel found (with the ability
<BR>
of a common user to crash a running machine by just disabling FP
<BR>
registers), so the sooner this goes in, the better off we all will be :-)
<BR>
<P>Thanks!
