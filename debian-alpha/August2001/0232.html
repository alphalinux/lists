<P><EM>&gt;   This time my problem is with wdm: having (as by everyone's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggestion) dist-upgraded to woody, I have resolved most of my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problems with XFree+G450 etc but a few remain:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   1) Numerous floating point exceptions by various programs, including
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OpenDX, plotmtv and some others. Any ideas where to go to?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Re-compiling with gcc-3.0 or disabling IEEE floats from kernel?
</EM><BR>
<P>Can you make a list of binaries with FPEs?  I can recompile them
<BR>
(recompilation with -mieee is usually the way to fix this).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   2) aptitude segfaults - anyone got any experience with that? Both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; binary .deb and compiled from source segfault always and immediately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; upon invocation. I had a quick strace with aptitude, but it did not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reveal a thing. Aptitude has just output some ncurses-looking stuff,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; breaks three times and gets a sigsegv.
</EM><BR>
<P>I was afraid of this.  I'll have to recompile it with gcc-3.0.  Even then,
<BR>
I'm not sure it's going to compile.  I'll try it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   3) wdm dislikes non-ascii (I assume) characters both in passwords and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in usernames. This is not really a show stopper since xdm and gdm both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accept them but wdm is the only one of these three that let you choose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your window manager out of the box: I know I can tweak gdm's list of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;sessions&quot; and I can install a  wm-chooser but I'd rather keep it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simple and have only one program mingle with it. Again, both the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compiled from sources version and the binary package exhibit the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem. Note that X and VT's do accept those charactersOC even though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wdm does not so the problem must lie in wdm or wdmLogin.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not sure about this one since I don't run X very often (and never run
<BR>
{x,w,g}dm.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Oh, by the way, is xserver-xfree86 4.0.3's mga.o somehow broken? It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; freezes up both my keyboard and blanks my display (doesn't blank,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually: the display just says its input is out of sync range) while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4.1.0's mga.o works like a dream with the same configuration file.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This goes on on the same machine which has one graphics card: G450
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DualHead with 16 meg's of ram. This is just a curiosa - I grabbed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; xserver-xfree86 4.1.0 from sid.
</EM><BR>
<P>There were some big changes for Alpha that got included in 4.1.0 that
<BR>
weren't in 4.0.3.  I used 4.0.3 on a UP2k with a Millenium I for awhile
<BR>
with no problems, but I never tried it with a G4x0.
<BR>
