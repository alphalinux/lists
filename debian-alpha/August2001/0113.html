<EM>&gt; Well, things may be different on Ruffian since it has it's own ARC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; variant. I'd then have to include some kludge to add an x86 bootsector
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the image.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, Deskstation Ruffian is the only ARCS BIOS platform to
<BR>
bother, as Linux never did run on Deskstation Raptor, right?
<BR>
Just for the records: Ruffian is 164UX with ARCS BIOS, Raptor
<BR>
is PC164 with ARCS BIOS, correct?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Hm, I'm open for suggestions about which MILOs to take.  Should I just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use those from potato?  I'm not sure they understand sparse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; superblocks...
</EM><BR>
<P>Ummm, no they don't. More precise: I played around a while with
<BR>
potato Milo and a PC164, creating new file systems on spare space
<BR>
on one of my hard disks, and got the following results:
<BR>
<P>PC164 Milo from potato
<BR>
- is not able to read from a file system with sparse superblocks
<BR>
- is not able to read *any* filesystem created using potato (I
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;tried &quot;mkfs -O none &lt;device&gt;&quot;)
<BR>
- is able to read from a ext2 filesystem created from within my
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;somehow&quot; updated RedHat 5.1(!) installation (sorry, I have
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing &quot;in between&quot;)
<BR>
<P>That leaves us ARC users (if it wasn't a pure coincidence that
<BR>
Milo-2.2.17 didn't work for Don Spoon on his XLT) in a rather
<BR>
weird situation:
<BR>
- All &quot;Reinauer&quot; Milos do not work.
<BR>
- Milo from potato does work, but can't read &quot;up-to-date&quot; ext2
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;filesystems (maybe some other change before the introduction
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of sparse superblocks is to be blamed or maybe current impls
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;simply are not able to create backwards compatible filesystems).
<BR>
<P>Other suggestions?
<BR>
