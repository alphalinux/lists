<P>
As people have probably noticed we've done a number of security
<BR>
advisories over the last few days, and doing those has made it
<BR>
clear that the way we currently do those will not scale with
<BR>
future release.
<BR>
<P>The problem is the number of architectures we have to support.
<BR>
For potato we have to recompile on 4 architectures, which is
<BR>
a hassle but doable. Besides having to wait for recompiles to
<BR>
finish we also frequently run into missing build-depends and
<BR>
have to wait for someone from DSA to install those for us,
<BR>
which means it might (worst case) take days before we have all
<BR>
the needed packages.
<BR>
<P>With the extra architectures that woody will add that is simply
<BR>
not going to work anymore. Now it so happens there is an excellent
<BR>
solution for this: rbuilder. With rbuilder one can simply send
<BR>
an email to a build machine and it will install the build-depends
<BR>
and build the package automatically. This means we can spent
<BR>
our time a lot more effectively.
<BR>
<P>This brings me to my point: with the release of woody the security
<BR>
team can no longer handle doing all the recompiles manually, and
<BR>
as a result of that we will only support architectures which have a
<BR>
working rbuilder setup that we can use.
<BR>
<P>I realize that setting up rbuilder is not trivial, but given that
<BR>
woody won't be released soon there should be plenty of time for
<BR>
people to set those up.
<BR>
<P>Wichert.
