<P>
Attached is a (possibly temporary) patch for another 2.4 bug I found. This
<BR>
time, executing something like the following code will cause a crash to srm
<BR>
or an oops:
<BR>
{
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;unsigned long *myaddr = 0xffffffffffffc000;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*myaddr = 7; /* bye bye */
<BR>
}
<BR>
<P>It appears to me that the self-mapping entry in each task page table is
<BR>
somehow getting corrupted, causing user mode permission bits to be set. I
<BR>
don't even know why we have this mapping because a running kernel does not
<BR>
use it. While the patch does make it go away, I'm still concerned that
<BR>
something just happened to trash that memory. This one needs to be examined
<BR>
closer.
<BR>
<P>Line 63 of linux-2.4.7/arch/alpha/mm/init.c
<BR>
<P>Btw, the clrfen and illop bug patch (entry.S/proto.h/traps.c) need to be
<BR>
applied to 2.2.x kernels also!
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
Daniel

<EM>&gt; Subject: A few patches for 2.4.x for Alpha...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I seem to be VERY unsuccessful in getting patches into the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kernel anymore,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so I figured I'd try sending them to you first due to your 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; high success
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rate :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Attached is a patch that does three things:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * drivers/char/rtc.c:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Removes MIPS DECstation epoch support for non-MIPS machines and adds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   standard PC (1900) epoch support in its place (which will act
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   as a pre-2000 VMS epoch support patch as well).  It also 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; adds post-2000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   VMS epoch support.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   My testing so far has shown that, with this patch, I can 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; NEVER seem to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   guess the year incorrectly, regardless of where it was set.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * arch/alpha/kernel/smp.c:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Removed smp_tune_scheduling() function and the cacheflush_time var
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   since they weren't being used.  I also ran into a few machine types 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   where this function being executed on an SMP machine during 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boot caused
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   an oops.  I didn't bother looking into it too much (since the entire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   purpose of the function was to determine cacheflush_time, which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   unused in the 2.4 scheduler code), but deleting the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; function works in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   getting SMP systems to boot 2.4 SMP kernels.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * arch/alpha/kernel/entry.S:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   arch/alpha/kernel/proto.h:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   arch/alpha/kernel/traps.c:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   This patch is from Daniel Potts (a coworker) who found out 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that, if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   user invokes the crlfen PALcode call, the kernel is unable 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to cope with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   not having access to the FP registers.  He wrote two asm stubs to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   basically skip FP register access in these cases.  The 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem was found
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   to be extremely rare, but definite is a way for a user (non-root) to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   crash a running Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   There's also a small patch from Rick Gorton (also a coworker) that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   allows an illop trap to be handled correctly by the kernel.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you have any questions about the patches, feel free to ask :-)  I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extremely concerned about the problems that Daniel found 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (with the ability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of a common user to crash a running machine by just disabling FP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; registers), so the sooner this goes in, the better off we all 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks!
