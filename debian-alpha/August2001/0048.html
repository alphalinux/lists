<EM>&gt; I seem to be VERY unsuccessful in getting patches into the kernel anymore,

<EM>&gt; so I figured I'd try sending them to you first due to your high success
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rate :-)

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Attached is a patch that does three things:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * drivers/char/rtc.c:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Removes MIPS DECstation epoch support for non-MIPS machines and adds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   standard PC (1900) epoch support in its place (which will act
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   as a pre-2000 VMS epoch support patch as well).  It also adds post-2000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   VMS epoch support.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   My testing so far has shown that, with this patch, I can NEVER seem to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   guess the year incorrectly, regardless of where it was set.
</EM><BR>
<P>I usually don't enjoy changes in the RTC since it's not easy to audit
<BR>
them (I've no idea where are the specs for such rtc settings and it
<BR>
is more a guess for a few different protocols rather than a well
<BR>
designed algorithm sigh). However I checked they won't break my alpha
<BR>
box and I don't have any mips so I've no problem with them personally (I
<BR>
fit in the digital unix epoch).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; * arch/alpha/kernel/smp.c:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Removed smp_tune_scheduling() function and the cacheflush_time var
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   since they weren't being used.  I also ran into a few machine types 
</EM><BR>
<P>The space they waste is irrelevant, so I'd prefer not to drop it, we may
<BR>
use it in the future.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   where this function being executed on an SMP machine during boot caused
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   an oops.  I didn't bother looking into it too much (since the entire
</EM><BR>
<P>I guess the reason it broke is because maybe there wasn't any cpu with
<BR>
hardid 0 in the machine, so I will apply this patch to my tree instead
<BR>
of dropping the code:

<EM>&gt;   This patch is from Daniel Potts (a coworker) who found out that, if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   user invokes the crlfen PALcode call, the kernel is unable to cope with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   not having access to the FP registers.  He wrote two asm stubs to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   basically skip FP register access in these cases.  The problem was found
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   to be extremely rare, but definite is a way for a user (non-root) to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   crash a running Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   There's also a small patch from Rick Gorton (also a coworker) that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   allows an illop trap to be handled correctly by the kernel.
</EM><BR>
<P>perfect.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you have any questions about the patches, feel free to ask :-)  I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extremely concerned about the problems that Daniel found (with the ability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of a common user to crash a running machine by just disabling FP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; registers), so the sooner this goes in, the better off we all will be :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Indeed. Thanks!
