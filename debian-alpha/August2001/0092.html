<EM>&gt; It also seems that (at least ruffian) needs a x86 bootsector on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; floppy to boot it (the bios says the OsLoader path is invalid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; othervise). I tried using boot-text.b from lilo, which works fine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Any other archs that need this?

<P>Goswin: We are talking specifically about the Milo floppies
<BR>
here, right?

<P>[Goswin, I re-read your mail and do answer a second time,
<BR>
sorry to all recipients for this inconvenience.]
<BR>
<P>AFAIK, all useful Milo floppies do have to be DOS-comformant
<BR>
in the &quot;file system&quot; sense (FAT). I am just not sure if this
<BR>
answers your question or if there are other wrinkles in the
<BR>
&quot;x86 boot sector&quot; you asked for (or even worse: &quot;Ruffian-only&quot;
<BR>
stuff).
<BR>
<P>Again, AFAIK, all non-SRM systems (may it be ARC, AlphaBIOS
<BR>
or even ARCS BIOS) do not &quot;know&quot; anything other than FAT to
<BR>
boot from, and boot floppies are of most interest for people
<BR>
who do run such non-SRM systems.
<BR>
<P>To be fair, I must admit that all my current Milo testing on
<BR>
PC164 and 164LX was made by loading Milo from hard disk (you
<BR>
guessed it: from a FAT formatted partition).
<BR>
