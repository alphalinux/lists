<P><EM>&gt; Hey,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have some experinces to share with you and I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like som feedback on this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It all started when I wanted to install Dia
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (<A HREF="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~alla/dia/dia.html">http://www.lysator.liu.se/~alla/dia/dia.html</A>)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The version for Potato/Alpha is currently 0.83, while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Dia is out in 0.85. I tought nothing of this and installed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 0.83 by using apt. However, there were some things from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 0.85 that weren't present in 0.83, so I decided to go ahead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and install 0.85 from source downloaded from before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mentioned site. And here starts the real fun part.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Where is gdk-pixbuf? I have installed all thinkable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imlib, gtk and gnome development packages from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; frozen Potato, but gdk-pixbuf is nowhere to be seen.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I finally went out and got it from ftp.gnome.org
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and compiled and installed it myself.
</EM><BR>
<P>IIRC, this is going to be part of GNOME 1.2, which is currently at 1.1.90, i.e.
<BR>
not quite stable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What's up with libart? In /usr/include/libart_lgpl/include
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there is supposed to be a libart.h. It isn't there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I put it there myself by using a version of it I found
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on cvs.gnome.org. I did a cut and paste from that, only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to find that the include files were included in incorret
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; order.
</EM><BR>
<P>The libart-dev package has all of the header files, static libs, .so symlink,
<BR>
etc.  In general, if you have a lib but can't build something that depends on
<BR>
it, get the lib's -dev package.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; After a few testruns I managed to arrange them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in an order that worked, at least for Dia.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then came libxml... Latest stable realse of libxml from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ftp.gnome.org is 1.8.7. They even have a libxml2-* there!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What is the version available with potato? libxml-dev
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from Debian is 1.8.2. Dia 0.85 required 1.8.5. I deinstalled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1.8.2 and compiled and installed 1.8.7 by hand.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not sure but I'd guess this is time lag due to the freezes leading up to the
<BR>
test cycle.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I was now finally able to compile and install Dia 0.85.
</EM><BR>
<P>Congratulations!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However, this experince has left me with some questions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How up to date is Potato? Can this be explained by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fact that Potato has entered into a test cycle and is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not beeing updated during this period? Or is this the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expected state of this Debian release and I can look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forward to more of the same?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think the best answer is probably that Debian stable has very high quality
<BR>
requirements, so packages should be tested for a while before being put into a
<BR>
stable distribution.  A few packages in alpha or beta stages might get in if
<BR>
there are no alternatives, e.g. GNOME 0.3 in slink, and of course the &quot;0.&quot; in
<BR>
dia's version indicates a not-quite-stable release.
<BR>
<P>But something as profound as a change from imlib1 to gdk-pixbuf, which didn't
<BR>
make it into the last releases of GNOME 1.0 and which would affect a large
<BR>
number of packages, is not quite well-enough tested for Debian stable (though
<BR>
don't quote me- you'll have to ask the Debian GNOME maintainers for the reason
<BR>
for not including this particular package).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I was thinking about Woody, but I was told that when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Debian said unstable, they ment unstable (i.e. someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; told me that at one point, even the gcc shipped with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Woody didn't work). Also, I do appreciate stability,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and Potato has been a dream so far. But I would like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to see it kept up to date a little better than this.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then you'll probably appreciate the &quot;package pool&quot; system under
<BR>
discussion/development, which would create sets of packages which go through
<BR>
testing before being added to stable, so for example if GNOME 1.2 is released in
<BR>
a month, the package pool might hit Debian stable in two or so.  Just
<BR>
speculation, but early package pools might include the 2.4 kernel, X 4.0,
<BR>
mozilla 1.0, etc.
<BR>
<P>This system is being developed to meet exactly the need you articulate here.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I switched to Debian in the first place because I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impressed by the package system and the fact that so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many maintainers are working to give us the best at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all times. However, had the Dia package been up to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; date (the rest of course had to be updated first)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I wouldn't have had to go trough this. And installing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software by hand like this defeats the whole point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wiht Debian's ingenious package and update system.
</EM><BR>
<P>Another possibility is to build Debian source packages from Woody, on your
<BR>
Potato system.  To do this, add deb-src lines to your /etc/apt/sources.list in
<BR>
the same format as the deb lines, do &quot;apt-get update&quot; and &quot;apt-get source
<BR>
*pkgname*&quot;.  Then cd to the directory it creates and type &quot;debian/rules build&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Most of the woody packages should build on potato, but if there's a dependency
<BR>
on, say, a new glibc, then you're out of luck.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Basically, I would like some pointers from the once
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who have used Debian for some time. I need to know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how much of the same I can expect. Also I would like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to know the difference between Slink, Potato and Woody
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with respect to how fast they are updated with new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; versions.
</EM><BR>
<P>Slink: stable, almost never.
<BR>
Potato: frozen and in testing, no updates until the test cycle is done, then
<BR>
security fixes and other very important things.
<BR>
Woody: whenever the maintainers put something new in. :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Btw: Could someone tell me where the source for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;procinfo&quot; is to be found? It gives me the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; floating point exception as gFTP did, so I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thinking to try to compile that too with -mieee.
</EM><BR>
<P>You should be able to &quot;apt-get source&quot; with the binary or source package name to
<BR>
get the source.  How to find the binary package name?  If you have it installed:
<BR>
<P>dpkg -S `which procinfo`
<BR>
<P>Otherwise:
<BR>
<P>wget <A HREF="http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/potato/Contents-alpha.gz">http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/potato/Contents-alpha.gz</A>
<BR>
zcat Contents-alpha.gz | grep procinfo
<BR>
<P>Looks like sysutils.
<BR>
<P>Zeen,
<BR>
<P>-Adam P.
