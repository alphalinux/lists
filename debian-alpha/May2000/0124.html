<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Thank you for the hints I received on my little problem (see below)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; posted recently. The main outcome is as follows: the only machine where 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it actually occurred was the one where I've found it: faure.debian.org. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On lully.debian.org, which has quite the same libraries and compiler installed, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it did not occur. On the machines of those who kindly supported me, the problem 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; did not occur either. So for myself, I will just ignore this problem.
</EM><BR>
<P>faure is an EV4, lully is EV6.  The FPU is substantially different on
<BR>
the later generations of Alphas.  EV6 has precise exceptions as well
<BR>
as some extra instructions, and (I believe) implements more operations
<BR>
in hardware.
<BR>
<P>The possibilities are either:
<BR>
<P>1) EV4 is trapping whereas EV6 is not.
<BR>
2) Both are trapping, but the trap is not handled correctly on EV4.
<BR>
<P>Either way, you are triggering a bug in the kernel's floating-point
<BR>
completion handler on faure, but not on lully.
<BR>
<P>What is probably more relevant is that faure is running Linux 2.2.9
<BR>
and lully (as well as the machines I tested and failed to verify this
<BR>
code on) is running 2.2.15 or thereabouts.  There have been several
<BR>
fixes to the FP completion code since 2.2.9.
<BR>
<P>I'm pretty sure this is a bug in the older kernel.
<BR>
