<P><EM>&gt; sparc has seperate dynamic loaders for 32 and 64 bit code. AFAIK, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't load 64bit from a 32bit program, atleast not on sparc. Which is why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we have gotten Wichert to use objdump (and hopefully soon I can convert
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; him to readelf) in order to get library deps for dpkg-shlibdeps.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, I didn't know that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; #define ELFCLASS32      1               /* 32-bit objects */
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; #define ELFCLASS64      2               /* 64-bit objects */
</EM><BR>
<P>As we discussed on IRC, these constants don't have anything to do with
<BR>
what's in ld.so.cache.  (Just wanted to repeat that for the record :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is this even used? Did you check that Joel was actually applying the patch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the rules file? I know he has some stubs for 64bit sparc, but none of
</EM><BR>
<P>It's certainly not applied on Alpha ... no idea about for Sparc.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I haven't looked at what is done for alpha, powerpc, or ia64, but I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see anything that is specific to sparc in the way it handles 32/64 bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hybrid caches in glibc 2.2 CVS.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah.  My feeling is that the bug isn't really in ldconfig but rather
<BR>
in the dynamic loader, which should ignore the 32/64 bit flags on
<BR>
Alpha.
<BR>
<P>Of course those flags (as they pertain to ld.so.cache) should actually
<BR>
be well-defined first, which they currently aren't as of ld.so 1.9.11
<BR>
and glibc 2.1.3.  But from what you said on IRC it seems that they
<BR>
will be in glibc 2.2, once ldconfig has been moved into the glibc
<BR>
source.
<BR>
<P>Cheers (and please correct me if I'm wrong)
