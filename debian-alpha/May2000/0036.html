<P>
That makes absolutly no sense.
<BR>
Even if the bios is set to &quot;srm&quot; you would still get to the &quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot; prompt.
<BR>
And also, you are confusing srm console with &quot;set console serial&quot; if the srm
<BR>
console is set to serial then you will need a vt100 or what ever (laptop
<BR>
with hyperterminal).
<BR>
<P>But believe me &quot;SRM&quot; does not require a terminal if &quot;console&quot; is set to
<BR>
&quot;graphic&quot; or &quot;both&quot;.

<P><P>Sounds like your system is set up to use the SRM bootup. Problem is the only
<BR>
way you can see what is going on with SRM, so as to configure your system,
<BR>
is to plug an old VT-100 console into the system's serial port (or use
<BR>
another machine's VT100 console and have a null-modem serial cable plugged
<BR>
into the alpha and other machine). *SRM does not display through the
<BR>
system's video card* !!
<BR>
<P>My eb164 was using the NT ARC, which gives a nice blue startup console
<BR>
through the video card, when through monkey-inquisitiveness I changed it to
<BR>
SRM console. Luckily one of the unix guys at work had a VT100 console, and
<BR>
it didn't take me *too* long to figure out if it was using 7,8 bits, the
<BR>
parity settings, etc so I could switch it back to NT ARC.
<BR>
<P>Read through the following to get an idea of what is going on:
<BR>
<P>at <A HREF="http://www.alphalinux.org,">http://www.alphalinux.org,</A> read the following links:
<BR>
<P>MILO howto (<A HREF="http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/milo.html">http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/milo.html</A>)
<BR>
SRM howto (<A HREF="http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/srm.html">http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/srm.html</A>)
<BR>
and possibly AlphaBIOS howto

(<A HREF="http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/alphabios-howto.html">http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/alphabios-howto.html</A>).
<BR>
<P>good luck !

<P><P>Hello,
<BR>
<P>I have recently bought a UP1000 (known also as
<BR>
Nautilus) m/b with a 21264-600 processor.
<BR>
<P>Problem is that the bloody thing won't boot.  When you
<BR>
turn the power on, the led's on the board light up,
<BR>
the hard drive whirls a bit then stops, then nothing! 
<BR>
No data to the monitor, no beeps to say &quot;no os here&quot;.
<BR>
NOTHING!!!
<BR>
<P>I have taken care with the installation, and the video
<BR>
card is fine (matrox G400).  This is driving me mad!
<BR>
<P>Can anyone out there please offer some advice to a
<BR>
person who has spent a considerable amount of money,
<BR>
and with little to show for it.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
<P>Robert Martinovic
