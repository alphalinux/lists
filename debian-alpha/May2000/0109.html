Hey,
<BR>
<P>I have some experinces to share with you and I would
<BR>
like som feedback on this.
<BR>
<P>It all started when I wanted to install Dia
<BR>
(<A HREF="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~alla/dia/dia.html">http://www.lysator.liu.se/~alla/dia/dia.html</A>)
<BR>
The version for Potato/Alpha is currently 0.83, while
<BR>
Dia is out in 0.85. I tought nothing of this and installed
<BR>
0.83 by using apt. However, there were some things from
<BR>
0.85 that weren't present in 0.83, so I decided to go ahead
<BR>
and install 0.85 from source downloaded from before
<BR>
mentioned site. And here starts the real fun part.
<BR>
<P>Where is gdk-pixbuf? I have installed all thinkable
<BR>
imlib, gtk and gnome development packages from the
<BR>
frozen Potato, but gdk-pixbuf is nowhere to be seen.
<BR>
I finally went out and got it from ftp.gnome.org
<BR>
and compiled and installed it myself.
<BR>
<P>What's up with libart? In /usr/include/libart_lgpl/include
<BR>
there is supposed to be a libart.h. It isn't there.
<BR>
I put it there myself by using a version of it I found
<BR>
on cvs.gnome.org. I did a cut and paste from that, only
<BR>
to find that the include files were included in incorret
<BR>
order. After a few testruns I managed to arrange them
<BR>
in an order that worked, at least for Dia.
<BR>
<P>Then came libxml... Latest stable realse of libxml from
<BR>
ftp.gnome.org is 1.8.7. They even have a libxml2-* there!
<BR>
What is the version available with potato? libxml-dev 
<BR>
from Debian is 1.8.2. Dia 0.85 required 1.8.5. I deinstalled
<BR>
1.8.2 and compiled and installed 1.8.7 by hand.
<BR>
<P>I was now finally able to compile and install Dia 0.85.
<BR>
<P>However, this experince has left me with some questions.
<BR>
How up to date is Potato? Can this be explained by the
<BR>
fact that Potato has entered into a test cycle and is
<BR>
not beeing updated during this period? Or is this the
<BR>
expected state of this Debian release and I can look
<BR>
forward to more of the same?
<BR>
<P>I was thinking about Woody, but I was told that when
<BR>
Debian said unstable, they ment unstable (i.e. someone
<BR>
told me that at one point, even the gcc shipped with
<BR>
Woody didn't work). Also, I do appreciate stability,
<BR>
and Potato has been a dream so far. But I would like
<BR>
to see it kept up to date a little better than this.
<BR>
<P>I switched to Debian in the first place because I was
<BR>
impressed by the package system and the fact that so
<BR>
many maintainers are working to give us the best at
<BR>
all times. However, had the Dia package been up to
<BR>
date (the rest of course had to be updated first)
<BR>
I wouldn't have had to go trough this. And installing
<BR>
software by hand like this defeats the whole point
<BR>
wiht Debian's ingenious package and update system.
<BR>
<P>Basically, I would like some pointers from the once
<BR>
who have used Debian for some time. I need to know
<BR>
how much of the same I can expect. Also I would like
<BR>
to know the difference between Slink, Potato and Woody
<BR>
with respect to how fast they are updated with new
<BR>
versions.
<BR>
<P>Btw: Could someone tell me where the source for
<BR>
&quot;procinfo&quot; is to be found? It gives me the same
<BR>
floating point exception as gFTP did, so I was
<BR>
thinking to try to compile that too with -mieee.
<BR>
