Hello,
<BR>
<P>I just switched from RedHat to Debian (Potato). I'm haveing a little 
<BR>
trouble ajusting, but I'm sure I will get used to it in time.
<BR>
<P>One thing I noticed is that gFTP 2.0.6a seg. faults with a floating 
<BR>
point error. The same thing happened when I tried to compile gFTP 
<BR>
2.0.6a manually and then run it a while back on RH 6.0. 
<BR>
<P>The same gFTP version from RedHat, available in RH 6.2, does not have 
<BR>
this problem. 
<BR>
<P>I also experinced the exact same problem with 2.0.4. If compiled 
<BR>
manually, it would seg. fault with a floating point error, if installed 
<BR>
from RPM from RedHat, it would work just fine.
<BR>
<P>Is RH applying some kind of patch that Debian, and indeed the public 
<BR>
in general, doesn't know about?
<BR>
<P>I tried running the RH version on Debian (I've kept the old RH installation 
<BR>
on a seperate disk), and it worked like a charm. 
<BR>
<P>I've also seen several messages here about ldconfig. The ldconfig that
<BR>
was installed with Potato isn't doing it's job. It simply doesn't work.
<BR>
I tried running the ldconfig I had available from RH, and it worked just 
<BR>
like it should. I know there is work in progress to fix this, but this
<BR>
would indicate that someone has allready fixed it a long time ago for RedHat.
<BR>
I've never had any problems with the ldconfigs from RH, and that includes 
<BR>
those shipped with RH 4.2, 5.2, 6.0 and 6.2.
<BR>
<P>My system is a 164LX with a 533MHz 21164a.
<BR>

<BR>
<P><P>PS: Is there a mailing list for general questions for people new to 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debian (not new to Linux though)?
