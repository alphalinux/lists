<P>
Greetings,
<BR>
<P>Finally got around to testing the potato boot floppies with
<BR>
console=ttyS0.  I'm using the potato boot floppies 2.2.13 from 5/4.
<BR>
<P>First problem: the tulip and old_tulip modules don't install in modconf,
<BR>
says &quot;Device or resource busy&quot;.  On reboot, there was something about
<BR>
eth0, de4x5.c which seems to indicate tulip is built in to the kernel.
<BR>
So if this is built in, it should not also be a module, right?
<BR>
<P>Second: In dbootstrap, the &quot;Make Linux bootable from hard drive&quot; step
<BR>
looks for milo on the floppy in a file named eb164, instead of lx164.
<BR>
When it isn't found, there's no way to &quot;Cancel&quot; back to the dbootstrap
<BR>
main menu, it infinite loops between &quot;put in the floppy&quot; and &quot;can't find
<BR>
eb164&quot; dialogs.  (The workaround is easy, just &quot;cd /floppy; cp lx164
<BR>
eb164&quot; on a separate machine, reinsert and we're good, but there should
<BR>
be a way to break out of the dialogs, right?)
<BR>
<P>Third: Escaped to a shell for finishing touches needed for serial
<BR>
console.  /etc/securetty came with ttyS0, which is cool.  But when I
<BR>
tried to edit inittab using ae (vi doesn't fit on the boot floppies),
<BR>
there was a problem:
<BR>
<P>S-Lang Error: Unknown Error Code
<BR>
SLcurses_initscr: init failed
<BR>
<P>then the # prompt, but only ^C key does anything, and it looks like it
<BR>
LFs without CR, no other response to the keyboard.  So I had to hard
<BR>
reboot, without unmounting...
<BR>
<P>On the bright side: during the initial install, everything came up well
<BR>
on LX164 with serial console, using &quot;console=ttyS0&quot;.  In fact, my old
<BR>
Tex 4207 used as console couldn't handle the vt220 (?) commands in the
<BR>
Slink startup, so it filled the screen with errors; potato is 1000% more
<BR>
readable!
<BR>
<P>However, after rebooting (with no change to /etc/inittab), it reverts to
<BR>
vt220 (?), so the screen is filled with errors and I can't read
<BR>
anything, I'm guessing the questions and typing blind.  It seems
<BR>
&quot;configure the base system&quot; has detected that I'm on a serial console,
<BR>
and modified inittab accordingly to run:
<BR>
<P>&quot;dpkg-reconfigure debian-base &lt; /dev/ttyS0 &gt; /dev/ttyS0
<BR>
<P>Brilliant!  But if you're going to go to the trouble to make dbootstrap
<BR>
vt100-friendly, and inittab.real start up in a vt100-friendly way, well,
<BR>
could it be possible to perform this step in such a way too?.
<BR>
<P>Much worse though, escape is now somehow trapped by the serial driver,
<BR>
so when I force it to run vi (like, &quot;Edit apt sources by hand&quot;), I can't
<BR>
do anything.  ^C, ^Z, nothing works, I can't get out, I'm paralyzed, so
<BR>
I hard reboot.  But even though I set the root password and new user
<BR>
name last time around, the potato installer comes up anyway.  I can't
<BR>
edit anything, anywhere, I can't finish installing...
<BR>
<P>Akha!  I reboot with the rescue milo/floppy/root, execute a shell, and
<BR>
copy inittab.real to inittab; this has also been intelligently
<BR>
configured to start getty on /dev/ttyS0 with vt102, so it comes up very
<BR>
nicely on my machine.  Cool!
<BR>
<P>I run dpkg-reconfigure debian-base, and I'm installed.
<BR>
<P>These little problems are small, and perhaps specific to my particular
<BR>
system, and nothing compared to the great strides with which this has
<BR>
advanced beyond the Slink install.  I hope the problems can be fixed,
<BR>
but in the meantime, congratulations on a terrific installation system!
<BR>
