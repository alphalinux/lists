<EM>&gt; Well, I didn't even get to file a bug report and patch to ld.so before

<EM>&gt; the new package was uploaded, and I spent several hours today tracking

<P>I figured the bug was serious enough that I wanted to revert the

<P><EM>&gt;  c) We have a patch for our libc on Sparc that has its own version of

</EM><BR>
<P>Why doesn't anyone ever send me these patches?  Anyway, I still should

have double checked that I was using the same flag as RedHat.

<P><EM>&gt; The Sparc people should probably sit down and figure out a good way to

<EM>&gt; do all this that won't break other archs.

<P>Agreed.
