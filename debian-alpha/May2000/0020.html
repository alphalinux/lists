<P>Not too much going on here.  The only script that runs enables
<BR>
ip_forwarding, some redirection, and everything else is open.  This is
<BR>
the script after removing the boilerplate (start|stop):
<BR>
<P># (Dis)Allow forwarding
<BR>
echo $FORWARD &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
<BR>
<P># Set the default policy
<BR>
iptables -P FORWARD $POLICY
<BR>
<P># Only llama can make it out port 80 safely
<BR>
iptables -$RULING PREROUTING -t nat -p tcp --dport 80 --src llama -j
<BR>
ACCEPT
<BR>
<P># All others get redirected to the squid on llama
<BR>
iptables -$RULING PREROUTING -t nat -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to
<BR>
$SQUID
<BR>
<P># We can also redirect external requests into our cache
<BR>
iptables -$RULING PREROUTING -t nat -p tcp --dport 3128 -j DNAT --to
<BR>
$SQUID
<BR>
<P># Masquerade all connections
<BR>
iptables -$RULING POSTROUTING -t nat -j MASQUERADE
<BR>
<P><P>Network traffic is pretty light, and the machine will crash near eny
<BR>
time; high, low, no load or network traffic.  The error, for me, is in
<BR>
the SCSI driver, but sometimes also manifests itself on the PCI bus
<BR>
(lost interrupt).
<BR>
<P>I've replaced nearly every component in the system with a third box I
<BR>
have to no avail.  The third box was running RedHat flawlessly until the
<BR>
power supply died.  Everything that was in there has been moved into the
<BR>
existing box, with the exception of a floppy drive which was salvaged
<BR>
for the currently running RedHat box, as the one that was in the
<BR>
replacement was dead.
<BR>
<P>I've also played with the SCSI chain to no avail - with external
<BR>
termination, without termination, without the bracket present at all. 
<BR>
All had no effect on the crashing.
<BR>
<P>It this point it boils down to two potential problems:  The PCI ethernet
<BR>
card, and the internal hard drive.  I'm currently running kernel
<BR>
2.3.99-pre6.3 (2.3.99-pre5 is BROKEN) and have the same problems as with
<BR>
the debian kernel, and my other custom kernels from 2.2.12 - 2.2.14.  I
<BR>
believe the ethernet card should be functioning fine, as I think it was
<BR>
used in one of these before.
<BR>
<P>So I guess the question is: Do you have an internal hard drive?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; After checking around on the kernel lists/NFS howtos etc it seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the way forward might be to try the kernel nfs daemon, knfsd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instead of the nfs-server package. I was wondering if anyone has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had much success with this on an Alpha and whether its up to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; running on a production machine? Any other ideas would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appreciated..
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm using NFS from RedHat 5.2 without incident.  Usage has been light to
<BR>
non-existant as of late, but now that I have autofs working from NIS it
<BR>
will be much higher.  They seem to be using rpc.nfsd as the nfs server -
<BR>
&quot;ps auwx | grep nfs&quot; shows only it running, and &quot;locate knfs&quot; gives me a
<BR>
single file from the kernel sources.
<BR>
<P>I'm running a custom 2.2.14 kernel on this box (same kernel as on the
<BR>
box that crashes constantly, before the 2.3.99-pre6.3 upgrade).
