<P>Thank you for your reply. It cleared up a lot of things for me, and I'm
<BR>
left with a better feeling of how the package and distribution cycle work
<BR>
for the different versions of Debian.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Where is gdk-pixbuf? I have installed all thinkable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; imlib, gtk and gnome development packages from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; frozen Potato, but gdk-pixbuf is nowhere to be seen.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; I finally went out and got it from ftp.gnome.org
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; and compiled and installed it myself.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;IIRC, this is going to be part of GNOME 1.2, which is currently at 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;1.1.90, i.e.not quite stable.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's true that gdk-pixbuf was to be found only in the &quot;unstable&quot; branch
<BR>
of the GNOME source tree, but there was a directory for it in the &quot;stable&quot;
<BR>
branch refering to the unstable versions.
<BR>
<P>However, I do see your point. It's not stable so it has no place
<BR>
in Potato. On the other hand, who ever compiled Dia had to have
<BR>
it installed. And shouldn't the users have the possibilty to install
<BR>
all development packages needed to compile the other Debian packages?
<BR>
It's a little like &quot;No, this development package is not stable so we 
<BR>
won't include it in this stable realse. But hey, here go right ahead and 
<BR>
get this stable package I compiled with it.&quot; I almost feel that any package 
<BR>
requering gdk-pixbuf should also have been taken out of Potato if it's 
<BR>
so unsafe to trust users with it in a stable version.
<BR>
<P>That didn't come out quite right, but I hope you understand what I mean.
<BR>
If they can deliver programs for the stable version that requires
<BR>
gdk-pixbuf to compile, what reasons do they have for saying gdk-pibuf
<BR>
itself isn't stable enough to be included?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The libart-dev package has all of the header files, static libs, .so symlink,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; etc.  In general, if you have a lib but can't build something that depends on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it, get the lib's -dev package.
</EM><BR>
<P>I did. I installed libart-dev, but that doesn't install libart.h, which
<BR>
I'm quite sure is supposed to be part of that exact pacakge. I even removed
<BR>
it and reinstalled it to make sure no mistakes or errors had crept into
<BR>
the installation of it.
<BR>
