Hi -
<BR>
<P>We've just moved our Solaris file server over to an Alpha box
<BR>
running the potato release. Other than a few teething problems
<BR>
(that were to be expected) everything seemed to be fine until
<BR>
last week. The server froze completely and had to be rebooted. On
<BR>
reboot their were no messages in the system logs that point to
<BR>
any nasty errors that could have caused the problem. I put this
<BR>
down to running X with an old SVGA card that may not actually be
<BR>
supported by the Alpha (Permedia 2) that eventually caused the
<BR>
freeze.
<BR>
<P>However, this week cvs/ssh/samba requests started to block. After
<BR>
checking on the server the only thing that could point to this
<BR>
was a lot of 'NFS: task XXXX can't get request slot' messages in
<BR>
the logs (some of the cvs roots/home drives etc are served via
<BR>
NFS). The network load appears to be normal and the server itself
<BR>
was fairly idle. Once these messages start occuring the server
<BR>
seems to go off on a spiral of death and can only be resurrected
<BR>
by a reboot.
<BR>
<P>After checking around on the kernel lists/NFS howtos etc it seems
<BR>
that the way forward might be to try the kernel nfs daemon, knfsd
<BR>
instead of the nfs-server package. I was wondering if anyone has
<BR>
had much success with this on an Alpha and whether its up to
<BR>
running on a production machine? Any other ideas would be
<BR>
appreciated..
<BR>
<P>Thanks
<BR>
<P>Marcus
