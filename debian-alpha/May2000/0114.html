<EM>&gt; Thank you for your reply. It cleared up a lot of things for me, and I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; left with a better feeling of how the package and distribution cycle work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the different versions of Debian.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; Where is gdk-pixbuf? I have installed all thinkable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; imlib, gtk and gnome development packages from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; frozen Potato, but gdk-pixbuf is nowhere to be seen.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; I finally went out and got it from ftp.gnome.org
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; and compiled and installed it myself.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;IIRC, this is going to be part of GNOME 1.2, which is currently at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;1.1.90, i.e.not quite stable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's true that gdk-pixbuf was to be found only in the &quot;unstable&quot; branch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the GNOME source tree, but there was a directory for it in the &quot;stable&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; branch refering to the unstable versions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, I do see your point. It's not stable so it has no place
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in Potato. On the other hand, who ever compiled Dia had to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it installed. And shouldn't the users have the possibilty to install
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all development packages needed to compile the other Debian packages?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's a little like &quot;No, this development package is not stable so we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; won't include it in this stable realse. But hey, here go right ahead and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get this stable package I compiled with it.&quot; I almost feel that any package
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; requering gdk-pixbuf should also have been taken out of Potato if it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so unsafe to trust users with it in a stable version.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That didn't come out quite right, but I hope you understand what I mean.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If they can deliver programs for the stable version that requires
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gdk-pixbuf to compile, what reasons do they have for saying gdk-pibuf
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; itself isn't stable enough to be included?
</EM><BR>
<P>I just did &quot;apt-get source --build dia&quot; and it worked, configure checked for imlib
<BR>
and not for gdk-pixbuf, so the latter is *not* needed for the version of dia which
<BR>
ships with potato.
<BR>
<P>Maybe that's why 0.83 is the potato version, because newer ones require
<BR>
gdk-pixbuf.  In any case, you have all you need to build the shipping version.
<BR>
For newer stuff, I'm afraid you'll have to wait for the woody packages.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The libart-dev package has all of the header files, static libs, .so symlink,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; etc.  In general, if you have a lib but can't build something that depends on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it, get the lib's -dev package.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I did. I installed libart-dev, but that doesn't install libart.h, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm quite sure is supposed to be part of that exact pacakge. I even removed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it and reinstalled it to make sure no mistakes or errors had crept into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the installation of it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Look at that, you're right, libart.h is not in any of the debian/*.files files in
<BR>
the gnome-libs source package.
<BR>
<P>I would guess this file is new to the 1.2 GNOME release... ?
<BR>
<P>In any case, once again, it is not required to build dia 0.83.
<BR>
<P>Hope this helps,
<BR>
<P>-Adam P.
