<EM>&gt; Well, I didn't even get to file a bug report and patch to ld.so before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the new package was uploaded, and I spent several hours today tracking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the problem, too.  I guess I should get into the habit of tracking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incoming for this sort of thing.  It sure would be nice if (a) the BTS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were faster, and (b) people would copy bug reports to the appropriate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mailing lists so as to avoid duplication of effort.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anyway, regarding the LIB_ELF64 flag:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  a) It's only relevant to architectures that have a single dynamic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     loader that handles both 32 and 64 bit libraries (currently Sparc,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     maybe also PowerPC in the future, but definitely not Alpha or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     IA-64, ever)
</EM><BR>
<P>sparc has seperate dynamic loaders for 32 and 64 bit code. AFAIK, you
<BR>
can't load 64bit from a 32bit program, atleast not on sparc. Which is why
<BR>
we have gotten Wichert to use objdump (and hopefully soon I can convert
<BR>
him to readelf) in order to get library deps for dpkg-shlibdeps.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  b) It's not handled at all by the current ld-linux.so code.  In fact,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     ld-linux.so has LIB_ELF and LIB_ELF_LIBC6 as magic numbers in its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     cache searching code (line 203,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     glibc-2.1.3/sysdeps/generic/dl-cache.c in the glibc source tree):
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	  if ((flags == 1 || flags == 3)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	      &amp;&amp; cache-&gt;libs[middle].value &lt; cachesize - sizeof *cache)
</EM><BR>
<P>This is completely different from glibc 2.2 CVS. Debian/SPARC wont be
<BR>
using 64bit until 2.2 is released, so I suggest checking into that. From
<BR>
elf/elf.h in glibc CVS:
<BR>
<P>#define ELFCLASS32      1               /* 32-bit objects */
<BR>
#define ELFCLASS64      2               /* 64-bit objects */
<BR>
<P>This appears to be pretty generic (and further down there are SPARC
<BR>
specific things). I'm not too familiar with this, so I'm not sure I'm on
<BR>
the same track as you are.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  c) We have a patch for our libc on Sparc that has its own version of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     ldconfig, and this version of ldconfig uses a *different* flag to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     indicate ELF64 libraries (debian/patches/ldconfig.dpatch in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     glibc source tree):
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; +#define FLAG_ANY		-1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; +#define FLAG_TYPE_MASK		0x00ff
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; +#define FLAG_LIBC4		0x0000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; +#define FLAG_ELF		0x0001
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; +#define FLAG_ELF_LIBC5		0x0002
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; +#define FLAG_ELF_LIBC6		0x0003
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; +#define FLAG_REQUIRED_MASK	0xff00
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; +#define FLAG_SPARC_LIB64	0x0100
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;                                 ^^^^^^
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It would be nice to have some consistency between the various things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that read and write the ld.so.cache (and no more magic numbers).  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way that ldconfig.dpatch does things looks to be more correct to me,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but it also constitutes a backwards-incompatible change to the cache
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; format and so not only do we have to coordinate a fix to glibc but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also the upgrade needs to be handled carefully.
</EM><BR>
<P>Is this even used? Did you check that Joel was actually applying the patch
<BR>
in the rules file? I know he has some stubs for 64bit sparc, but none of
<BR>
it is being used yet, AFAIK. Also note that Debian/SPARC currently has 0
<BR>
64bit support in userspace, so the cache wont be non-compatible, because
<BR>
there should be 0 entries anyway. Plus, the ldconfig on Debian systems
<BR>
still comes from ldso package, so glibc's patches shouldn't matter.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The Sparc people should probably sit down and figure out a good way to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do all this that won't break other archs.
</EM><BR>
<P>I haven't looked at what is done for alpha, powerpc, or ia64, but I don't
<BR>
see anything that is specific to sparc in the way it handles 32/64 bit
<BR>
hybrid caches in glibc 2.2 CVS.
