<P><P><EM>&gt; Pick up a 2.2 kernel (try 2.2.11...works nice on an SX -- I just booted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.2.12 today and it seems to be nice as well).  There were some funky time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problems with earlier kernels on the SX.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem was with 2.2.7. I hadn't realized that there's a system
<BR>
option in make menuconfig and had compiled it for generic alpha. I
<BR>
think it's working well now; also I've grabbed the clock binary from
<BR>
gatekeeper because the debian-supplied hwclock doesn't work.
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; In either case, let me know what you find if you decide to play with it a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bit.  I'd be happy to spin a new upload if it needs it and can get a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; working patch.  Without the hardware to test it here, I'm hesitant to even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; look at it.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I said, I'm a bit loaded in the moment, but otoh I can sleep better 
<BR>
when I have fresh backups. let's see...
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Hehehehe...yeah, it's kind of ugly getting these things up.  To make it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worse, there's SOOOOO many different types of Alphas that no one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; HOWTO seems to cover it.  I currently know two methods (ARC and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AlphaBIOS), but SRM is foreign to me (and I've been on Alpha for years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now).  Regarding the booting off of the hard drive, it can be a pain with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the SX's.  They seem to not be able to recognise any drives that are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hooked up to my Tekram SCSI board, so I had to add a small IDE drive to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; run MILO from.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, that's not my problem. The NCR-based controller is recognized just 
<BR>
fine; the BIOS has trouble reading floppies and thus I cannot upgrade.
<BR>
Milo can only see secondary partitions and the BIOS, MILO and the
<BR>
kernel all have different ideas about the numbering of partitions.
<BR>
Once I had figured out to make a dos partition for booting, I had
<BR>
success installing milo there (the install process didn't mention this 
<BR>
detail to my knowledge because the drive was already partitioned from
<BR>
the previous i386 installation). Still, milo can show the contents of
<BR>
that partition with ls, but when trying to boot from there, it
<BR>
complains about invalid gzip format. The very same kernel image boots
<BR>
fine from the second drive. The difference between the two drives is,
<BR>
that the first one got partitioned by cfdisk during install (I
<BR>
selected that from the install menu; else the install had used the
<BR>
partitions which were already there) and the second drive is
<BR>
partitioned with fdisk under i386. Milo also was successful booting
<BR>
from a ZIP connected to the same controller and formatted with the
<BR>
BIOS' format utility.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; We plan on working on docs a bit more.  Unfortunately, most of us are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; better programmers (and workaholics) than we are at documenting things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;g&gt;.  I'll note the suggestions, though, and see if we can improve things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the people who are totally new to Alpha.  To be fair, the main Debian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; install doc is REALLY lacking as far as good installation instructions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The README that Loic generated with the boot disks is far better and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably should be more prominant on the CDs.
</EM><BR>
<P>Just because my memory is still fresh:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;o  the hint that one must ignore the BIOS' warning about invalid boot
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;options should be repeated or made more prominent, imho. I simply
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overlooked it and then spent almost a full day searching for newer
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BIOS images and trying to install one which lets me boot the way I
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thought to be correct.
<BR>
&nbsp;o  there might be a hint to ignore the kernel's request for a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ram-disk image on floppy when installing from CD. When I had
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;created the floppies (I had made two sets before disassembling my
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;old machine) and booted the machine, it kept asking for a floppy
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but as long as I gave it floppies it always crashed.
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; Hm, I was more looking for something like &quot;unpack the source with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; dpkg-source, then do/don't edit the files in place...&quot; or maybe give some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; special switches to one of the dpkg tools to get a binary with debug
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; information in it and the like. Well, I'll look into the dpkg
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; documentation as time permits.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Oh, sorry :-)  Best way is to unpack it with dpkg-source, edit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; debian/rules and remove any reference to strip.  That will keep all of the
</EM><BR>
<P>[man strip...] Yup, that was the one I was missing. Thanks for the
<BR>
hint (and of course for all the work you put into this system). 
<BR>
<P><P>kind REgards,
