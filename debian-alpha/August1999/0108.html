<P><EM>&gt; - the `man' command seems to sleep about 3-5 seconds before displaying

<EM>&gt;   anything. In fact, `strace' shows that there is an explicit delay of 1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   second, implemented by a select() call without any FDs to check for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   (this indicates that it's not waiting for anything, it is really an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   explicit sleep).  My research indicates that this probably happens in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   gdbm_close() (in libc?). I don't have the libc sources handy (hi Chris!)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   so I couldn't verify this. libc 6.12.1.2-0pre6 and man-db 2.3.10-69i.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll look into this.  glibc-2.1.2-pre07 is installed in master now, which
<BR>
might fix this...I'll check it regardless.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - the alignment trap from identd is back (that was fixed, I'm sure).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Ah yes, I had fixed it in 3.07-7.1.slink.1, this is from the changelog
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   I did then:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   * non-maintainer fix reimplemented YET AGAIN (see bug #30366).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Doing a sourceful NMU this time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   * changed the version numbering as otherwise it was considered a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     downgrade; there was already a nonmaintainer upload due to the above,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     and apparently 3.07-7slink.1 &lt; 3.07-7.1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Looks like time for another sourceful NMU (current version is 3.07-7.2)
</EM><BR>
<P>I noticed this the other day.  Shall I rebuild it or do you want to?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - the `file' command sometimes gives &quot;lseek: invalid argument&quot;. However,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   I can't reproduce this now... `strace' showed that it was passing some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   gigantic number as the offset.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's odd.  I never had this happen.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Besides these it actually all looks pretty good ;-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BTW: I haven't been paying that much attention to the build process
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lately. I gather there's now an autobuilder? How does one proceed when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wanting to attack the diff list?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, right now, the autobuilder is down due to some connectivity problems
<BR>
that John is having apparently, so the list is once again free game.  I've
<BR>
been building around 40-50 packages a day, though, so it should be in
<BR>
decent shape.  There's quite a bit of work still left, though, since alot
<BR>
of the packages have problems with the new gcc/g++.
