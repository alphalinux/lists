<EM>&gt; &gt; - the alignment trap from identd is back (that was fixed, I'm sure).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   Ah yes, I had fixed it in 3.07-7.1.slink.1, this is from the changelog
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   I did then:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   * non-maintainer fix reimplemented YET AGAIN (see bug #30366).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     Doing a sourceful NMU this time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   * changed the version numbering as otherwise it was considered a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     downgrade; there was already a nonmaintainer upload due to the above,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     and apparently 3.07-7slink.1 &lt; 3.07-7.1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   Looks like time for another sourceful NMU (current version is 3.07-7.2)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I noticed this the other day.  Shall I rebuild it or do you want to?
</EM><BR>
<P>It seems I may not have much time in the near future; my ISDN line to my
<BR>
home is dead, and as I'm not there mon-fri I don't know whether there's
<BR>
just a telco problem, or whether I have more damage at home (apparently
<BR>
a heavy thunderstorm passed over Monday night). I'm going home this
<BR>
evening to check things out. Otherwise I would have done it tonight.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; - the `file' command sometimes gives &quot;lseek: invalid argument&quot;. However,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   I can't reproduce this now... `strace' showed that it was passing some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   gigantic number as the offset.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's odd.  I never had this happen.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll try to keep an eye out for this. Damn elusive :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Well, right now, the autobuilder is down due to some connectivity problems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that John is having apparently, so the list is once again free game.  I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been building around 40-50 packages a day, though, so it should be in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decent shape.  There's quite a bit of work still left, though, since alot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the packages have problems with the new gcc/g++.
</EM><BR>
<P>Any suggestions on what I could concentrate on? Anything that won't
<BR>
build due to non-portable programming that I could tackle?
