<P><EM>&gt; &gt; There's still the Problem, that milo which gets loaded from a small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; dos partition on the first drive refuses to load any kernel from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; first drive. (second drive, floppy, CD and ZIP all work with any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; filesystem on them but trying to boot from the first drive [all SCSI]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it complains about invalid gzip format)
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I had the same problem with an older milo (compiled for 2.0.32),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; updating to the one from the rescuedisk solved it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think upgrading MILO helped... I used the one from the CD
<BR>
first (the rescue-disk image appears to be ext2 and I still cannot
<BR>
reliably read any floppies) and then grabbed one from gatekeeper (I
<BR>
think, that's where I got it from.) neither of which will read from
<BR>
the first hard disk. I'm not entirely sure which of the MILOs I have
<BR>
right now, since I swapped back and forth several times, at any rate,
<BR>
I have a version that doesn't accept partition names as commands (the
<BR>
other one I had, would just change it's working directory to the
<BR>
partition if a partition name was given as command).
<BR>
For the moment, this is rather low in my scheduler queue since I have
<BR>
to do my thesis and then want to fix taper (I've already narrowed the
<BR>
problem to a function but I don't understand the code yet) before
<BR>
looking at the boot oddies again. After all, one doesn't have to spend 
<BR>
all that much time booting the machine because it's Linux :-)
<BR>
<P>kind Regards,
