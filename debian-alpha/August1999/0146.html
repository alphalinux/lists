<P><EM>&gt; &gt; xawtv: the v4l-conf utility as well as xawtv-remote are not in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;        binary package. They compiled from the source (the source
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;        package contains intel binaries, btw) and work well, so I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;        think they have simply got lost in the packaging process.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is this slink or potato?  If it's potato, I can always recompile it, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the compile finished flawlessly and appeared to have everything in there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when I compiled it circa last week.  As far as slink goes...I can look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into it but am not sure how quickly I can get a replacement into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; archive.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's slink. The source package compiles without problem after the
<BR>
intel binaries have been removed. Also, the make process complained
<BR>
about some bogus time-stamps which may well be due to the hwclock
<BR>
problem on SX164 that hit me during installation (hey, great system,
<BR>
checks itself for Y2K conformance prior to installation ;-))
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Both emacs20 and xemacs20 are true headaches to compile on Alpha (I won't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even go into emacs19).  EGCS always had problems compiling both and, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make matters worse, xemacs has MANY source problems involved (emacs20 has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some newer code which xemacs doesn't...code that's needed for better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; portability).  Right now, neither package is compiling at all on Alpha in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; potato, so again, this may be a problem that's not easily solved on our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; level.  I've been working on it here and there, but haven't had the time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to really figure out why it doesn't work properly.
</EM><BR>
<P>So I think, I'll stay with the binary that I have and eventually get
<BR>
the sources for 21.X from xemacs.org. There was a discussion about the 
<BR>
alpha issue on comp.emacs.xemacs a few weeks(months?) ago, and it
<BR>
seems the authors are aware of the problem. For the moment, I cannot
<BR>
afford spending major amounts of time on this because I have to get my 
<BR>
thesis out (the main reason I bought a faster machine in the first
<BR>
place).
<BR>
I was just curious because the Mule stuff adds even more complexity in 
<BR>
that one cannot be sure whether a buffer has one or more bytes per
<BR>
character. I never understood why mule was integrated to tightly into
<BR>
emacs but that's a different story...
<BR>
<P><P>[afbackup]
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Wish I ran it so I can figure out what's wrong with this.  It is probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; related to the size of some of our types versus the Intel.  In other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; words, this is probably a 32-bit-&gt;64-bit issue.  I'll look at the afbackup
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in potato and see if there's anything obviously troublesome in there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'll also dig up the slink source and look for problems in there.
</EM><BR>
<P>I was just curious. I've found that the source packages are really easy 
<BR>
to install and so I thought maybe this package has just been compiled
<BR>
and uploaded since the compilation went well... It seems the packaging 
<BR>
system adds a surprising amount of ad-hoc portability but of course it 
<BR>
cannot fix broken source code. After all, a client-server solution is
<BR>
maybe a bit of overkill for a single user machine, so I'll try to dig
<BR>
up the old taper sources. 
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MILO is currently not easily packaged.  It won't compile on it's own with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; glibc and 2.2 kernels.  I suppose we could always make a binary package,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but since MILO needs to be installed on a DOS partition, floppy, or CD, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be kind of moot to install it into an ext2 partition like a normal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Debian package.  Believe me, I went back and forth about this with another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; developer for awhile, but neither of us came up with an easy way to handle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it or implement the installation.
</EM><BR>
<P>given the fact that I had zero experience with alphas last week, I'm
<BR>
doing quite well now. One of the nastier things during installation,
<BR>
however, was the fact that I couldn't get this machine to boot from
<BR>
hard disk. Once the system was up, I felt rather nervous about
<BR>
rebooting without a few spare floppies with milo and a kernel image on 
<BR>
them.  Also, the complete documentation somewhere in /usr/doc would
<BR>
have been helpful because after disassembling my machine and plugging
<BR>
the alpha in, my room was a complete mess and thus having to search
<BR>
the floor for the HOWTOs that i had printed led to some inexact
<BR>
language :-)
<BR>
Maybe the milo binaries are not necessary to have (or even nonsensical 
<BR>
at the point where the system runs) but the docs should be there. When 
<BR>
the system runs for the first time, one can still have a hard time
<BR>
figuring out how to make it start next time. It would be even better
<BR>
if there was a readme.exe on the installation CD, that could be
<BR>
started from the BIOS. 
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; Look for the obvious: pointer-&gt;int conversions (pointers are 8 bytes, ints
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are 4 bytes), assumed type sizes (where the code obviously assumes longs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are 4 bytes like on Intel, for instance), and such.  A good starting point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is to compile the package using the -Werror or  -Wall switches to gcc and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; log the compilation.  -Werror will abort compilation if it generates a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; warning (sometimes unavoidable...I would use -Wall, which should warn you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of all kinds of anomalies).  Then go back and look into the warnings.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hm, I was more looking for something like &quot;unpack the source with
<BR>
dpkg-source, then do/don't edit the files in place...&quot; or maybe give some
<BR>
special switches to one of the dpkg tools to get a binary with debug
<BR>
information in it and the like. Well, I'll look into the dpkg
<BR>
documentation as time permits.
<BR>
