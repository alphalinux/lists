<EM>&gt; I'm totally new to the Alpha world and i'm actually trying to install an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha distribution (Debian 2.1) on a new ES40 (4-way EV6).
</EM><BR>
<P>Wow!  I haven't even seen one of those things :-)  Must be nice!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The problem is that I don't even get to some sort of boot prompt.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm...I'm not sure anyone's even attempted to install Debian on an ES40
<BR>
yet, so the problem is most likely the kernel on the boot disk....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; At this point, no kernel is even loaded, and I've had no chance to give
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some parameters to the bootloader, so this is a very strange behavior.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've tried to copy one of the boot images from the CDROM (the generic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one, as I don't understand a thing to Alpha architectures) on a floppy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and had exactly the same behavior.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm...it's probably not booting because there is not support for the
<BR>
ES40 in the generic kernels on the CD.  You may require a hand-spun boot
<BR>
disk.  What kind of hardware is installed in your machine?  I'll check
<BR>
with the person who generates the Debian boot floppies for Alpha and see
<BR>
if he can give me some help on this one (not having booted from SRM, I'm
<BR>
a little lost here).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Port of Debian is very poorly documented, and because the ES40 are very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recent computers, I've found nothing about them on any web site/mailing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; list/newsgroup.
</EM><BR>
<P>Very true about our documentation.  Efforts are being made to
<BR>
de-Intel-centrify the docs, but they're slow going and the lack of any
<BR>
newer machines within the core Alpha team hurts our abilities to
<BR>
properly document installation on those machines (why is it that it
<BR>
seems that RedHat gets new machines easily before manufacture and we
<BR>
have to buy them...).
