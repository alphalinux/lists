<P>Hehehehehe...I second that! :-)

<P><EM>&gt; Well, I don't think so. Because I don't even get to a kernel loader. I should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; end with an &quot;aboot&gt;&quot; prompt, and I only have a lonely 'a' on one line.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I suppose that this lonely 'a' is just the beginning of &quot;aboot&gt;&quot;, but maybe I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wrong.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is aboot like LILO on Linux/Intel ? Does the letters have a meaning ? (like :
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;if it's stopped on a, this means that...&quot;).
</EM><BR>
<P>Not that I know of.  I can recompile aboot for you that's optimised for an
<BR>
EV6, but don't know how much that's going to do for you.  I'll poke around
<BR>
for a new version of aboot or some patches for it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I know that when I'll get to this boot prompt, I'll probably have lots of other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problems with the kernel, but for now, I would just like to have this prompt :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok.  I'll look around.  I have a few sources for such things.
