<EM>&gt; &gt; OK, I finally got round to trying the dreaded upgrade :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; After manually upgrading libc6.1 and a couple of related things,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I let &quot;apt-get upgrade&quot; do its thing. I repeated a couple of times
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (I have no idea why it kept stuff back; after &quot;apt-get install
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; random-package&quot; from the list of kept-back stuff it went on and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; installed a couple of others, etc.  I then tries &quot;apt-get dist-upgrade&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which went a lot further.
</EM><BR>
<P>I forgot to mention that a couple of times, random processes crashed
<BR>
during package installations (e.g. gzip segfaulting). Redoing that
<BR>
package then worked just fine.  This is the same thing I noticed when
<BR>
installing the AS1000A 5/333 some time ago; I blamed it on flaky memory
<BR>
then, but now I think that maybe the installation kernels for slink were
<BR>
compiled with a buggy compiler? I *know* my hardware is stable, as it
<BR>
was running 2.0.37-pre-something for 70 days before I rebooted (compiled
<BR>
with egcs 1.03's cc1, no alpha patches in the kernel whatsoever).
<BR>
<P>Maybe something went wrong during the installation which caused the
<BR>
problems I had...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Glad to hear that it went relatively smoothly.  From what I hear, even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; i386 upgrades are ugly still.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I didn't have any problems when I updated a test i386 box from slink
<BR>
to unstable a month ago...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; (BTW, wwwoffle has a hardcoded dependency on libc6 :-(  )
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'll take care of this tonight or tomorrow.
</EM><BR>
<P>I had started to do this, but then noticed that when I did &quot;debchange
<BR>
-n&quot;, the date was Jan 4, 1970&quot; ... Which triggered this thread ;-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I don't dare to run the updated stuff for the time being; can e.g. Chris
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or Bart shed some light on this?  Is perhaps a 2.2 kernel mandatory?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Definitely go to a 2.2 kernel.  If it isn't a requirement, it should be.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I just booted with 2.2.11 and all seems well.  If it gets hosed for you,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boot with 2.2.7 or 2.2.5 (2.2.8-2.2.10 had problems including file system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corruption and spontaneous thread death).
</EM><BR>
<P>Shhh. Don't tell my box at work:
<BR>
$ uname -r
<BR>
2.2.9-ac3
<BR>
$ uptime
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2:20pm  up 66 days,  1:38,  3 users,  load average: 1.00, 1.00, 1.00
<BR>
<P>In case you're wondering about the load:
<BR>
<P>$ ps aux | grep seti
<BR>
paul     29091 99.9 21.5 14504 13652  ?  R N Jun 23 69767:44 ./setiathome -email
<BR>
<P><P>Anyway, I'll give 2.2.11 a try; with my floppy patch, sent to Alan Cox
<BR>
today, it got into 2.0.37 but not into 2.2.x last time.  I also sent it
<BR>
to Linus for 2.3.x.
