jmd decided to waste my bandwidth saying:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I got a Multia from Linuxstore.com today. I was trying to set it up and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see what I had to work with. I powered up fine, right into SRM and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything seemed fine. I have 64M memory, show showed ethernet and scsi
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at id7. There are no drives connected to the scsi, ide or floppy drives.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I decided to change to the ARC console (I have a Cabriolet board and I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comfortable here) and I typed in arc at the SRM prompt. I waited for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; while and nothing happened. I powered down and powered up. Nothing came
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up on the screen. I remembered the extra battery, installed it and now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when I power up I get to: &quot;Initializing firmware... then &quot;Initializing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Device Drivers  NCRC810&quot; at this point it stops. I let it sit like this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for 10mins. Nothing?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have upgraded the firmware on both of my Multias but the version
<BR>
install'd seem'd to work fine... I just decided to go against the rule of
<BR>
thumb (ie - If it ain't broke don't fix it)...
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did learn that if the firmware can't read the keyboard or display
<BR>
to the monitor it will redirect out to the serial port... They explain how
<BR>
to how it up to serial on another machine and get into the system bios but
<BR>
I was lucky and removing the battery for awhile clear'd it up so I could
<BR>
fix the problem...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Did I hose the ROM by powering down? Any ideas would be appreciated.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Another hardware question... can I use any 44 pin laptop IDE cable for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 2.5 Seagate drive that came with it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm... I tried an 2.5 IDE drive and it wouldn't work... Slap'd a 2.5
<BR>
SCSI drive and it works perfectly... I did not the machine wouldn't even 
<BR>
boot if the IDE drive was install'd... Of course I didn't get the 2.5 drive
<BR>
that linuxstore or cpumicromart sold... I just got a standard 340MB SCSI 2.5
<BR>
drive... Works like a champ...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respectfully,
<BR>
