<P><EM>&gt; xawtv: the v4l-conf utility as well as xawtv-remote are not in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        binary package. They compiled from the source (the source
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        package contains intel binaries, btw) and work well, so I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        think they have simply got lost in the packaging process.
</EM><BR>
<P>Is this slink or potato?  If it's potato, I can always recompile it, but
<BR>
the compile finished flawlessly and appeared to have everything in there
<BR>
when I compiled it circa last week.  As far as slink goes...I can look
<BR>
into it but am not sure how quickly I can get a replacement into the
<BR>
archive.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; xemacs20 : is there any particular reason that there's no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        xemacs20-nomule binary package? I failed to compile myself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        because I don't have all the required library headers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        installed, but I guess, I'm not the only one using xemacs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        without mule. I'd appreciate pointers to pre-compiled binaries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        but also will try to get it compiled from source unless someone 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        tells me that it has severe troubles...
</EM><BR>
<P>Both emacs20 and xemacs20 are true headaches to compile on Alpha (I won't
<BR>
even go into emacs19).  EGCS always had problems compiling both and, to
<BR>
make matters worse, xemacs has MANY source problems involved (emacs20 has
<BR>
some newer code which xemacs doesn't...code that's needed for better
<BR>
portability).  Right now, neither package is compiling at all on Alpha in
<BR>
potato, so again, this may be a problem that's not easily solved on our
<BR>
level.  I've been working on it here and there, but haven't had the time
<BR>
to really figure out why it doesn't work properly.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; afbackup: is anyone running afbackup on alpha? I just tried it in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        favour of taper and all I could get was that afclient
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        complained about the server refusing connections. Telnetting to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        the afbckup server on localhost gives an error about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        machine having 8-byte longints or somesuch. (I've already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        erased the package from disk so I don't have the exact wording
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        of that error at hand)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        have I overlooked something?
</EM><BR>
<P>Wish I ran it so I can figure out what's wrong with this.  It is probably
<BR>
related to the size of some of our types versus the Intel.  In other
<BR>
words, this is probably a 32-bit-&gt;64-bit issue.  I'll look at the afbackup
<BR>
in potato and see if there's anything obviously troublesome in there.
<BR>
I'll also dig up the slink source and look for problems in there.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; taper: on my intel box, taper 6.8 used to run nicely (daily backup of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        ~2G system and ~1G user data) while taper 6.9 segfaults. Now,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        I've tried taper 6.9 on alpha and it segfaults too. I really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        don't want to waste too much time with this since last time I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        checked, it was a heisenbug (wouldn't occur when running taper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        in the debugger), so the question is: is there still a taper6.8 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        binary or source package anywhere?
</EM><BR>
<P>I may have one, but will have to look.  I keep all kinds of arcane stuff
<BR>
:-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; milo:  any particular reason for not including a milo package into the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        main distribution? 
</EM><BR>
<P>MILO is currently not easily packaged.  It won't compile on it's own with
<BR>
glibc and 2.2 kernels.  I suppose we could always make a binary package,
<BR>
but since MILO needs to be installed on a DOS partition, floppy, or CD, it
<BR>
would be kind of moot to install it into an ext2 partition like a normal
<BR>
Debian package.  Believe me, I went back and forth about this with another
<BR>
developer for awhile, but neither of us came up with an easy way to handle
<BR>
it or implement the installation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Don't get me wrong: I _am_ deeply impressed by the ease of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installation (after having wrestled the stupid BIOS, that is) and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; degree of stability of Debian. I am ready to look into some problems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; myself but I can use a guiding hand sometimes. If there is some quick
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guide to debugging source packages, I'd highly appreciate that. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Look for the obvious: pointer-&gt;int conversions (pointers are 8 bytes, ints
<BR>
are 4 bytes), assumed type sizes (where the code obviously assumes longs
<BR>
are 4 bytes like on Intel, for instance), and such.  A good starting point
<BR>
is to compile the package using the -Werror or  -Wall switches to gcc and
<BR>
log the compilation.  -Werror will abort compilation if it generates a
<BR>
warning (sometimes unavoidable...I would use -Wall, which should warn you
<BR>
of all kinds of anomalies).  Then go back and look into the warnings.
<BR>
<P>Good luck.  If you need any further help, please don't hesitate to ask me
<BR>
or the list...
