<P>
I have a Multia UDB here that is running slink.  I'd like to be able to run 
<BR>
ssh and some of the other non-US programs on it, but there is no 
<BR>
'binary-alpha' directory.
<BR>
<P>I had the bright idea of trying to compile ssh myself, but it seems that I 
<BR>
need libraries that aren't available either.  So, I need to upgrade to 
<BR>
potato so I can run SSL-enabled programs.
<BR>
<P>Last time I tried to update my system to potato, the clock went all screwy 
<BR>
on me, and I had to wipe and reinstall slink.  I upgraded to potato before 
<BR>
I had the 2.2 kernel installed.  I also had to use a different MILO than 
<BR>
the one included on the boot diskette for slink.
<BR>
<P>My question boils down to this:  What do I need to do to make sure that the 
<BR>
clock continues to work right, and doesn't decide it's January 
<BR>
1970?  Should I make sure I have a certain version of MILO, or did my 
<BR>
previous problem come from using potato binaries with the 2.0.36 stock kernel?
<BR>
<P>Thank you,
<BR>
Shawn
