<EM>&gt; It'll have to wait till the weekend then.  Rescue disks, fdisk, mkfs are some

<P>Sorry about that.  The new bash package was installed into master today,
<BR>
so it should be available now, fyi.  Currently, we're not working on new
<BR>
boot disks until things settle on the i386 side a bit.  Also, since John's
<BR>
autobuilder is offline right now, most of us have been tied up compiling
<BR>
packages like crazy leaving little time to address upgrade issues (alot of
<BR>
the new packages being compiled are changes that would facilitate
<BR>
upgrades, fyi).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'll let people know how it goed for reference too.  (btw, how many people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have done *clean* upgrades from a 100% slink dist to potato ?)
</EM><BR>
<P>I haven't done it since we released slink (seems like ages ago now).  In
<BR>
fact, I think I was the first to convert since I traditionally am the one
<BR>
who compiles our libc and gcc packages and always test them locally first 
<BR>
:-)
