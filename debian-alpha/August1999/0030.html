<EM>&gt; only because I was working on some stuff for the then-upcoming potato
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; devel cycle).  Also, be aware that there are some problems with 2.2.9 on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some systems.  You'll definitely have to acquire the Alan Cox patches for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that kernel (believe me, you'll be better off), but I've found that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything beyond 2.2.7 somehow screws with my ability to compiler larger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; programmes (including the kernel).  Work is still being done on fixing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this, but it only seems to occur on some types of Alphas (SX is definitely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; affected, I can vouch for that).  If you can live with 2.2.5, I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recommend it over 2.2.9 any day of the week.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just for a data point, I grabbed the source to 2.2.9 off of
<BR>
ftp.us.kernel.org and complied it on my XLT alpha. I then then rebooted
<BR>
with the new kernel, and never had a problem. I even recompiled the 2.2.9
<BR>
kernel this afternoon to add nbd and md/raid support, and had no problems
<BR>
in the compile at all. The new kernel booted fine, and everything is
<BR>
working fine, including nbd and raid!
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guess I just got lucky... What were Alan Cox's patches supposed to
<BR>
do? I didn't go for 2.2.10 because I had heard on debian-user that 2.2.10
<BR>
had a filesystem corruption bug. Oh, the fun of new stable kernels and
<BR>
trying to figure out which one is best. :)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case anyone is interested in why I upgraded (other than just
<BR>
for the sake of doing so)... I was on 2.0.35, and was having scsi
<BR>
subsystem unstablities (with single ncr controller, three disks and a
<BR>
tape), and got worse when I recently added a storage array for a total of
<BR>
two controllers (ncr + aha2940), seven disk, three CD-ROM drives, and one
<BR>
tape. So far 2.2.9, seems to be handle everything much better than 2.0.35
<BR>
could.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, 2.2.9 is not a lost cause for all Alphas, just some it
<BR>
appears. Oh, I am running stock Debian 2.1 on my XLT 366. TTYL.
