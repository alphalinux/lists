<EM>&gt; Alpha architecture is being released with slink, as far as I know.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, it is not included in slink on non-US.debian.org.  :-(

<P>Unfortunately there's really nothing I can do at this late stage.  The
<BR>
non-US archive is being maintained by the same people that maintain
<BR>
the main archive only in the last few months.  From now on, we'll be
<BR>
freezing and releasing both archives concurrently.
<BR>
<P>In the mean time, you alpha users will have to get your non-US
<BR>
packages from unstable.
<BR>
<P>If you'd like to reply, be sure and cc me as I don't read
<BR>
debian-alpha.
