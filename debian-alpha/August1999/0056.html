OK, I finally got round to trying the dreaded upgrade :-)
<BR>
After manually upgrading libc6.1 and a couple of related things,
<BR>
I let &quot;apt-get upgrade&quot; do its thing. I repeated a couple of times
<BR>
(I have no idea why it kept stuff back; after &quot;apt-get install
<BR>
random-package&quot; from the list of kept-back stuff it went on and
<BR>
installed a couple of others, etc.  I then tries &quot;apt-get dist-upgrade&quot;
<BR>
which went a lot further.
<BR>
<P>(BTW, wwwoffle has a hardcoded dependency on libc6 :-(  )
<BR>
<P>Then, suddenly, I noticed that the system time seemed to be bouncing
<BR>
around in January 1970 !  Repeated invocations of &quot;date&quot; showed Jan 1,
<BR>
Jan 6, Jan 2, Jan 4, ....
<BR>
What was wierder is that I touched a file, &quot;ls -l file&quot; also showed a
<BR>
Jan 1970 date!  And now (after rebooting from my backup root :-), it's
<BR>
showing an Aug 12 1999 date again !?
<BR>
<P>I tried this with the kernel on slink's boot floppies (I used that for
<BR>
installing, as I thought that that kernel probably had the symlink chown
<BR>
patches in; am I correct?).  Rebooting with vanilla 2.0.37-pre7 (which
<BR>
had an uptime of 70 days before this) also showed this strange date
<BR>
behaviour. When I chrooted into my backup root partition, &quot;date&quot; gave
<BR>
the correct answer. So, something in libc6 is screwed?
<BR>
<P>I don't dare to run the updated stuff for the time being; can e.g. Chris
<BR>
or Bart shed some light on this?  Is perhaps a 2.2 kernel mandatory?
<BR>
