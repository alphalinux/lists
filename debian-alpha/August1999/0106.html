Since I have a working 2.2 kernel (and hence a working potato [hmm, that
<BR>
sounds strange :-] ), I've been trying a couple of things last night.
<BR>
<P>- the `man' command seems to sleep about 3-5 seconds before displaying
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;anything. In fact, `strace' shows that there is an explicit delay of 1
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;second, implemented by a select() call without any FDs to check for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(this indicates that it's not waiting for anything, it is really an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;explicit sleep).  My research indicates that this probably happens in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;gdbm_close() (in libc?). I don't have the libc sources handy (hi Chris!)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;so I couldn't verify this. libc 6.12.1.2-0pre6 and man-db 2.3.10-69i.
<BR>
<P>- the alignment trap from identd is back (that was fixed, I'm sure).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah yes, I had fixed it in 3.07-7.1.slink.1, this is from the changelog
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I did then:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* non-maintainer fix reimplemented YET AGAIN (see bug #30366).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing a sourceful NMU this time.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* changed the version numbering as otherwise it was considered a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;downgrade; there was already a nonmaintainer upload due to the above,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and apparently 3.07-7slink.1 &lt; 3.07-7.1
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks like time for another sourceful NMU (current version is 3.07-7.2)
<BR>
<P>- the `file' command sometimes gives &quot;lseek: invalid argument&quot;. However,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't reproduce this now... `strace' showed that it was passing some
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;gigantic number as the offset.
<BR>
<P>Besides these it actually all looks pretty good ;-)
<BR>
<P>BTW: I haven't been paying that much attention to the build process
<BR>
lately. I gather there's now an autobuilder? How does one proceed when
<BR>
wanting to attack the diff list?
