<P><EM>&gt; It's slink. The source package compiles without problem after the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intel binaries have been removed. Also, the make process complained
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about some bogus time-stamps which may well be due to the hwclock
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem on SX164 that hit me during installation (hey, great system,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; checks itself for Y2K conformance prior to installation ;-))
</EM><BR>
<P>Pick up a 2.2 kernel (try 2.2.11...works nice on an SX -- I just booted
<BR>
2.2.12 today and it seems to be nice as well).  There were some funky time
<BR>
problems with earlier kernels on the SX.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So I think, I'll stay with the binary that I have and eventually get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the sources for 21.X from xemacs.org. There was a discussion about the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alpha issue on comp.emacs.xemacs a few weeks(months?) ago, and it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seems the authors are aware of the problem. For the moment, I cannot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; afford spending major amounts of time on this because I have to get my 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thesis out (the main reason I bought a faster machine in the first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; place).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I was just curious because the Mule stuff adds even more complexity in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that one cannot be sure whether a buffer has one or more bytes per
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; character. I never understood why mule was integrated to tightly into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; emacs but that's a different story...
</EM><BR>
<P>It's being extricated by the Debian maintainer, though :-)  He's got
<BR>
access to a build Alpha to play with and is working on the problem as
<BR>
well, so hopefully, once he returns from holiday, he'll be able to get us
<BR>
a working package.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I was just curious. I've found that the source packages are really easy 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to install and so I thought maybe this package has just been compiled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and uploaded since the compilation went well... It seems the packaging 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system adds a surprising amount of ad-hoc portability but of course it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cannot fix broken source code. After all, a client-server solution is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maybe a bit of overkill for a single user machine, so I'll try to dig
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up the old taper sources. 
</EM><BR>
<P>In either case, let me know what you find if you decide to play with it a
<BR>
bit.  I'd be happy to spin a new upload if it needs it and can get a
<BR>
working patch.  Without the hardware to test it here, I'm hesitant to even
<BR>
look at it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; given the fact that I had zero experience with alphas last week, I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doing quite well now. One of the nastier things during installation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; however, was the fact that I couldn't get this machine to boot from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hard disk. Once the system was up, I felt rather nervous about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rebooting without a few spare floppies with milo and a kernel image on 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them.  Also, the complete documentation somewhere in /usr/doc would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have been helpful because after disassembling my machine and plugging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the alpha in, my room was a complete mess and thus having to search
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the floor for the HOWTOs that i had printed led to some inexact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; language :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Hehehehe...yeah, it's kind of ugly getting these things up.  To make it
<BR>
worse, there's SOOOOO many different types of Alphas that no one
<BR>
HOWTO seems to cover it.  I currently know two methods (ARC and
<BR>
AlphaBIOS), but SRM is foreign to me (and I've been on Alpha for years
<BR>
now).  Regarding the booting off of the hard drive, it can be a pain with
<BR>
the SX's.  They seem to not be able to recognise any drives that are
<BR>
hooked up to my Tekram SCSI board, so I had to add a small IDE drive to
<BR>
run MILO from.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Maybe the milo binaries are not necessary to have (or even nonsensical 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at the point where the system runs) but the docs should be there. When 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the system runs for the first time, one can still have a hard time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; figuring out how to make it start next time. It would be even better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if there was a readme.exe on the installation CD, that could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; started from the BIOS. 
</EM><BR>
<P>We plan on working on docs a bit more.  Unfortunately, most of us are
<BR>
better programmers (and workaholics) than we are at documenting things
<BR>
&lt;g&gt;.  I'll note the suggestions, though, and see if we can improve things
<BR>
for the people who are totally new to Alpha.  To be fair, the main Debian
<BR>
install doc is REALLY lacking as far as good installation instructions.
<BR>
The README that Loic generated with the boot disks is far better and
<BR>
probably should be more prominant on the CDs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Hm, I was more looking for something like &quot;unpack the source with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dpkg-source, then do/don't edit the files in place...&quot; or maybe give some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; special switches to one of the dpkg tools to get a binary with debug
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information in it and the like. Well, I'll look into the dpkg
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; documentation as time permits.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, sorry :-)  Best way is to unpack it with dpkg-source, edit
<BR>
debian/rules and remove any reference to strip.  That will keep all of the
<BR>
symbols in there.  From there, it's just a matter of figuring out how to
<BR>
add -g to the CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS (usually can be done easily if they use a
<BR>
configure script).  After you figure out that (I can give more detail
<BR>
depending on the method of configuration and/or compilation
<BR>
involved...there's too many to generalise or elaborate on here), install
<BR>
the debs and have a go with gdb.
