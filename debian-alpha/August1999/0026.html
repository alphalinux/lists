<P><EM>&gt; Hey everybody.  I've got Debian 2.1 with the 2.0.35 kernel (just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installed) and I'm trying to update the kernel to 2.2.9.  I read in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; readme for 2.2.9 that I needed several other things updated before I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should update the kernel.  One of these others said I needed an updated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; version.h to install properly and suggested I update to kernel 2.1.x.  Is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there an easy way to get to 2.2.9 without going through 2.1.x first?  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you hadn't guess, no I haven't done this before.
</EM><BR>
<P>There's no need to go through 2.1.x at all (I ran 2.1.x for awhile, but
<BR>
only because I was working on some stuff for the then-upcoming potato
<BR>
devel cycle).  Also, be aware that there are some problems with 2.2.9 on
<BR>
some systems.  You'll definitely have to acquire the Alan Cox patches for
<BR>
that kernel (believe me, you'll be better off), but I've found that
<BR>
anything beyond 2.2.7 somehow screws with my ability to compiler larger
<BR>
programmes (including the kernel).  Work is still being done on fixing
<BR>
this, but it only seems to occur on some types of Alphas (SX is definitely
<BR>
affected, I can vouch for that).  If you can live with 2.2.5, I would
<BR>
recommend it over 2.2.9 any day of the week.
<BR>
<P>Regarding the tools, binaries, or other files needed when upgrading, I
<BR>
don't *recall* needing anything special at all.  In fact, I ran 2.2.1
<BR>
while working on slink (aka Debian 2.1) without needing anything else at
<BR>
all.
