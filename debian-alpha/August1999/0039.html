Note sure how helpful I can be here, but just thinking aloud...

<P>True, I ran into this problem when installing on an AS1000A 5/333.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However, we've only got SRM, no ARC.  And no DOS or WinDoze.
</EM><BR>
<P>Same.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This is our first Alpha install, we've done several 2.0 and 2.1 on i386.
</EM><BR>
<P>I had the luck of having done a couple of installs previously. But then,
<BR>
I had the bad luck that www.alphalinux.org was down that weekend :-(
<BR>
(there's a certain amount of benefit from being able to access that
<BR>
site while doing something like this).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; We have a CD-ROM and TLZ07 DAT tape on the system.  We don't know from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; our reading exactly what &quot;aboot&quot; is, but we can get to its prompt if we

<P>aboot is a boot loader for alpha linux, just like syslinux or lilo is
<BR>
for i386 linux. There's also milo, but that doesn't work on all alpha's
<BR>
or certain combinations of alpha and srm etc. So sometimes you need
<BR>
aboot, other times you need milo. If you're lucky you can choose which
<BR>
one you use...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; dd the Avanti resc1440.bin to a tape and boot from it.  When we try to

<P>Cool! Booting alphalinux from tape...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; specify the kernel at the prompt, using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boot/avanti/{linux|milo|loadlin.exe} root=/dev/scd0 load_ramdisk=1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it will try to load the specified file, first as plain, then as compressed,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and error off with &quot;unzip:  unknown compression method&quot;, and puts us 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; back at the aboot prompt.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think the problem here is that aboot tries to read the medium it's
<BR>
booted from in a random access way, and that probably fails on tape.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Does anyone know where we've managed to lose the track?  FWIW, we've also:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Tried copying milo.dd to tape (wrong length error message at boot)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Tried a straight boot from dka100, the CD-ROM device (no boot image found)
</EM><BR>
<P>Where did you get the cdrom? I had managed to build one that had
<BR>
successfully undergone the &quot;markisoboot&quot; (or whatever it's called)
<BR>
treatment, so that aboot is on it at the right place, and aboot can find
<BR>
the root image.
<BR>
<P>On the AS1000A I ended up always booting from cdrom, as the disks were
<BR>
connected to an Adaptec controller that isn't recognized by srm;
<BR>
connecting a disk to the native controller didn't work because then srm
<BR>
didn't get past its scsi probe :-(
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; dd'ing milo to a spare drive on the system, but couldn't write to the raw device
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm, on the AS1000A milo isn't supported.
<BR>
<P>But if you have a spare disk it should be doable! Do you mean you
<BR>
couldn't write to the raw device from within Digital Unix? That sounds
<BR>
strange...
