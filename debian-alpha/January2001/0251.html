Hi,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've gotten to the point where I'm thinking of selling my Alpha. Why?
</EM><BR>
<P>Honestly, who doesn't from time to time ;-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; * Mozilla doesn't compile (anything after M17)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * Support for Matrox Dual Head is so far non-existant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * Kernel 2.4.1 DOES NOT WORK ON UP1000 using the Debian method - the other 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   method I haven't tried
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * Do I need to keep going.
</EM><BR>
<P>It really depends, on what you do, as you'll most likely know anyway. If the above
<BR>
issues are really critical to you, maybe you should ask yourself, why you chose the
<BR>
Alpha in the first place.
<BR>
<P>Unless someone has *very specific* reasons to do so, you should chose a PC. It's
<BR>
cheaper, quite fast, stable ( if you spend on quality ) and far better supported than
<BR>
Alpha ( and everybody else's arch ).
<BR>
That's not a secret at all, and honestly, noone will question that. Speaking on my behalf, I
<BR>
use the Alpha for the following reasons:
<BR>
<P>- True 64Bit arch, as I do need the process size and the memory size.
<BR>
- Clean design, which allows debugging at machine-code level without the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cruft of the x86 machine-code 
<BR>
- Performance issues, like FP and memory Bus.
<BR>
- easy and reliable HW config.
<BR>
<P>I do, however, use a PC for various reasons. First of all, the PC is my X-Terminal
<BR>
containing 4 GFX cards in a X 4.0.1 multihead setup. Second, the PC contains
<BR>
some devices, which I'd rather not see in my main Alpha ( like sound, USB, CD-writer and
<BR>
the like ), although most of them would work there.
<BR>
<P>I know, my setup requires some extra $$$ to realize, but it suits me very well, and, since
<BR>
i need my Alpha for the reasons given above, I found it the best possible way.
<BR>
<P>The whole point i making, is, that you should ask yourself, why you use the Alpha. Unless,
<BR>
you need the features this arch provides, you are most certainly better off using a PC.
<BR>
If you need it, you sure hit some constraints, not found on the average PC arch.
<BR>
But as an Linux/Alpha user for over four years now, I didn't find any problem, that could
<BR>
not be solved without my own effort, or with the help of the community. Having source,
<BR>
allows fixing things, or changing them Your Way (TM). For some things, i use a
<BR>
PC, since IMHO this arch suits some apps better then Alpha.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This is not a whine from someone not prepared to help. It is a reflection
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the situation we Alpha users, specifically Debian Alpha users have to deal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with. No support apart from each other and no interest from anybody else.
</EM><BR>
<P>As always, you get what you pay for ;-)
<BR>
I used to build my Linux installation from scratch, using the sources of the Apps/Tools
<BR>
needed. I switched to Debian about 1.5 years ago, since i found it very close to the way,
<BR>
i consider a good Unix system ( which is, what I'm after. Unix. Preferably with source, which
<BR>
Linux and GNU and others provide ). I praise Compaq for the release of their Compilers to
<BR>
the Linux community and their apparently active support for this platform. In effect, I see
<BR>
strong interest in Linux/Alpha from all relevant parties: Manufacturer, Distribution ppl and 
<BR>
arch-depended software ppl ( Kernel, libs, compiler ).
<BR>
As for the Debian community support, I have yet to see a question from me going
<BR>
unanswered on this list. The newsgroups comp.os.linux.alpha and comp.sys.dec provide
<BR>
additional infos, www.alphalinux.org is of great quality and the IRC channel
<BR>
#alphalinux on irc.openprojects.net might eventually evolve to a real-time support
<BR>
platform.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Who here agrees?
</EM><BR>
<P>I *do* see your point. However, some of your points are really not Alpha-specific ( like
<BR>
the need of a good browser, which is IMHO a generic problem on any non-MS platform ).
<BR>
Also, I'm missing your points, that would explain why you chose Alpha anyway.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; And yeah, I've tried fixing everybuddy, but so far no success.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, that's at least the right attitude ;-) Just keep going.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
