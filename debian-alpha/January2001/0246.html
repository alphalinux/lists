<EM>&gt; &gt; * Mozilla doesn't compile (anything after M17)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Really?...well I've been using the RPMs from RedHat (yes, I know it's not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the same as having a .deb, but for him to make these packages it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; must compile) from <A HREF="http://people.redhat.com/blizzard/software/">http://people.redhat.com/blizzard/software/</A>
</EM><BR>
<P>I have been able to compile SOME of the nightly mozilla builds on
<BR>
potato, but not all.
<BR>
<P>Hopefully something will be done about getting a better gcc for us or
<BR>
hopefully gcc 3.0 happens sometime in my life...

<P><EM>&gt; &gt; * Support for Matrox Dual Head is so far non-existant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Last I knew some of the Dual head code is dependant on a binary only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; library from Matrox. How much time have you spent talking to Matrox asking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if they'll port this to Alpha?
</EM><BR>
<P>ah.. last time I checked (and tried) X did dual head on Alpha just
<BR>
fine with a pair of mill II's.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; * Kernel 2.4.1 DOES NOT WORK ON UP1000 using the Debian method - the other method I haven't tried
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;From what I've seen 2.4.1 still has some issues on i386, nevermind a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; non-x86 arch. These things take time as it's a function of developer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resources. How much have you contributed towards the development of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.4? Also, what's the big rush for 2.4, which of it's features must you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have that 2.2 can't provide? I somehow doubt that 2.4 runs perfectly on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; PPC,Sparc etc....as well. I can't speak to the debian packages as I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; running 2.2 on my debian alpha box.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't use nor recommend &quot;the debian method&quot; of making a
<BR>
kernel. Instead I use:
<BR>
make config
<BR>
make boot
<BR>
make modules
<BR>
make modules_install
<BR>
<P>then all you have to do is copy the kernel image and System.map to
<BR>
/boot.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; * Do I need to keep going.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well if they are specific bugs in Debian then I'd say file them in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Debian bug system.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, please do.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; This is not a whine from someone not prepared to help. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It is a reflection on the situation we Alpha users, specifically Debian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Alpha users have to deal with. No support apart from each other and no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; interest from anybody else.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Who are you expecting to be interested? &quot;No support apart from each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other&quot;?? I thought that's what community support was all about. Are you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; saying that you want a phone number to call, someone you can give your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; credit card number to? I'm not trying to be difficult here, but I'm rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; confused by your comments.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm guessing he meant companies releasing products for Alpha
<BR>
Linux. Some do, some don't. Applixware does (did?). 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Who here agrees?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not I, I've found the Debian (and Linux) communities to be quite good at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't agree, but agree with Rich. The few problems we have are
<BR>
usually dumb coding by people and can eventually be fixed. I don't
<BR>
work for redhat, suse, or one of the other commerical distros. I work
<BR>
for Debian and all my time is volunteer. If someone wanted to pay me
<BR>
to work full time on Alpha, I'd be most happy to do so!
