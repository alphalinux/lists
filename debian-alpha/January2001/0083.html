<EM>&gt; However, I was wanting to use aboot and SRM so that way I could play with the

<EM>&gt; 2.4 kernels. Ran into some problems though:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; First, SRM doesn't seem to see my scsi device (it only lists the floppy 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; device):
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;show dev
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dva0.0.0.0.1    DVA0
</EM><BR>
<P>What kind of SCSI are you using that machine and what version of SRM?
<BR>
ARC's BIOS emulator can initialise more types of cards than SRM's can,
<BR>
especially the older versions of SRM.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Second, when I set up a floppy to contain aboot, the following happens:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And then the system is hung at the _ symbol.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Should I just continue to use milo - and is there some version that would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work OK with a 2.4 custom built kernel ?
</EM><BR>
<P>Aboot does work with 2.4.0 kernels (I'm using one right now,
<BR>
in fact...UP2000), so that's not it.  Did you happen to compile that
<BR>
kernel for an ARC/MILO-based configuration, though?  I've often seen
<BR>
aboot choke because I forgot to enable the &quot;Use SRM&quot; question during
<BR>
kernel configuration.  Also, you may want to say 'n' to the question
<BR>
about using a legacy start address towards the end of 'make config'.
<BR>
It really shouldn't matter, but for some reason, it did clear up one
<BR>
odd and sporadic problem that I had on my SX.
<BR>
<P>I'll try to compile a kernel using eb164 as a machine type to see
<BR>
specifically what your options are, but the above is what I can
<BR>
think of off of the top of my head.
