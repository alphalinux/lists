<P><EM>&gt; Most of the packages in Debian-2.2 seem to reflect source code that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was current about a year ago. Many newer packages require glibc-2.2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and xfree86-4.0 (or at least its client libraries). My apologies if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the answers to these questions can be found in some place that should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have been obvious to me, but wasn't.
</EM><BR>
<P>No need to apologise...upgrading is always something to be cautious about
<BR>
:-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Firstly, it appears to me that many packages in the pool/ directories
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are not referenced in the dists/{stable,testing}/ archives, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dists/unstable/main/binary-alpha is completely unpopulated. What is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the significance of this fact? I thought that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dists/{{un,}stable,testing}/ was supposed to become a bunch of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; symlinks referencing the actual pool/ archive.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes and no.  &quot;unstable&quot; is merely a collection of Contents files that
<BR>
reference packages in the pool directory.  Symlinks aren't really
<BR>
necessary and would really convolute things more if they were there.
<BR>
Using &quot;unstable&quot; does work, though, from an apt point of view.  I've
<BR>
upgraded several machines already to unstable with no archive-related
<BR>
problems.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; With regard to glibc, I seem to recall that glibc-2.1 was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; binary-incompatible with glibc-2.0, at least on alpha, and that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had to upgrade the whole system at once or risk major breakage; I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never understood exactly what the issue was. Is this also the case
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with installing glibc-2.2, or is this a more transparent upgrade?  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so, do its associated libraries (for hostname resolution or whatever)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need to be upgraded at the same time?
</EM><BR>
<P>Glibc 2.1 binaries will run on glibc 2.2 (I've yet to find one that
<BR>
doesn't, although some needed to be recompiled due to changes in the NSS
<BR>
code...most were intrinsic to glibc, but a few were base packages).  Glibc
<BR>
2.2 binaries, however, may or may not be downward compatible.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Finally, is it safe to upgrade the client-side part of xfree86 to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4.0.x, while leaving the server at version 3.3.6? What are the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; packages involved, and is there any particular procedure that needs to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be followed because of the major restructuring of xfree86 between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these releases?
</EM><BR>
<P>Ugh...well, upgrading to unstable will upgrade your X libs to 4.0.x
<BR>
versions, but the 3.3.6 X server binaries are compiled against that, so
<BR>
it's a &quot;mixed bag&quot; at that point.  Some of the server binaries from 3.3.6
<BR>
are now gone, having been replaced by the new 4.0.x modularised X server,
<BR>
but that depends on what hardware you have.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I want to upgrade packages like spruce and xfig, because the versions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in Debian-2.2 appear to be buggy, and the newer packages all seem to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have dependencies on more recent dynamic libraries. (Is this for real,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or just an artifact of the build process?) Thanks for any information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on these issues.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's for real.  It's really up to you as to whether or not you want to
<BR>
upgrade.  You could always try rebuilding the packages from the unstable
<BR>
source on a potato system, if you want to avoid the rest of the headaches
<BR>
of upgrading (things sometimes just don't work correctly on
<BR>
&quot;unstable&quot;...hence our recent net-tools problem that's now passed).
