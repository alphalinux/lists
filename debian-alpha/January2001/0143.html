<P>
I've been trying to get a reply regarding install problems on a pc164 from
<BR>
this list for the last couple of week without luck . Can someone at least
<BR>
acknowledge that I'm getting through
<BR>
<P>Thanks.
<BR>
<P>Summary: I can get MILO working no problem but the install fails with
<BR>
either &quot;Cant mount root FS on ...&quot; , &quot;try passing init= to kernel&quot; or
<BR>
&quot;unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address...&quot; These all
<BR>
happen at the point where the ramdisk image is meant to be loaded.
<BR>
<P>I have searched the archives for this list without anything coming to
<BR>
light that has made any real difference :(. 
<BR>
<P>=====
<BR>
<P>Sent this last week with no reply so I'll try again... With additions.
<BR>

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;This reminds me, the current potato boot floppies do NOT work -- problems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with the name of the drivers disks or something like that.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Whomever takes over should look into that problem as soon as possible.
</EM><BR>

<P>Oh great. Now you tell me :-/. I've been banging my head against this
<BR>
pc164 for ages without getting anywhere. 
<BR>
<P>So tell me... what do I need to do to get this beast upwardly mobile? Try
<BR>
to keep it simple please,  I'm not sure I know what I am doing with this
<BR>
:). FYI I can get MILO going ok and the kernel generally loads ok too but
<BR>
when the ramdisk is attempted it will fail [1]. I should also mention that
<BR>
the archive of this list has not been able to help me, though I'm sure the
<BR>
info is in there if I only knew how to extract it, so even just a pointer
<BR>
to where I can find what I need will be useful. 
<BR>
<P>Thanks.
<BR>
<P>[1] I've had mostly failures to mount root fs on... but depending on what
<BR>
parameters I give to MILO I get varying results, All not good. 
<BR>
<P>Working off of 2.2.17 CD and/or 
<BR>
ftp.au.debian.org/pub/debian/dists/potato/main/disks-alpha/current/
<BR>
<P><P>BTW, Ive run into something that I _think_ may have bearing on the matter
<BR>
on the FreeBSD site, vis...
<BR>
<P>Q: I go to boot from the hard disk for the first time after installing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FreeBSD, the kernel loads and probes my hardware, but stops with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;messages like:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;changing root device to wd1s1a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;panic: cannot mount root
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is wrong?  What can I do?
<BR>
<P>Q: What is this 'bios_drive:interface(unit,partition)kernel_name' thing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is displayed with the boot help?
<BR>
<P>A: There is a longstanding problem in the case where the boot disk is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not the first disk in the system.  The BIOS uses a different numbering
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scheme to FreeBSD, and working out which numbers correspond to which
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is difficult to get right.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case where the boot disk is not the first disk in the system,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FreeBSD can need some help finding it.  There are two common situations
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here, and in both of these cases, you need to tell FreeBSD where the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;root filesystem is.  You do this by specifying the BIOS disk number, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the disk type and the FreeBSD disk number for that type.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first situation is where you have two IDE disks, each configured as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the master on their respective IDE busses, and wish to boot FreeBSD
<BR>
from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the second disk.  The BIOS sees these as disk 0 and disk 1, while 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FreeBSD sees them as wd0 and wd2.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FreeBSD is on BIOS disk 1, of type 'wd' and the FreeBSD disk number
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is 2, so you would say:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1:wd(2,a)kernel
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that if you have a slave on the primary bus, the above is not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;necessary (and is effectively wrong).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second situation involves booting from a SCSI disk when you have
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one or more IDE disks in the system.  In this case, the FreeBSD disk
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number is lower than the BIOS disk number.  If you have two IDE disks
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as well as the SCSI disk, the SCSI disk is BIOS disk 2, type 'da' and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FreeBSD disk number 0, so you would say:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2:da(0,a)kernel
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell FreeBSD that you want to boot from BIOS disk 2, which is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the first SCSI disk in the system.  If you only had one IDE disk,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you would use '1:' instead.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you have determined the correct values to use, you can put the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command exactly as you would have typed it in the /boot.config file
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;using a standard text editor.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless instructed otherwise, FreeBSD will use the contents of this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;file as the default response to the 'boot:' prompt.
<BR>
<P>_Is_ this something to do with the problem? Is it posible to reproduce the
<BR>
fix with kernel parms with potato? If so what may they be?
<BR>
<P>Thanks :).
