<EM>&gt; &gt; I recently came into possession of an old DEC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha XLT-300.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hey, that's my primary alpha! Don't call it old :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Sorry....&lt;g&gt;  Since I am 60 myself, I tend to think &quot;old&quot;
<BR>
since I consider it a term of honor ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The first added NIC I tried had a Realtek 8139
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chipset.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; These aren't really to be recommended anyway,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from what I hear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the realtek nics aren't that good.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I have had excellent luck with Realtek chipset NICs in the
<BR>
i386 arch.  They always seem to be recognized and setup
<BR>
properly and have worked for me in about 6 different
<BR>
machinces....but this is an ALPHA, and it DOES seem to be a
<BR>
bit pickey about the hardware it is called to work with ;)
<BR>
(Mached true-parity memory chips, specific video cards,
<BR>
etc).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;---snip---&lt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Are both the on-board and the Lynksys recognized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instance of the driver? I.e., loading one module gives you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; two interfaces? That's what should happen if it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a tulip-compatible;
</EM><BR>
<P>I &quot;think&quot; so.  An &quot;lsmod&quot; shows:
<BR>
<P>Module        Size    Used by
<BR>
tulip         45680      2
<BR>
pci-scan       4184      0 [tulip]
<BR>
<P>As noted before, I am using the latest &quot;tulip&quot; modules from
<BR>
Don Becker, which uses the &quot;pci-scan&quot; layer that he has
<BR>
introduced lately.  Is that a problem??  In var/log/messages
<BR>
I can see where BOTH cards are recognized and setup as eth0
<BR>
and eth1.  As an aside, at the start of the bootup there is
<BR>
a line in /var/log/messages...&quot;Inspecting /boot/System.map&quot;
<BR>
followed by another line &quot;cannot find System.map&quot;. What is
<BR>
the proper label for the /boot/System.map file?  That is
<BR>
what I have it called there.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Did you confirm that ping works fine with the on-board?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  Let me &quot;clarify&quot; a bit.  My LAN is setup to use the
<BR>
192.168.10.xxx address space. I when I have the &quot;on-board&quot;
<BR>
set to the proper LAN address (192.168.10.3) and the other
<BR>
card set to a &quot;dummy&quot; address (10.0.0.1) everything works
<BR>
fine with the on-board...ping, telnet, ftp, etc.  The only
<BR>
thing that doesn't work is the machine will NOT show up on a
<BR>
remote computer's XDMCP &quot;chooser&quot; list.  I &quot;think&quot; this is
<BR>
because the on-board is slower than the rest of the
<BR>
network...not sure about this.  I can ping the on-board, but
<BR>
NOT the second NIC. Pings going out from the ALPHA also work
<BR>
fine without any complaints.  I cannot &quot;ping&quot; the second
<BR>
card.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, when I set the faster Lynksys up for the
<BR>
proper LAN address and the on-board to the &quot;dummy&quot; address,
<BR>
I cannot ping EITHER address from a remote machine.
<BR>
Interestingly, the computer DOES show up on the remote XDMCP
<BR>
&quot;chooser&quot; screen but will not load.  This is the situation
<BR>
where I get the CRC errors when I try to ping from the
<BR>
ALPHA.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Otherwise, I believe the 3Com cards should work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fine on alpha...

</EM><BR>
<P><P>Late-breaking news...AFTER I wrote the above notes.  Based
<BR>
on comments from you and the others on the group, I took a
<BR>
chance and &quot;upgraded&quot; to the &quot;Testing&quot; version of the
<BR>
netbase package.  Now all NICs work as they should!!  I
<BR>
still see the ping CRC errors, but on byte 8 now, just like
<BR>
Wieger mentioned.  It appears I had a couple of things going
<BR>
on and the &quot;upgrade&quot; fixed one of them.  I will get the
<BR>
newer version for the netkit-ping as soon as it becomes
<BR>
avaliable, but I can live with this [BIG GRIN}!
<BR>
<P>Thanks to all!!!
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
