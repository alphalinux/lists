<P>
I could use some help and/or pointers with a problem I have,
<BR>
and cannot solve.
<BR>
<P>I recently came into possession of an old DEC Alpha XLT-300.
<BR>
I brushed the dust off and fired it up and it worked fine.
<BR>
I then loaded the most recent version of Debian (2.2r2) for
<BR>
the Alpha on it and proceeded to experiment.  Everything
<BR>
worked fine and as advertised, but the built-in 10 Mbs
<BR>
ethernet NIC did not match the rest of my home network, and
<BR>
I decided to add a second NIC.  That is where the problem
<BR>
started.  I cannot get the second 100 Mbs NIC to work.
<BR>
<P>The first added NIC I tried had a Realtek 8139 chipset.  The
<BR>
computer would recognize it and it would work for about 10
<BR>
seconds before it would cause a kernel panic and a hard
<BR>
freeze requiring a push of the reset button to reconver.
<BR>
Right after the hard freeze-up the console window would be
<BR>
filled with error messages about kernel panic and an
<BR>
inability to synch with the interrupt handler.  I have tried
<BR>
re-compiling the kernel and modules to remove any extraneous
<BR>
modules and specify that I was using the &quot;Alcor&quot; sub-type of
<BR>
the Alpha, and tried the various options in the PCI section
<BR>
of the kernel config.  Nothing seems to work....the results
<BR>
were the same.  I have tried the latest drivers for this
<BR>
card from Donald Becker's site without results too.
<BR>
<P>The second additional NIC I tried was a Lynksys LNE100TX
<BR>
that purports to have a DEC &quot;tulip&quot; chipset, or derivitive.
<BR>
I had a bit more success here in that it works and sets up
<BR>
OK, BUT a &quot;ping&quot; from the Alpha machine brings up an error
<BR>
message indicating a bad CRC checksum and consistantly
<BR>
identifies byte 42 as being the &quot;mangled&quot; one.  Needless to
<BR>
say I get a 100% packet loss.  Strangely, if I ping the
<BR>
Alpha from another machine, it appears to respond correctly.
<BR>
Again I have tried various kernel configs and am currently
<BR>
using the latest &quot;tulip&quot; modules from Donald Becker's site.
<BR>
I do NOT get the hard freeze when using this NIC.
<BR>
<P>During all of the above machinations, the &quot;built-in&quot; DEC
<BR>
Tulip-based 10 Mbs NIC continued to work flawlessly.
<BR>
<P>My first thought was that this was something wrong in the
<BR>
&quot;tulip&quot; NIC module, but considering the fact that the
<BR>
&quot;built-in&quot; NIC works fine using the same module, I suspect
<BR>
it is something else.  Considering the regularity of the
<BR>
location of the bad byte in the &quot;ping&quot; response, and the
<BR>
message I earlier got from the Realtek chip, I now suspect
<BR>
something is wrong elsewhere....perhaps in the interrupt
<BR>
handling routines??
<BR>
<P>At this point, I am at a loss as how to proceed.  I am
<BR>
definately NOT a programmer or coder.  I am just your basic
<BR>
&quot;dabbler&quot; trying to make something work that I think should
<BR>
work.  I would appreciate any pointers as to how to proceed
<BR>
and/or where to look.
<BR>
<P>The Alpha is NOT &quot;mission-critical&quot; to my home network.
<BR>
<P>Cheers, &amp; Thanks in advance for your time &amp; consideration.
<BR>
