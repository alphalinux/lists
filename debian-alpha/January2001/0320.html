<EM>&gt; Hi,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't know who made them, I'm borrowing them for a while from a Network
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Appliance box, so they all report themselves at NetAPP disks, though I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; guessing NetAPP didn't really make them (as another note I have the array
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; setup with ext3, and so far things are going well).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this sounds interesting. Want to share some experiences regarding Ext-3 on Alphas ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Specifically, do you:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - use journalling
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, the only problem is that the docs state the max journal size is
<BR>
100MB and I don't know if that's really enough for 400Gig, there's no good
<BR>
reference yet!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - use it on a SMP box
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, this is on a dual CS20 833MHz.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And further, did  you try to test the journalling ( like turning off the machine in the middle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of some disk-ops and restart it to see what happens ) ? Do you use large files ( &gt;2Gbytes ) ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is your Ext-3 under heavy load ?
</EM><BR>
<P>It's a news server, not a full feed though. We're using about 100 of the
<BR>
400Gig so far. I have not pulled the plug with it feeding yet. Though I
<BR>
did run some tests on a smaller array before this and didn't come across
<BR>
any problems. Since it's news I'll say we're not getting anywhere near 2GB
<BR>
files.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm planning on using Ext-3 on my UP2000 with kernel 2.4.1, as soon as I receive some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; positive news. I know of ReiserFS, but currently, it's not an option for me.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yikes, that's living on the edge. Are there ext3 patches for 2.4.x
<BR>
yet? I'm running 2.2.19pre7 plus a few other patches. ReiserFS in 2.4.1
<BR>
(+) should be OK on UP alpha (not SMP though).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The disks will be IDE drives with a little IDE to SCSI converter, to make them look like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; normal SCSI drives ( 80 Gig IDE drives are sooo much cheaper ;-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I *really* want some rock-solid journalling FS and I hope, it's going to be Ext-3, since it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looks the most convincing of the current projects to me.
</EM><BR>
<P>this was with 0.0.5e...I think. Not the 0.0.6 that somebody just
<BR>
mentioned.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Excuse: I know, this is not a debian/alpha issue, strictly speaking, but IMHO, this might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be of interest for a lot of debian/alpha users.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sorry, if this mail is of annoyance to anybody on this list - this was not intended.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Regards,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thomas
