Hi,
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Hello,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         For the past two weeks I have been trying to port openafs to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alpha. I've had mostly decent success (through experience -- at IBM I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; porting it to i386-Linux before the source was commonly available). So now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the server processes, the kernel module and afsd compile and run, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; apparently rx packets are corrupted going across the network from client
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to server (or back). Is anyone else wanting to get openafs to alpha-Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who would like to work with me on this? I'm been in a rut now for a few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; days.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes - yes - yes, I'm interested in this work very much :-) !
<BR>
<P>I actually downloaded AFS sources the day they were
<BR>
released, and I'm subscribed to AFS mailing lists since than,
<BR>
but I had to spent some time hunting for decent and cheap
<BR>
HDDs to make any use of it :-)
<BR>
<P>I'm currently running RH because I was in a hurry to get QLogic 2200
<BR>
running and something didn't work out under Debian unstable for me.
<BR>
As soon as I'll solve that problem I can switch back to debian-alpha.
<BR>
<P>There were some talks about Tru64 patches for AFS recently in
<BR>
OpenAFS-devel, I thought that maybe it will be possible to make
<BR>
use of them when they will come out. I'm wondering what is your
<BR>
expert opinion, if there will be some communication between
<BR>
AlphaLinux and Tru64 ports or not ?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Greetings,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Michael.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;I'm not just a server, but I'm also a client.&quot;         Debian GNU/Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Michael Stroucken       stroucki@debian.org      Is your penguin 64 bit?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
<P>Andrei
