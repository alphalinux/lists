<P><EM>&gt;&gt; The library libc-2.2.1.so does not contain the symbol lstat, but does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; define the symbols __lxstat and __lxstat64, as suggested by the header
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; file.  I'm not sure exactly what's going on here, but clearly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; something is wrong. It looks like it might be related to the large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; file (&gt;4GB) support in glibc-2.2.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;xfig may need a recompile.  I'll try to test this tonight to find out.
</EM><BR>
<P>This was with regard to libgtk1.2; that's what you meant to say,
<BR>
right?

<P><EM>&gt;&gt; xdm_4.0.2-1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Finally, xdm itself takes about five minutes to start up, again on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 275MHz PC64. This is independent of the xconsole problem mentioned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; above. I know that the problem is not with the X-server, because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; startx brings it up much faster.  Something must be wrong; the xdm log
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; file is no help, because it's just a condensed version of the X-server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; log. There doesn't appear to be any xdm-specific information in it;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; perhaps this is a clue.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That's very odd.  xdm starts right up on my SX and even faster on my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;UP2k at work.  Granted, I haven't tried it out since 4.0.2-1, but it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;worked very well then.  Initial load time may be killing you, though.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Is xdm being started at boot time or is this from the command line
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;after boot?
</EM><BR>
<P>Either way, same result. Using startx, on the other hand, the X-server
<BR>
comes up in less than a minute. The X-server log reveals lots of
<BR>
modules being loaded; this is the initial load time I'd be worried
<BR>
about. It doesn't seem reasonable that xdm should take so much longer
<BR>
than this.
<BR>
<P>Update: I just tried it again, and xdm actually takes 3-1/2 minutes to
<BR>
bring up the X-server, and during this time it's eating 98% of the
<BR>
CPU. Try this:
<BR>
<P># /etc/init.d/xdm start ; top
<BR>
<P>Then you can watch the CPU utilization until the video mode changes;
<BR>
better yet, do it through a telnet session. I bet that your machines
<BR>
are doing the same thing as mine, only faster.
