<EM>&gt; * Mozilla doesn't compile (anything after M17)
</EM><BR>
<P>Really?...well I've been using the RPMs from RedHat (yes, I know it's not
<BR>
the same as having a .deb, but for him to make these packages it
<BR>
must compile) from <A HREF="http://people.redhat.com/blizzard/software/">http://people.redhat.com/blizzard/software/</A>
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; * Support for Matrox Dual Head is so far non-existant
</EM><BR>
<P>Last I knew some of the Dual head code is dependant on a binary only
<BR>
library from Matrox. How much time have you spent talking to Matrox asking
<BR>
if they'll port this to Alpha?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; * Kernel 2.4.1 DOES NOT WORK ON UP1000 using the Debian method - the other method I haven't tried
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From what I've seen 2.4.1 still has some issues on i386, nevermind a
</EM><BR>
non-x86 arch. These things take time as it's a function of developer
<BR>
resources. How much have you contributed towards the development of
<BR>
2.4? Also, what's the big rush for 2.4, which of it's features must you
<BR>
have that 2.2 can't provide? I somehow doubt that 2.4 runs perfectly on
<BR>
PPC,Sparc etc....as well. I can't speak to the debian packages as I'm
<BR>
running 2.2 on my debian alpha box.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; * Do I need to keep going.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well if they are specific bugs in Debian then I'd say file them in the
<BR>
Debian bug system.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This is not a whine from someone not prepared to help. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is a reflection on the situation we Alpha users, specifically Debian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha users have to deal with. No support apart from each other and no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interest from anybody else.
</EM><BR>
<P>Who are you expecting to be interested? &quot;No support apart from each
<BR>
other&quot;?? I thought that's what community support was all about. Are you
<BR>
saying that you want a phone number to call, someone you can give your
<BR>
credit card number to? I'm not trying to be difficult here, but I'm rather
<BR>
confused by your comments.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Who here agrees?
</EM><BR>
<P>Not I, I've found the Debian (and Linux) communities to be quite good at
<BR>
support.
