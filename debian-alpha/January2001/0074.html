You mean we have to make binNMUs of glibc? Or will you make a new upload

which explicitly requests kernel-headers 2.4.0?

Right now I only see this in the pools: kernel-image-2.4.0-test11-i386
<BR>
There isn't an official 2.4.0 source yet in the archive?
<BR>
Besides, we could probably build kernel-images for 2.4 on m68k, but they do
<BR>
not work so well yet (at least on my box the IDE driver is not yet working,
<BR>
rendering the kernel useless for me). Do you want those in the archive? But
<BR>
who cares, I even uploaded xfree4.0 now to make the archive happy...

<EM>&gt; with ppc, i386 and sparc. Any other ports that want me to keep them in sync,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feel free to donate h/w.
</EM><BR>
How about using debian funds to pay that hardware? I only have one m68k
<BR>
machine, I am not sure if I want to donate that one to you, I could not work
<BR>
for m68k anymore then. 
<BR>
Or maybe get it donated by somebody else, and not necessarily by a
<BR>
developer, after all I am &quot;donating&quot; quite a lot already. IMHO.
