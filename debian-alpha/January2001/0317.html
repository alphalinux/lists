Hi,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't know who made them, I'm borrowing them for a while from a Network
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Appliance box, so they all report themselves at NetAPP disks, though I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guessing NetAPP didn't really make them (as another note I have the array
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; setup with ext3, and so far things are going well).
</EM><BR>
<P>this sounds interesting. Want to share some experiences regarding Ext-3 on Alphas ?
<BR>
Specifically, do you:
<BR>
- use journalling
<BR>
- use it on a SMP box
<BR>
<P>And further, did  you try to test the journalling ( like turning off the machine in the middle
<BR>
of some disk-ops and restart it to see what happens ) ? Do you use large files ( &gt;2Gbytes ) ?
<BR>
Is your Ext-3 under heavy load ?
<BR>
<P>I'm planning on using Ext-3 on my UP2000 with kernel 2.4.1, as soon as I receive some
<BR>
positive news. I know of ReiserFS, but currently, it's not an option for me.
<BR>
The disks will be IDE drives with a little IDE to SCSI converter, to make them look like
<BR>
normal SCSI drives ( 80 Gig IDE drives are sooo much cheaper ;-)
<BR>
<P>I *really* want some rock-solid journalling FS and I hope, it's going to be Ext-3, since it
<BR>
looks the most convincing of the current projects to me.
<BR>
<P>Excuse: I know, this is not a debian/alpha issue, strictly speaking, but IMHO, this might
<BR>
be of interest for a lot of debian/alpha users.
<BR>
Sorry, if this mail is of annoyance to anybody on this list - this was not intended.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
Thomas
