<P>
I've been using ext3 on my Alpha (AS 1000A) recently so I thought I'd share =)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; this sounds interesting. Want to share some experiences regarding Ext-3
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on Alphas ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Specifically, do you:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - use journalling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - use it on a SMP box
</EM><BR>
<P>The box isn't SMP and I am using the journalling.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And further, did  you try to test the journalling ( like turning off the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machine in the middle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of some disk-ops and restart it to see what happens ) ? Do you use large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; files ( &gt;2Gbytes ) ?
</EM><BR>
<P>I did some testing by hitting reset at random times while the disk was active 
<BR>
and while it wasn't, I had mostly good sucess but I do think a file or two got 
<BR>
corrupted.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is your Ext-3 under heavy load ?
</EM><BR>
<P>I ran bonnie++ on it for a while, otherwise the box isn't really production so 
<BR>
the normal load will be low.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm planning on using Ext-3 on my UP2000 with kernel 2.4.1, as soon as I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; receive some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; positive news. I know of ReiserFS, but currently, it's not an option for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wasn't aware of any 2.4.x patches for ext3 yet, I tried to get ReiserFS 
<BR>
working but didn't have much luck, mainly because the 2.2 patches for Alpha 
<BR>
were bad and the current gcc for Alpha chokes on the 2.4 DAC960 driver.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The disks will be IDE drives with a little IDE to SCSI converter, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make them look like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; normal SCSI drives ( 80 Gig IDE drives are sooo much cheaper ;-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Offtopic, but I'm curious where you got those, I wasn't aware of such a thing =)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I *really* want some rock-solid journalling FS and I hope, it's going to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be Ext-3, since it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looks the most convincing of the current projects to me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I actually did get the kernel to oops with 0.0.5e ext3 last night, the 0.0.6a 
<BR>
patch was released recently so I have that running today, if it oopses for me 
<BR>
too I'll mention it.
<BR>
<P>Jim
