<P>
Donald,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I can't explain what is going on, but perhaps I can offer an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;alternative.  I have done about 4-5 installs of Debian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;potato&quot; for the Alpha using ftp.  I have a quite nice Cable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Modem connection, and everything goes quite smoothly.  If I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;recall correctly, just before you get to this point you have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a question about how you want to install the &quot;base system&quot;,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which includes the drivers.  One of the options is to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;install this via ftp, and that is what I used.  If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;choose this option, then it will immediately jump to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;configuring your network and selects the closest mirror then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;starts the d/l.  This only works, I assume, if your ethernet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;card is already detected as mine was.  Using this method, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;did NOT have to d/l and use the &quot;driver&quot; disks and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;appropriate file(s) was selected for me.  It looks like this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would be a viable alternative, even over a slow link for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;installing the &quot;base&quot; system plus driver modules.  After
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this is done, you will re-boot and continue the installation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and you again have a selection point on the method to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;install the rest of the packages.  Just a thought....the ftp
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;method is really nice if you have a good link.  Much faster
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than d/l and burning an iso file on a CDROM!
</EM><BR>
<P>I know of this method, and it will probably be the one I
<BR>
end up using if I can't fix the driver disk.
<BR>
<P>I have tried this in the past, but with less than perfect
<BR>
results. I keep loosing the ftp connection. I've also
<BR>
tried it by transfering over http, but with the same result.
<BR>
<P>I think these problems are related to my router... 
<BR>
Maybe I'll have another go at it if the disks don't
<BR>
work out.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for the hint.
