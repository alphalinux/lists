<P><EM>&gt; some bugs I've encountered while upgrading to glibc-2.2.1 and

<EM>&gt; xfree86-4.0.2:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; xfig_3.2.3.c-4
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This binary is dynamically linked to a library called 'libXaw3d.so.7',
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which as far as I can tell exists nowhere; it's not in the xaw3dg
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; package from stable, testing, or unstable. I don't know how this could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happen; however, after making a symlink from libXaw3d.so.7 to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; libXaw3d.so.6 and running ldconfig, it appears to work OK.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll check this out.  It should be linked against libXaw.so.7 instead.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The library libc-2.2.1.so does not contain the symbol lstat, but does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; define the symbols __lxstat and __lxstat64, as suggested by the header
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; file.  I'm not sure exactly what's going on here, but clearly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something is wrong. It looks like it might be related to the large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; file (&gt;4GB) support in glibc-2.2.
</EM><BR>
<P>xfig may need a recompile.  I'll try to test this tonight to find out.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; xconsole (from xbase-clients_4.0.2-1)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I found that this program was consuming 80% of the CPU time on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 275MHz PC64. This can't be right. xdm_4.0.2-1 runs this program by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; default; I had to disable it (/etc/X11/xdm/Xsetup).
</EM><BR>
<P>Ugh.  This may be harder to debug mostly because of the prohibitive
<BR>
size of Xfree86 to compile.  I'll play with this on the UP2k at work
<BR>
one day to see what I can find.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; xdm_4.0.2-1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Finally, xdm itself takes about five minutes to start up, again on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 275MHz PC64. This is independent of the xconsole problem mentioned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; above. I know that the problem is not with the X-server, because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; startx brings it up much faster.  Something must be wrong; the xdm log
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; file is no help, because it's just a condensed version of the X-server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; log. There doesn't appear to be any xdm-specific information in it;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perhaps this is a clue.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's very odd.  xdm starts right up on my SX and even faster on my
<BR>
UP2k at work.  Granted, I haven't tried it out since 4.0.2-1, but it
<BR>
worked very well then.  Initial load time may be killing you, though.
<BR>
Is xdm being started at boot time or is this from the command line
<BR>
after boot?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I hope this information is helpful to somebody.
</EM><BR>
<P>Me too :-)
