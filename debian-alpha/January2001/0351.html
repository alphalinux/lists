<P>
some bugs I've encountered while upgrading to glibc-2.2.1 and
<BR>
xfree86-4.0.2:
<BR>
<P><P>xfig_3.2.3.c-4
<BR>
<P>This binary is dynamically linked to a library called 'libXaw3d.so.7',
<BR>
which as far as I can tell exists nowhere; it's not in the xaw3dg
<BR>
package from stable, testing, or unstable. I don't know how this could
<BR>
happen; however, after making a symlink from libXaw3d.so.7 to
<BR>
libXaw3d.so.6 and running ldconfig, it appears to work OK.
<BR>
<P><P>libgtk1.2_1.2.8-3.0.1
<BR>
<P>This library is unusable because:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;error while loading shared libraries:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/lib/libgtk-1.2.so.0: undefined symbol: lstat
<BR>
<P>Here's a relevant quote from /usr/include/sys/stat.h
<BR>
(packaged in libc6.1-dev_2.2.1-1):
<BR>
<P>/* To allow the `struct stat' structure and the file type `mode_t'
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bits to vary without changing shared library major version number,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the `stat' family of functions and `mknod' are in fact inline
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrappers around calls to `xstat', `fxstat', `lxstat', and `xmknod',
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which all take a leading version-number argument designating the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data structure and bits used.  &lt;bits/stat.h&gt; defines _STAT_VER with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the version number corresponding to `struct stat' as defined in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that file; and _MKNOD_VER with the version number corresponding to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the S_IF* macros defined therein.  It is arranged that when not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inlined these function are always statically linked; that way a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dynamically-linked executable always encodes the version number
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corresponding to the data structures it uses, so the `x' functions
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the shared library can adapt without needing to recompile all
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;callers.  */
<BR>
<P>Further inspection of this header file reveals that lstat() is an
<BR>
external reference only under the following conditions:
<BR>
<P>#if defined __USE_BSD || defined __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED
<BR>
# ifndef __USE_FILE_OFFSET64
<BR>
/* Get file attributes about FILE and put them in BUF.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If FILE is a symbolic link, do not follow it.  */
<BR>
extern int lstat (__const char *__restrict __file,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;struct stat *__restrict __buf) __THROW;
<BR>
# else
<BR>
...
<BR>
# endif
<BR>
...
<BR>
#endif
<BR>
<P>The library libc-2.2.1.so does not contain the symbol lstat, but does
<BR>
define the symbols __lxstat and __lxstat64, as suggested by the header
<BR>
file.  I'm not sure exactly what's going on here, but clearly
<BR>
something is wrong. It looks like it might be related to the large
<BR>
file (&gt;4GB) support in glibc-2.2.
<BR>
<P><P>xconsole (from xbase-clients_4.0.2-1)
<BR>
<P>I found that this program was consuming 80% of the CPU time on a
<BR>
275MHz PC64. This can't be right. xdm_4.0.2-1 runs this program by
<BR>
default; I had to disable it (/etc/X11/xdm/Xsetup).
<BR>
<P><P>xdm_4.0.2-1
<BR>
<P>Finally, xdm itself takes about five minutes to start up, again on a
<BR>
275MHz PC64. This is independent of the xconsole problem mentioned
<BR>
above. I know that the problem is not with the X-server, because
<BR>
startx brings it up much faster.  Something must be wrong; the xdm log
<BR>
file is no help, because it's just a condensed version of the X-server
<BR>
log. There doesn't appear to be any xdm-specific information in it;
<BR>
perhaps this is a clue.
<BR>
<P><P>I hope this information is helpful to somebody.
