<P>
Well, the big deal is that to enable LFS on glibc, it must be compiled
<BR>
against 2.4.0 headers. This does not break when running on 2.2.x
<BR>
kernels. However, I have found that on sparc atleast, somethings that
<BR>
were compiled against non-LFS glibc-2.2 do not work with LFS enabled
<BR>
glibc-2.2 until recompiled (this does not affect glibc 2.1.3 bins from
<BR>
potato running under LFS glibc-2.2). Among them appear to be ssh and
<BR>
ifupdown.
<BR>
<P>The problem appears to stem from fxstat in libc-nonshared.a. Since I
<BR>
cannot retroactively go back and fix this incompatibility, I am hoping
<BR>
that all archs can start using 2.4.0 headers to compile the latest glibc
<BR>
2.2.1, to avoid this becoming a long term mess.
<BR>
<P>So far, sparc and i386 have been using 2.4.0 headers since about glibc
<BR>
2.2-6. I am going to start doing powerpc myself soon (the only other
<BR>
arch I build myself). I would like all other archs to follow suit
<BR>
(whoever builds glibc for that particular arch), even if it means using
<BR>
local 2.4.0 source (and not something in the archive) so long as you
<BR>
plan to fill this gap once a 2.4.0/2.4.1 source is available in sid.
<BR>
<P>Also, if any ports currently have issues compiling the latest glibc,
<BR>
contact me directly and immediately. I am more than willing to spend the
<BR>
time working things out. I just spent some crunch time with Bdale for
<BR>
ia64 (whom I also work with for hppa). So you new ports (mips? sh?) let
<BR>
me know now if there are any issues (and you old timer ports too :).
<BR>
<P>If you have any questions/concerns/comments, email me privately.
<BR>
<P>PS: Mips maintainers, as soon as you have a base.tgz I can install, I'll
<BR>
get this Indy going and start doing glibc builds myself to upload along
<BR>
with ppc, i386 and sparc. Any other ports that want me to keep them in sync,
<BR>
feel free to donate h/w.
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
