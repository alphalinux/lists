Quoting Jay Estabrook &lt;Jay.Estabrook@compaq.com&gt;:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I believe this can be done, but have never done it myself.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have used the FB code in the kernel on various controllers, TGA and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Matrox at least, but not S3/ViRGE (I've no card). There were some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problems I had to track down in those drivers' code, so it's quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible the same would be true of any others.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't believe I saw a FB driver for S3, I'll have to look some more this 
<BR>
weekend.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Secondly, recently ARC has stopped loading for me, which isn't a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; real problem since I boot from SRM, but I can't run the ECU or RCU
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; from SRM or atleast I don't know how. If I type 'arc' from SRM it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; says it's loading ARC from firmware then hangs before it does the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; driver initialization. I do have he latest SRM and ARC available.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And you need ECU/RCU for what, configuring the DAC? That would be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem; otherwise you'd only need ECU if you were mucking about with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; EISA cards, IIRC.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Originally I wanted to configure the DAC, but I ended up doing it from a x86 
<BR>
box and the DOS utils from Mylex to get it up and running.
<BR>
<P>Also when it POSTs (correct term for SRM? =)) it complains about finding the 
<BR>
DE500 in a slot where it expected nothing, it works but I just wanted to clear 
<BR>
up the EISA config space if possible.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Did ARC stop working when you added the ViRGE, or any other non-standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hardware (hoping it's that simple :-)?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, ARC worked fine for a while with all the cards in it, I was mucking around 
<BR>
with different versions of SRM/ARC to see if I could get SRM to see the Mylex 
<BR>
with the newest SRM (it seems to only work with the revision before last) but 
<BR>
ended up just putting the latest one back and booting from the onboard QLogic.
