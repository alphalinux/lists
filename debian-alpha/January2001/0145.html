<P>Could you set your mailer to wrap lines at 70 chars or so?

<P><EM>&gt; I presently have a 164UX/BX4 system (i.e. ruffian), which presently
</EM><BR>
has NT on a 2G FAT partition, that (dare I say it) I wish to keep, and
<BR>
then a RH6.0 installation scattered over another half dozen or so
<BR>
partitions (the contents of which I have no intention of preserving
<BR>
even a single byte of). I boot into Linux via MILO (of the same age as
<BR>
RH6.0). Don't ask me whether I have ARC or AlphaBios, as I can't
<BR>
remember how long ago it was I last saw the boot screen.
<BR>
<P>Ruffian's ONLY have ARCS BIOS (note the &quot;S&quot; on ARCS).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Milo resides on my FAT partition, doesn't it?
</EM><BR>
<P>MILO needs to be on a FAT partition, yes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I simply need to point the Bios console to the new location?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I plan to install with the .tgz base system files on what was and
</EM><BR>
will eventually be my /home partition, but I fully appreciate that the
<BR>
install process must not touch (write to) that partition during the
<BR>
install process (I'll very temporarily have /home on the / partition,
<BR>
I am happy adding fstab lines on my own afterwards).  
<BR>
<P>I would just run the install as usual (skip doing anything with the
<BR>
future /home partition until you are ready to use it).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; With all this ARC/AlphaBios/whatever plus Milo nonsense, where do I
</EM><BR>
boot from, and how? I know it's either section 6.8 or 6.9 in the
<BR>
documentation, but is it both? Do I do 6.8 and then 6.9?
<BR>
<P>ARCS BIOS loads ldmilo.exe. ldmilo.exe loads MILO. MILO loads the
<BR>
kernel.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In 6.9 it says I don't have to use a floppy, but surely I can't
</EM><BR>
&quot;boot&quot; off my old /home partition can I?. How do I then tell Milo that
<BR>
all the info it used to know about my RH system is bogus? (As I said,
<BR>
I've not touched Milo for donkey's years, and haven't got a clue how I
<BR>
set it up.) 
<BR>
<P>Unless you have your old MILO setup to autoboot, it should just drop
<BR>
you to a prompt. MILO doesn't care what distro you run, you can use
<BR>
just about any MILO (as long as it's supported on your system).
<BR>
<P>Keep the MILO floppy handy just in case something goes wrong :)
<BR>
<P>If you are no longer using your RH6 partition(s), I would suggest
<BR>
installing there (unless there is a reason to do otherwise) and erase
<BR>
RH6. Just make sure you know which partiton your NT install is on and
<BR>
that you don't accidently erase it! :)
