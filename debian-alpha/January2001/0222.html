<P><EM>&gt; So you are recommending either to use only -mcpu= or to use both with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; -mcpu= first?
</EM><BR>
<P>Just use -mcpu.  It should do the right thing in all cases.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What are the &quot;symptoms&quot; that a special code needs -mieee? Most packages
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which I compile, are used for molecular phylogeny. MrBayes, as the name
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; says, works with Bayesian methods. I guess, that fpu-operations are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heavily used in these kind of calculations. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, it sounds like the stuff that you want to compile is definitely in
<BR>
the &quot;needs -mieee&quot; category :-)
<BR>
<P>Honestly, if the packages are meant only for local installation (and not
<BR>
upload to Debian or something similar), I would recommend compiling them
<BR>
with Compaq's compilers since they schedule code for EV5 and EV6 much
<BR>
better than gcc probably ever will.  The compilers are not free to
<BR>
redistribute (hence their exclusion from Debian), but they can be obtained
<BR>
from Compaq's ftp site and only require minor tweaking to work on Debian
<BR>
installations.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Unfortunately, computing time is an important item in molecular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; phylogeny. It is a difference whether an analysis takes 12 days or 7.
</EM><BR>
<P>Definitely use Compaq's compilers...you won't regret it :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Or smaller soft which does a lot of repetitions?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Phylogenetic methods have usually repetitive structure. Datasets are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; calculated through again and again.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, Compaq's compilers do VERY GOOD scheduling of loops in particular
<BR>
(all loads, then operations, then stores in most cases...very efficient
<BR>
stuff).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Apart from this:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I encounter problems to report the -O-bug to submit@bugs.debian.org and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have no idea what is going wrong. The return of my first attempt was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understandable, I put a blank line before the Package line, but after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; correction, it still returned with error message:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Your message didn't have a Package: line at the start (in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pseudo-header following the real mail header), or didn't have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pseudo-header at all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; These were my starting lines:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Package: gcc
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Version: 1:2.95.2-13
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So what is wrong about it? (Preprocessed file was attached to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; e-mail.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Omit the epoch (1:).  I don't know why, but I think the bug system chokes
<BR>
on that.  Either that, or if you used a tab instead of a space between the
<BR>
'Package:' and 'gcc', change it to a space.  Here's a good start:
<BR>
<P>Package: gcc
<BR>
Version: 2.95.2-13
<BR>
<P>C
