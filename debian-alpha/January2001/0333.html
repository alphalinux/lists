<P>
Most of the packages in Debian-2.2 seem to reflect source code that
<BR>
was current about a year ago. Many newer packages require glibc-2.2
<BR>
and xfree86-4.0 (or at least its client libraries). My apologies if
<BR>
the answers to these questions can be found in some place that should
<BR>
have been obvious to me, but wasn't.
<BR>
<P>Firstly, it appears to me that many packages in the pool/ directories
<BR>
are not referenced in the dists/{stable,testing}/ archives, and
<BR>
dists/unstable/main/binary-alpha is completely unpopulated. What is
<BR>
the significance of this fact? I thought that
<BR>
dists/{{un,}stable,testing}/ was supposed to become a bunch of
<BR>
symlinks referencing the actual pool/ archive.
<BR>
<P>With regard to glibc, I seem to recall that glibc-2.1 was
<BR>
binary-incompatible with glibc-2.0, at least on alpha, and that you
<BR>
had to upgrade the whole system at once or risk major breakage; I
<BR>
never understood exactly what the issue was. Is this also the case
<BR>
with installing glibc-2.2, or is this a more transparent upgrade?  If
<BR>
so, do its associated libraries (for hostname resolution or whatever)
<BR>
need to be upgraded at the same time?
<BR>
<P>Finally, is it safe to upgrade the client-side part of xfree86 to
<BR>
4.0.x, while leaving the server at version 3.3.6? What are the
<BR>
packages involved, and is there any particular procedure that needs to
<BR>
be followed because of the major restructuring of xfree86 between
<BR>
these releases?
<BR>
<P>I want to upgrade packages like spruce and xfig, because the versions
<BR>
in Debian-2.2 appear to be buggy, and the newer packages all seem to
<BR>
have dependencies on more recent dynamic libraries. (Is this for real,
<BR>
or just an artifact of the build process?) Thanks for any information
<BR>
on these issues.
<BR>
