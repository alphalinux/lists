<EM>&gt; Could you set your mailer to wrap lines at 70 chars or so?

<P>Firstly, I can't (don't know how to with this lousy web-mail interface) and secondly, I believe that adding line breaks at a particular pitch counts as claiming that I know the width of every reader's mail windows. Which I don't. Let the reader wrap lines wherever he/she/it desires.

<P><EM>&gt; Ruffian's ONLY have ARCS BIOS (note the &quot;S&quot; on ARCS).

<EM>&gt; &gt; Milo resides on my FAT partition, doesn't it?

<EM>&gt; MILO needs to be on a FAT partition, yes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I simply need to point the Bios console to the new location?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, the install has &quot;worked&quot;, but left me with some &quot;issues&quot;.
<BR>
Booting into linux is trivial from the Milo console, but my &quot;go to Milo Console&quot; option in ARCS no longer works. It's not a big problem presently but don't like things that used to work suddenly not working. My old &quot;RedHat&quot; option loads Milo correctly, but drops me to the console when it can't find the RedHat kernel. I'll tweak that to point to the new Debian kernel, but then I lose my route to the Milo console! The paths in the two ARCS options point to the same Milo, so why can one find it and one can't.
<BR>
<P>Oh, in the end I decided to install from the Network, as the onbaord network card was supported by the installation. The whole process took just 2 floppies, and 5 minutes on a 200KB/s connection to tampere.tut.fi - marvelous!
<BR>
<P>However, and I ranted a fair bit on the RedHat list about this in the past, the onboard network adapter (21143) still doesn't support 100Mb/s operation. I have a spare RTL8139 10/100 card. 
<BR>
Which adapter am I more likely to be able top get to run at 100Mb/s? I didn't notice any RTL8139 module, but have heard rumours about there being one.
