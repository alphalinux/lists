<P><EM>&gt; Thanks for the tip from Jean-Paul, I finally managed to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rid of perl5.6 errors - &quot;apt-get -f install perl-5.6-*&quot; did it for me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [Thinking about it, perhaps I need to subscribe to some other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Debian lists, not only alpha, to stay tuned with such kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; questions.]
</EM><BR>
<P>The best list to be on for that is debian-devel.  There's a lot of 
<BR>
noise on that list, but it can be VERY informative.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I: Unpacking glibc-2.2.1.tar.bz2 as glibc-2.2.1 in temp-unpack/.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prep.sh: bzcat: command not found
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok, here's what I do for all builds:
<BR>
&nbsp;apt-get source &lt;package&gt;
<BR>
rather than using the '-b' option.  This unpacks the sources, but does not
<BR>
build.  Then, I go into the unpacked dir and look at debian/control (or in
<BR>
this case, debian/control.in, since the control file is generated at build
<BR>
time).  In there, you'll see a line that begins with:
<BR>
&nbsp;Build-Depends:
<BR>
Which will list everything you need to build the package (or should...in
<BR>
the case of glibc, it will...I can vouch for that personally).
<BR>
<P>A large number of packages use the Build-Depends lines now to help the
<BR>
autobuilders know what to install in order to build the packages.  These
<BR>
lines also help me, since I'm the normal &quot;semi-autobuilder&quot; for Alpha :-P
<BR>
<P>In short, though...here's the list of things you'll need:
<BR>
<P>Build-Depends: gettext, gcc (&gt;= 2.95.2-15), make (&gt;= 3.78-4),
<BR>
dpkg-dev (&gt;= 1.4.1.5), debianutils (&gt;= 1.13.1), tar (&gt;= 1.13.11), bzip2,
<BR>
texinfo (&gt;= 4.0), kernel-headers [!hurd-i386], mig [hurd-i386],
<BR>
hurd-dev [hurd-i386], gnumach-dev [hurd-i386]
<BR>
Build-Depends-Indep: perl5
<BR>
<P>Oh, one other thing, if you see something like:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kernel-headers [!hurd-i386]
<BR>
It basically means that whatever platform(s) is/are in the brackets either
<BR>
need or don't need the listed package.  Since the above example has &quot;!&quot; in
<BR>
front of hurd-i386, it just means that hurd-i386 doesn't need that
<BR>
package.  If there were no &quot;!&quot;, then it would need it only on the listed
<BR>
platform(s):
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mig [hurd-i386]
<BR>
Means only hurd-i386 needs 'mig' installed.
<BR>
<P>You may run into problems building glibc involving the kernel headers.  If
<BR>
you do, please write me directly and I'll tell you what to modify or add
<BR>
to get you through that (FYI, I build all glibc's for Debian-Alpha and
<BR>
have for years now).
