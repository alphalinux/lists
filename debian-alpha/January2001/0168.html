<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Short bit of info I thought the list members might find useful:

<EM>&gt; &gt;This might have been OK on this list if not:

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Northern Linux  - Pre-installed.

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;With debian preinstalled it might be acceptable. Do you or your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;company support debian in any way?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Certainly. If someone wants Deb on a machine we will be glad to install it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Can we support it? That's tougher.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, what I meant with &quot;supporting debian&quot; is the debian project
<BR>
itself.  For example, VA Linux has now supported debian for many years,
<BR>
donating hardware and bandwidth to the project, and in fact employing
<BR>
people to work on debian.  And that was when they basically sold Red Hat
<BR>
preinstalled on their systems (for similar reasons you state in your
<BR>
emails, I presume).
<BR>
<P>Anyway, thanks for your response; at least I know that your message was
<BR>
in good faith and not blatant spam as sometimes is the case. However,
<BR>
spam (even in forms as yours) is _not_ wanted on the debian lists (or in
<BR>
fact anywhere).  Perhaps if you were an active person on the lists,
<BR>
participating in discussions etc, and you slipped in an URL to your
<BR>
company in a subtle manner, it would be different.
<BR>
