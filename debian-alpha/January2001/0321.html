HI,
<BR>
thanks for the info, first of all.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I'm planning on using Ext-3 on my UP2000 with kernel 2.4.1, as soon as I receive some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; positive news. I know of ReiserFS, but currently, it's not an option for me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yikes, that's living on the edge. Are there ext3 patches for 2.4.x
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yet? I'm running 2.2.19pre7 plus a few other patches. ReiserFS in 2.4.1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (+) should be OK on UP alpha (not SMP though).
</EM><BR>
<P>Not that i know of, but i've been told, they are not far away. Besides the fact, that
<BR>
2.4.1 survived the first round of stress-testing just fine, it seems to work OK for
<BR>
me, although i did not yet try lots of new features ( netfilters, devFS and the like ). In addition,
<BR>
my system only has disks and networking, nothing else ( runs of a serial console ),. so
<BR>
take my comments with a grain of salt.
<BR>
OTOH, i really like some of the new features in the kernel.
<BR>
<P>I'll pass a few releases of the first Ext-3/2.4.x combo, before i try. But it's definitely
<BR>
good news, that the journalling logic and the FS core seems to be in good shape.
<BR>
<P><P>Regards,
<BR>
Thomas
