Hi,

<P><EM>&gt; I would use -mcpu= before -Wa,-m21164a in general, but that really depends
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on what you're looking to do.  The -Wa option passes the -m21164a option
</EM><BR>
<P>So you are recommending either to use only -mcpu= or to use both with
<BR>
-mcpu= first?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; One thing I was told to use as well, was -mieee. What are the comments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on this item? Does it slow down the execution of the code?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The -mieee option is a special case, IMO.  If you have code that needs it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (ie, anything that needs IEEE math compliance or anything that will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generate a SIGFPE), use it.  
</EM><BR>
<P>What are the &quot;symptoms&quot; that a special code needs -mieee? Most packages
<BR>
which I compile, are used for molecular phylogeny. MrBayes, as the name
<BR>
says, works with Bayesian methods. I guess, that fpu-operations are
<BR>
heavily used in these kind of calculations. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If not, it does slow down the code and bloats it a bit.  There have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been frequent discussions about compiling the entire Alpha deb tree
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with -mieee, but so far, nobody has made a convincing enough argument
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for it to justify the general slow-down that we would see. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Unfortunately, computing time is an important item in molecular
<BR>
phylogeny. It is a difference whether an analysis takes 12 days or 7.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In reality, though, for small binaries like 'ls', it won't make a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; noticable difference, but larger software would make it very apparent.
</EM><BR>
<P>Or smaller soft which does a lot of repetitions?
<BR>
Phylogenetic methods have usually repetitive structure. Datasets are
<BR>
calculated through again and again.
<BR>
<P><P>Apart from this:
<BR>
<P>I encounter problems to report the -O-bug to submit@bugs.debian.org and
<BR>
have no idea what is going wrong. The return of my first attempt was
<BR>
understandable, I put a blank line before the Package line, but after
<BR>
correction, it still returned with error message:
<BR>
<P>Your message didn't have a Package: line at the start (in the
<BR>
pseudo-header following the real mail header), or didn't have a
<BR>
pseudo-header at all.
<BR>
<P><P>These were my starting lines:
<BR>
<P>Package: gcc
<BR>
Version: 1:2.95.2-13
<BR>
<P>So what is wrong about it? (Preprocessed file was attached to the
<BR>
e-mail.)
