<P><EM>&gt; :-) I would guess all easily corrected problems are corrected by now :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Hehehehe...most of them are... :-P
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Are there any descriptions of the problems available somewhere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the rest of us to have a look ? g++/alpha specifics aren't easy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to find and track down, let alone Debian's ones.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, there aren't really any Debian-specific problems.  The C++/g++
<BR>
problems are an upstream issue.  I'll see if I can find the thread where
<BR>
it was discussed earlier before expounding on it here.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Well, google gives a rather long response to &quot;Debian source package
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; glibc&quot; query, and being rather new to Debian I don't know yet where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to get it, so please kindly send it to me.
</EM><BR>
<P>Will do...attached...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Please do, I've got a few days before jumping back to getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fiber channel stuff working, would be nice to make a step toward
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OpenOffice on Alpha :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>If I can't find the thread today, I'll either put up a page on
<BR>
people.debian.org describing it or will write an email about it (that is,
<BR>
if I can get to people.debian.org...right now, I can't get to auric,
<BR>
so...).
