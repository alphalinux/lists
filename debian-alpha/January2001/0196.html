<P>
I got galeon (<A HREF="http://galeon.sourceforge.net/">http://galeon.sourceforge.net/</A>) working this evening!
<BR>
<P>I'm using Mozilla 0.7 which I compiled from source (I suggest you
<BR>
turn off debug symbols as it uses over a gig of disk space). Mozilla
<BR>
itself doesn't work but raptor (the `viewer') does. I then downloaded
<BR>
the latest galeon (0.9pre3) and compiled, I suggest you read the
<BR>
instructions carefully as there are a few sutleties. I don't know if
<BR>
my mozilla is incorrectly installed but it's not the same as galeon
<BR>
expects so I sym-linked all the directories in the dist/bin directory
<BR>
into the dist directory, I sym-linked dist/bin/component.reg into
<BR>
dist and then created a directory called components in which I sym-
<BR>
linked all files (shared libs) in bin/components to and all files in
<BR>
lib/components. This seems to work. If this does't work for you
<BR>
just use strace to work out what files it is trying to find.
<BR>
<P>Galeon is quite useable, its reasonably responsive and only uses
<BR>
45MBytes of memory :-( There are few funnies; cut and paste doesn't
<BR>
really work very well and when you start it for a second time you
<BR>
must delete bookmarks.xml, history.xml, session.xml. If you use
<BR>
bookmarks then you out of luck for the time being. Having said all
<BR>
that it does keep all of its settings.
<BR>
<P>Some details:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dist:	potato, with a lot of updated gnome libs
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;os:	4.0
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hw:	XL300
<BR>
<P>Could this finally be the time when we get a decent web browers?
<BR>
<P><P>rgh
