<EM>&gt; &gt; Finally, xdm itself takes about five minutes to start up, again on a

<EM>&gt; &gt; 275MHz PC64. This is independent of the xconsole problem mentioned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; above. I know that the problem is not with the X-server, because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; startx brings it up much faster.  Something must be wrong; the xdm log
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; file is no help, because it's just a condensed version of the X-server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; log. There doesn't appear to be any xdm-specific information in it;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; perhaps this is a clue.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's very odd.  xdm starts right up on my SX and even faster on my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; UP2k at work.  Granted, I haven't tried it out since 4.0.2-1, but it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worked very well then.  Initial load time may be killing you, though.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is xdm being started at boot time or is this from the command line
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; after boot?
</EM><BR>
<P>I noticed this too, about a month ago. I usually run my alpha headless,
<BR>
only connecting to it via network. However, at that time I had taken it
<BR>
with me to the debian booth at the Amsterdam Linux Expo, and when
<BR>
starting up xdm I also noticed it took a couple of minutes to start up.
<BR>
I didn't have time to diagnose this there, and since then I've forgotten
<BR>
about it... I actually thought it might be trying to resolve something
<BR>
via DNS (not having any IP connectivity there).
<BR>
<P>I'll see if I can look into this in at the weekend.
