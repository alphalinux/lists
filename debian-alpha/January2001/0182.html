 ('binary' encoding is not supported, stored as-is)
This isn't so much a Debian-alpha question as it is a general alpha
<BR>
question, but if I can get these issues resolved the box will have Debian
<BR>
on it again =)
<BR>
<P>The hardware is an AlphaServer 1000A 4/266 with a onboard QLogic ISP
<BR>
1020, DE500 NIC, Trio64v+ video (onboard video disabled) and Mylex
<BR>
DAC960PL RAID. I have SRM 5.7-83, which I believe was the last one
<BR>
released for this model.
<BR>
<P>Basically the onboard QLogic is the problem, I have a Seagate ST34371N
<BR>
(id 0) and the DEC RRD45 CDROM (id 4) plugged into it and they're both
<BR>
giving me problems. The cdrom problems could be because I'm using CDRs,
<BR>
but IIRC they worked fine before. I'm getting sparse errors, sometimes
<BR>
SRM will see the seagate right away sometimes it takes a minute,
<BR>
sometimes it boots up all the way sometimes it freezes in the middle of
<BR>
loading a kernel via aboot, if it boots all the way it usually oopses
<BR>
after a bit of work.
<BR>
<P>After a cold power on I will sometimes get this in the SRM error log
<BR>
(seen via `cat el` if I'm referring to it incorrectly):
<BR>
I snipped the middle and right column because I believe they're just
<BR>
other representations of the same data, the 00143 appears to always be
<BR>
the same but the rest sometimes changes although they're always in order.
<BR>
<P>I/O failed on pka0.0.0.2000.0 
<BR>
00143b0c
<BR>
00143b1c
<BR>
00143b2c
<BR>
00143b3c
<BR>
00143c0c
<BR>
00143c1c
<BR>
00143c2c
<BR>
00143c3c
<BR>
<P>Other times I'll get something similar to : &quot;mailbox I/O failed for
<BR>
pka0.4.0.2000.0&quot; with a state number after it, 8006 comes to mind but I
<BR>
don't have that error infront of me right now to verify. I don't believe
<BR>
the drive is messed up because I hooked it up to one of my x86 boxes
<BR>
1542's and ran badblocks on ~25% of the device (couldn't mount it because
<BR>
I didn't have support for OSF disklabels in the kernel)  and it had no
<BR>
problems. I don't believe it's the cable because I tried another cable,
<BR>
the one from the 1542 actually, and I got the same erratic symptoms. Is
<BR>
there someway I can verify the QLogic is working ok? if I run disks
<BR>
(which appears to be a script that runs exer on the scsi disk) it
<BR>
eventually fails with a hard error but that doesn't tell me what's messed
<BR>
up.
<BR>
<P>I just got it to oops and it blamed klogd, the code with an * is &quot;stl
<BR>
zero,0(zero)&quot; I can post the whole thing if need be, but it's alot to
<BR>
type =)
<BR>
<P>I'm going to try to snag a spare disk from work tomorrow, because it's
<BR>
possible there is shock damage since I had to physically transport the
<BR>
box recently, and I'll send again if that fixes my problems but I have my
<BR>
doubts
<BR>
<P>Anyway I'm going to get some sleep, thank for any help you can provide.
<BR>
