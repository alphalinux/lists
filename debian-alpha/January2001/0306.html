<EM>&gt; &gt; There are 3 packages that are currently giving me trouble:

<EM>&gt; &gt; w3m, man-db, and vim-gtk.
</EM><BR>
[dselect stuff snipped]
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; w3m depends on libc6.1 (&gt;= 2.1.97)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ah, this is potato!
</EM><BR>
<P>I should have made that more clear, yeah.
<BR>
<P>[vi behavior]
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, I can reproduce this on a potato system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not sure how to cope with this; I guess I could upload to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;stable&quot;, and hope it gets into proposed-updates; however, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recall one of the ftp-masters writing that proposed-updates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should go away...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The point is that potato is &quot;stable&quot;, meaning nothing really gets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changed there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Aargh, man-db got installed as a security-fix a couple of days
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ago. Whoever Somehow the alpha package must have been botched
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (the i386 package is OK).  I'll have a look at fixing this for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; potato.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe there needs to be a policy discussion on what to do with obviously
<BR>
broken security updates?  It seems to me that a system where the admin
<BR>
can't use man may be some sort of security risk all by itself.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; It only generates the zsoelim message once for each man page looked at, though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; installing a man-db package resets that.  My best guess would be that man-db
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It only generates a manpage if there isn't one in the cache.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Apparently even with the error a file (possibly empty) is created.
</EM><BR>
<P>I figured as much.  I mentioned it because it affected the reproducability
<BR>
of the problem.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I suspect that the vim-gtk was built on a system that didn't have gtk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; installed at the time, so the configure step built a non-graphical vim.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Build-Depends should help against that in the future...
</EM><BR>
<P>Cool.  I take it there's basically no chance of getting a fixed (rebuilt)
<BR>
version into stable or proposed-updates, though?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; user unaligned acc      : 39158409 (pc=12004e170,va=1203801d2)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ouch, that's a lot...
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, the system has been up for a while, but yeah.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Anyway, it might be recommendable to upgrade to &quot;testing&quot;,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which is quite usable IMHO. At least there things can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fixed easily.
</EM><BR>
<P>That sort of defeats the purpose of stable, doesn't it?  I'm running Debian
<BR>
stable because I want a system that won't break on me, but still gets timely
<BR>
security fixes.  (And for the most part, Debian stable does this admirably)
<BR>
I recommend Debian to my less computer-adept friends for similar reasons.
<BR>
<P>Maybe we should call testing stable instead, if it's less broken.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, thanks for your help.
