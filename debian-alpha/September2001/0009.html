<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6th Linux Developers Meeting in Oldenburg
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thursday, September 27th to Sunday, 30th
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;University of Oldenburg, Wechloy
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-----------------------------------------
<BR>
<P><P>This is the public invitation for Linux developers to attend this
<BR>
years' Linux Developers Meeting in Oldenburg.  The scope of this
<BR>
meeting is to port Linux to non-intel architectures. It is derived
<BR>
from the linux/m68k meeting 1995 in Solingen , though, recently there
<BR>
were a lot of other architectures as well.
<BR>
<P>Just like the last years, the purpose of this meeting is to get as
<BR>
much of the Linux/m68k core developers and active users together to
<BR>
discuss current problems, show off projects, exchange news, and
<BR>
generally to have fun.
<BR>
<P>Like last year, the meeting will take place from thursday afternoon
<BR>
(September 27th) to sunday evening (September 30th).  You don't have
<BR>
to attend from thursday, it's an offer for those of you who would like
<BR>
to and who can afford coming early.  If you can't make it that early,
<BR>
just join when you can afford it.  The meeting will take place at the
<BR>
same place like last year (that is University of Oldenburg, Wechloy).
<BR>
<P>For those of you, who don't know Oldenburg yet, it's in the northern
<BR>
part of Germany.  That means, you'll find lots of green areas (trees,
<BR>
meadows etc.), good air and less industries.  The meeting will be held
<BR>
at the science building of the University of Oldenburg, in Oldenburg
<BR>
Wechloy.
<BR>
<P>If you would like to attend the meeting, please send back this form,
<BR>
so I can calculate space, power, food and stuff.  Space, power and
<BR>
connectivity will thankfully be sponsored by the University, food and
<BR>
stuff will be sponsored by ffis e.V., except dinner in restaurants.
<BR>
We will be able to use showers inside of the sport building.
<BR>
<P>You'll need to take with you these things: machines, monitors,
<BR>
technical documentation (very important), enough triple plugs for your
<BR>
machines, some network cabling, some hubs/switches, sleeping bag, air
<BR>
mattress, towel, shower stuff, plate, cutlery, coffee mug.
<BR>
<P>Comprehensive Information are on the web:
