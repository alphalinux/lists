<P>OK,
<BR>
<P>I've looked at the firewall logs, the packets from my Alpha get through 
<BR>
the firewall, but the response from the external http server is denied.
<BR>
<P>At typical line from the log file is:
<BR>
24032:Sep 11 15:40:20 firewall kernel: Packet log: input - eth1 PROTO=6 209.116.70.80:80 155.198.83.63:34734 L=60 S=0x00 I=44910 F=0x4000 T=42 (#114)
<BR>
<P>The reason they are denied is because a firewall rule denies any incoming
<BR>
http connections above port number 5999. Here the port number is 34734.
<BR>
<P>Though I don't understand http clearly, presumably this is because it is
<BR>
the port my machine opened to make the http connection in the first place.
<BR>
Anyone have any idea why my Alpha is chosing such a high port number, and 
<BR>
how can I fix it?
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
<P>Edgar.
