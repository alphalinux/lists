Hi!
<BR>
<P>I'm trying to build cds for the alpha arch as well as for all the other
<BR>
target arches for woody to make them available for testing as aj had
<BR>
sugested.
<BR>
<P>However I have came into problems when trying to build for alpha when it
<BR>
comes to make the cds bootable, it seems that the script to make them
<BR>
bootable is no longer valid.
<BR>
<P>I have tricked the debian-cd/tools/boot/woody/boot-alpha script so that it
<BR>
would continue without stopping on the first error and I could see all the
<BR>
errors it is outputing, wich are these:
<BR>
<P>Making the binary CDs bootable ...

<P>If someone could give some advice about this or even better, fix it on
<BR>
debian-cd, it would be great, as I could start building cds for alpha, wich
<BR>
is the only arch not building right now.
<BR>
<P>Of the other 7 arches wich are right now on Woody 6 are already built, and
<BR>
the other, hppa will be built when new Boot Floppies are uploaded, so only
<BR>
Alpha is missing.
<BR>
<P>Thank you very much in advance!
