Hi,
<BR>
<P>I've came across a _real_ strange thing.
<BR>
On my Alpha ( UP2000, potato-TC3, dist-upgraded last friday ), I installed hdparm 3.6-1
<BR>
out of curiosity, in order to test my disk-transfer rates.
<BR>
I have three SCSI disks and i used the following command line, to test my first drive, right
<BR>
after I installed the package:
<BR>
<P>/sbin/hdparm -Tt /dev/sda1
<BR>
/dev/sda1:
<BR>
&nbsp;Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.54 seconds =238.45 MB/sec
<BR>
&nbsp;Timing buffered disk reads:  Illegal instruction
<BR>
<P>After the command gave the illegal instruction, the _executable file_ was corrupted !
<BR>
Thus,  another try with the same command-line produced:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;./hdparm: cannot execute binary file
<BR>
<P>and file /sbin/hdparm gave:
<BR>
<P>./hdparm: data
<BR>
<P>hmm. Ok. I removed hdparm, using dpkg -r hdparm and reinstalled it. Upon the next
<BR>
invocations, it worked three times (on different drives ) and after that, failed again on
<BR>
/dev/sdb1. Same error, leaving the binary-file of hdparm corrupt.
<BR>
<P>Now, Ok, I use kernel 2.4.0-test11, but have not yet seen such a behaviour on
<BR>
any other program. Although, I am almost certain, the faliure is related to the
<BR>
kernel as being a 2.4-test series, I wonder, if anybody else ever observed something
<BR>
similar.
<BR>
IMHO, this is very bizarre, I have never seen any executable in any UNIX evironment
<BR>
being corrupted by merely running it.
<BR>
<P>Any ideas ? Anybody willing to try either hdparm on the stock-2.2 series kernels
<BR>
and under some 2.4-test series ?
<BR>
<P>I'll poke around in hdparm-sources a bit, in order to get an idea what _might_ have
<BR>
happened. But believe me, this one gets me ;)
<BR>
<P>A _very_ confused
<BR>
