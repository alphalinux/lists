<P>
Good day all,
<BR>
<P>I am presently running Debian on my Celeron home computer, but would
<BR>
like to experiment with a 21164 based Alpha workstation.  Any advice
<BR>
from the Debian Alpha community would be much appreciated.
<BR>
<P>Packages:  Having researched Paul Slootman's Alpha/i386 diffs page (
<BR>
<A HREF="http://auric.debian.org/~paul/alpha/diff/">http://auric.debian.org/~paul/alpha/diff/</A> ), it seems that the stable
<BR>
potato release of Alpha had roughly 116 fewer packages than the i396
<BR>
release.  This seems pretty good overall.  Does Debian Alpha usually
<BR>
keep up with the i386 packages this well?  Are there any major packages
<BR>
missing from the Alpha distro?
<BR>
<P>Compiling:  My understanding is that the compiler released by Digital
<BR>
for use with Linux does a much better job of compiling than the standard
<BR>
GCC compiler - resulting in much faster code.  Are the binaries compiled
<BR>
for the Debian Alpha distribution made using the Digital compiler, or GCC?
<BR>
<P>Desktop practicality: Since this would be a home computer, the Debian
<BR>
Alpha system would mostly be used for web browsing, email, word
<BR>
processing, playing CDs, etc.  No game playing though.  While I know
<BR>
that Alphas are superb scientific and engineering workstations, how well
<BR>
do they manage in this sort of home user role?
<BR>
<P>Many thanks,
<BR>
<P><PRE>
