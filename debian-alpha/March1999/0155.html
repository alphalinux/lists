Hi,
<BR>
<P>I installed Slink yesterday on my XL-300. I did this from an CD set
<BR>
burned from the official Debian-CD images. Some things I noticed:
<BR>
<P>* The Install Guide (install/install.html) suggests that booting
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;directly from CD is the easiest thing if it is supported by the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;system -- I believe this is not true. I found the correct descrition
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in    the README of /dists/slink/../98-03-05, which isn't that easy
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to find. 
<BR>
<P>* I would have expected the contents of the above directory also in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;/boot, but there was no root, recsue, etc images.
<BR>
<P>* Booting without floppies doesn't seems possible, though the manual
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;suggests it. I booted linload, MILO and the kernel from CD, but I
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;needed to make a root floppy. I recall that some days ago it was
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mentioned on this list to patch the kernel in a way that would make
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;it possible to load an ordinary file as a ramdisk image. If this is 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;true, it isn't easily accessible as I havn't found this on the CDs. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If it would be possible, /dists/slinkg ... /98-03-05/root1440.img
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;isn't exactly in easy to remember name.
<BR>
<P>* It should be stated more clearly, that the path entries in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;AlphaBIOS boot menu require backslashes. Also, it should be noted
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that only the error message of the OS boot path can be ignored, not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the   one about the loader entry.
<BR>
<P>Well, I don't want to go into the non-Alpha specific issues, but I was
<BR>
suprised to see two emacs versions installed as part of a standard
<BR>
profile (scientific workstation).
<BR>
<P>I went to sleep after the installation, so I cannot comment on other
<BR>
issues right now.
<BR>
<P>Martin
