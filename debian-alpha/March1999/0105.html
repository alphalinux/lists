<P>
Still some more work for the ftpmasters, 
<BR>
<P>1)
<BR>
Could you update: disks-alpha/current  from
<BR>
~lprylli/public_html/axp/bf990305.
<BR>
<P>I have added the current documentation, a md5sum.txt file and
<BR>
be careful the base-[1-8].bin and base2_1.tgz files have CHANGED.
<BR>
<P>All the other existing files are the same, that's why it may be better
<BR>
not to create a complete new directory.
<BR>
<P>2)
<BR>
I send a mail recently about the current nis alpha package which is unstable, I
<BR>
have uploaded into incoming a nis compiled from hamm source, which
<BR>
ended in REJECT because of older version. Is it possible
<BR>
to install it manually? (it is signed now)
<BR>
<P><P>That way the archive will be in sync with the CD that are 
<BR>
currently being generated on cdimage.debian.org. I have tried
<BR>
a CD generated locally and it rocks!!! Debian/Alpha looks in good
<BR>
shape for release (except the doc is dispersed, and except testing
<BR>
has not been done on all subarchs).
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
<P>Loic
<BR>
<P><P>Background to explain motivation for the changes:
<BR>
<P>1)
<BR>
For the change of the base2_1.tgz files:
<BR>
It appeared that the master file that have been used for profiles and
<BR>
tasks on the Alpha root disks was a bit obsolete. In particular X11
<BR>
packages were not selected as appropriate for some profiles, leading
<BR>
to incomplete selection at installation. The user had to resolve
<BR>
the conflict/dependency problems manually after selecting a profile.
<BR>
I have tested two different install with the new base files.
<BR>
<P>2)
<BR>
About the nis package:
<BR>
&nbsp;I know the binary compiled from hamm source is rock solid, I am
<BR>
running it on several productions machines for some months, on an
<BR>
other machine where I have tried to run the current nis, it has never
<BR>
lasted more than a few days before segfaulting. I have try to upload
<BR>
new recompiled package that seems more stable, but finally even the
<BR>
last nis_3.3.1-1axp3.deb is not stable.
