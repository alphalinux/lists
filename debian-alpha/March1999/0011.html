<EM>&gt;Steve&gt; If we have another week, then I'd say pull the images for now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Steve&gt; while we re-think things.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Adam&gt; Why wait?  I'm a little nervous by how little testing the CDs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Adam&gt; have gotten compared to hamm.  I know you guys have done a great
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Adam&gt; job but my sense was that with phil's efforts for slink, the
</EM><BR>
<P>If we leave the images around now, people like CD vendors will end up
<BR>
using them by mistake, and then we end up with inconsistent stuff out
<BR>
there. And there has been a lot of testing, just not so much in the way of
<BR>
testing &quot;official&quot; images as last time.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'm going to set up a US mirror of the images again, so that should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;provide more testers for this final week.
</EM><BR>
<P>Cheers.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Incidentially I can't build the images here -- I get 2 &quot;critical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;errors&quot; that pppconfig and alsa-modules (iirc) depend on whiptail
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which is on disc #2.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, I'm checking into this.
<BR>
<P>[ Not aimed at netgod, but you're here... :-) ]
<BR>
<P>The slink release has been a mess, culminating in a last-minute &quot;sorry, we
<BR>
missed it again&quot; announcement. If we're going to release properly next
<BR>
Tuesday at 00:00 GMT, then we need a schedule like the following:
<BR>
<P>1. Fixes needed for each set allowed in Tue, Wed, Thu and then _no more
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uploads_ for any reason. At all. None.
<BR>
<P>2. Starting _now_ we have people building CD images for each platform.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These will need to be re-done again later as uploads are made, but we
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;need feedback _now_ if there are any missing packages or other CD image
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;problems.
<BR>
<P>3. On Friday final images are made for each of the release architectures.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can do i386 and source, we need volunteers for m68k, alpha and sparc. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us know ASAP if you can help. Steve, you willing to do sparc still?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, one person could do all of them, but in practice this just
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;does not work. And these need to be sanity checked before we pronounce
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them ready to go. 
<BR>
<P>4. The 4 image maintainers(?) mail me Friday/Saturday to report progress,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let me know when we have images ready to go. At that point I get them
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;onto cdimage.debian.org so they can be mirrored worldwide ready for the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end of Monday - this takes a _long_ time for ~7GB of image files.
<BR>
<P>5. At 00:00 GMT on Tuesday the 9th March we announce release to the world;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;images are already on mirrors ready to be downloaded and those of us
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selling CDs will have copies ready to go in the mail.
<BR>
<P>Comments? We _can_ do this, but we need to be organised. I'll be sending
<BR>
out a separate mail later listing the problems I've seen us have this
<BR>
release, and ways that can we can improve for in future. The key thing
<BR>
here will be to keep producing the install/release stuff all the way
<BR>
through potato, and not just in the last couple of weeks...
<BR>
<P>Talk to me...
