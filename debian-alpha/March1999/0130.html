<P>Well, what's done is done.  Figured I'd give you a break for a few days at
<BR>
least, though :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Maybe we could also persuade Jason to upgrade albert and stay with the current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stable release for faure. This way it's easy for developers to upload for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stable as well as unstable. Since i have ony one machine...
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds good.  I'm working on getting a new Alpha for the project right now
<BR>
(believe me, from what I can tell, it'll be nice if I can pull it off).
<BR>
If I manage it, it'll be available for all and be running the latest
<BR>
unstable.  In that event, I'll leave my Noname up with 128M RAM (slow, but
<BR>
workable) to build against stable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A.d.n runs always the latest version of unstable AFAIK.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes and no.  I just did an update of it the other day and things were
<BR>
so-so.  I'm going to go back and check it all out and make sure things
<BR>
upgraded ok manually.  You can trust builds on it, but be careful building
<BR>
things with zillions of dependencies.
