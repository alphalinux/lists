<EM>&gt;   A recompile of util-linux solves it for me. My current version is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   working (apt upgrade) and when compiled from source all functions as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   advertised. The reason that I am not uploading this version is, you need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   fiddle with fdisk/partition.h to get the darn thing compiled. Since I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   not uploaded this package before (and do not know what other porters have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   done to compile it), I think it's not wise to upload. I have no ways to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   check fdisk on a spare disk to see if my fix doesn't break it...
</EM><BR>
<P>I just checked, and it appears that I did the upload. And indeed, more
<BR>
doesn't work properly for me either :-(  (I always use less, so I didn't
<BR>
notice earlier).
<BR>
<P>On the fdisk front: all I did was remove the include of partition.h, as
<BR>
it conflicts with the existing partition.h on the system. However, I got
<BR>
mail back from the maintainer that he had added the include on
<BR>
recommendation from Chris (Chris? What's going on there?)  Anyway, fdisk
<BR>
still at least shows me the partitions properly, so I gues it's ok.
<BR>
<P>So, that will fix more. How about the reported vi problems? It's not a
<BR>
problem with vim, I believe, as I haven't noticed anything wrong. So
<BR>
which vi is it...
