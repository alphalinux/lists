<P>Hehehehe...believe me, we all have to wait...especially me, compiling on a
<BR>
UDB (damn good thing I got 128MB RAM now).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   When this hits the archive we have some major catching-up to to. The last
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   time I uploaded for Potato I was quite shocked with the amount of packages
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   that needed to be done or were just plain out-of-date.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Also packages in slink were uploaded to frozen only so it seems.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, I noticed the same.  I was shocked to see the lack of replication
<BR>
from slink to potato.  I guess the scripts are still lousy on master,
<BR>
though, as far as ports go.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   So by the time libc2.1 hits the archive the compile festivities can begin :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed :-)
<BR>
<P>I'll repost a hunk of the FAQ that Joel sent me about some glibc 2.1
<BR>
changes when I finally get the uploads ready.  I also am putting on the
<BR>
web page within the week, which, if you haven't seen it lately, got a
<BR>
small organisational facelift.  I also added a new jpg to it which I like
<BR>
to call &quot;p*ssed off penguin&quot; (hope ya like it...did the modifications
<BR>
myself). :-)
