<P>
my problem has been resolved! thank you to all those who replied!
<BR>
anyways, when i ordered from cpu micro mart, i ordered 32mb of memory.
<BR>
instead of shipping two 16mb simms, they shipped me two 32mb simms. so
<BR>
the memory order was wrong on at least one count. i was hoping that the
<BR>
two 32's would work fine and i'd get 64mb for the price of 32mb, but it
<BR>
appears that wasn't the case. i picked up 2 16's of parity memory from a
<BR>
local shop and now linux is installed ;) however, when i showed them the
<BR>
two 32's from cpu micro mart, they said that those simms where in fact
<BR>
parity. plus, my video worked, and i've been told that the udb won't
<BR>
show any video without parity ram installed. so basically, the problem
<BR>
has been resolved, but i'd like to understand what exactly was
<BR>
happening, if anyone could explain. thanks!
