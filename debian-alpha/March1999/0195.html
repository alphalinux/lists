Hi all...
<BR>
<P>I just uploaded glibc 2.1.1 and the other packages that needed
<BR>
recompiling.  The only one I had problems with was fakeroot, which is
<BR>
needed since libtricks won't work under glibc 2.1.x yet (long story).  I
<BR>
think that fakeroot's problems may be easily fixed by an old patch that I
<BR>
worked out when we were first porting fakeroot to Alphas, so expect that
<BR>
uploaded soon as well.  Bad news is, though, that we have nothing other
<BR>
than sudo again until then :-(
<BR>
<P>At any rate, I found one or two problems that I need to tell everyone
<BR>
about.  First off, I think that the new glibc 2.1.1 *might* kill a
<BR>
pre-existing mail transport package.  I had smail in and now can't seem to
<BR>
get mail off of my Alpha at all.  This could be the intermediate host that
<BR>
I'm going through, but I've seen a similar problem on x86's.  I'm working
<BR>
on recompiling sendmail and smail soon to see if the problem is solved
<BR>
(maybe a reinstallation might do it too).
<BR>
<P>Also, package order is *super* important when installing these things.
<BR>
Best thing that I've found to do is install the new libc6.1 and
<BR>
libncurses4 debs together on one command line.  This avoids a problem with
<BR>
dpkg trying to work using a libncurses that's outdated.
<BR>
<P>Also, apt has been recompiled now.  Please bang on it and make sure things
<BR>
are ok with it.  It's a new version, so I'm not sure if it breaks anything
<BR>
or does anything different.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, my brain is fried.  I'm going to go get some cheese popcorn :-)
<BR>
<P>Let the package compiling begin again :-)
