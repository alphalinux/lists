<EM> &gt; Hi,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I installed Slink yesterday on my XL-300. I did this from an CD set
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; burned from the official Debian-CD images. Some things I noticed:
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; * The Install Guide (install/install.html) suggests that booting
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;   directly from CD is the easiest thing if it is supported by the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;   system -- I believe this is not true. I found the correct descrition
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;   in    the README of /dists/slink/../98-03-05, which isn't that easy
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;   to find. 
</EM><BR>
<P>The doc is still too Intel-centric, CDROM installation on Alpha should 
<BR>
be easy as soon as it is correctly documented which is unfortunately
<BR>
not yet the case.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; * I would have expected the contents of the above directory also in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;   /boot, but there was no root, recsue, etc images.
</EM><BR>
<P>/dists/stable/main/disks-&lt;arch&gt;/current is where you always find the
<BR>
install stuff for every arch, I agree it would be a good to put a
<BR>
symlink of it into /boot/ (altough booting and installing are two
<BR>
different concepts). Will do that in the future.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; * Booting without floppies doesn't seems possible, though the manual
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;   suggests it. I booted linload, MILO and the kernel from CD, but I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;   needed to make a root floppy. I recall that some days ago it was
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;   mentioned on this list to patch the kernel in a way that would make
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;   it possible to load an ordinary file as a ramdisk image. If this is 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;   true, it isn't easily accessible as I havn't found this on the CDs. 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;   If it would be possible, /dists/slinkg ... /98-03-05/root1440.img
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;   isn't exactly in easy to remember name.
</EM><BR>
<P>The README you mentioned is telling to pass the following args to the
<BR>
kernel to boot with or without flooppies:
<BR>
<P>root=/dev/&lt;root-device&gt; load_ramdisk=1 prompt_ramdisk=
<BR>
<P>That is valid even when booting from CD (though prompt_ramdisk is 
<BR>
superfluous then)., in this case:
<BR>
with an SCSI CDROM:
<BR>
root=/dev/scd0 load_ramdisk=1
<BR>
with an IDE-CDROM:
<BR>
root=/dev/hd[bcd] load_ramdisk=1
<BR>
<P>The Cdrom is specially created with knowlegde of where to find the
<BR>
root image in its superblock. So you do not need to specify the path
<BR>
explicitely, just tell the device.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; * It should be stated more clearly, that the path entries in the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;   AlphaBIOS boot menu require backslashes. Also, it should be noted
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;   that only the error message of the OS boot path can be ignored, not
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;   the   one about the loader entry.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok thanks, will correct that.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Well, I don't want to go into the non-Alpha specific issues, but I was
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; suprised to see two emacs versions installed as part of a standard
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; profile (scientific workstation).
</EM><BR>
<P>And even three if you count xemacs, I do not know the rationale for
<BR>
having 2 emacs.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I went to sleep after the installation, so I cannot comment on other
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; issues right now.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks a lot for the feedback.
<BR>
The documentation is still very incomplete, sorry for that.
