Below is part of a reply from Joel Klecker that I got about the big
<BR>
changes in glibc 2.1.x.  This should help all of us determine if/why a
<BR>
package needs to be recompiled.  It should also give everyone interested a
<BR>
bit of insight as to what we've had to contend with and why it took a bit
<BR>
longer than expected :-)
<BR>
<P>----- Forwarded message -----
<BR>
<P>Basically the issue with glibc 2.1 and other libraries is 
<BR>
incompatible changes in libio, symbol versioning is unable to help 
<BR>
with this because it is the structure of FILE that changed.
<BR>
In libstdc++'s case, its ABI changed due to the LFS (Large File 
<BR>
Summit) support in glibc 2.1 (though the libio issue would bite it as 
<BR>
well, if there weren't the LFS issue).
<BR>
In the case of the libraries affected by the libio change, things 
<BR>
only break when trying to link new programs against an old library, 
<BR>
i.e. the resulting executable segfaults immediately at startup.
<BR>
<P>A source compatibility issue that the glibc FAQ doesn't touch on is 
<BR>
programs that detect utmpx.h and assume it is the same as the one in 
<BR>
Solaris, though I have looked at what UNIX98 specifies 
<BR>
(<A HREF="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/utmpx.h.html">http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/utmpx.h.html</A>) for 
<BR>
utmpx.h and glibc conforms with that.
<BR>
<P>Here are a few FAQ entries of interest (note that the sparc and 
<BR>
powerpc ports have addressed most of the source compatibility issues, 
<BR>
though in a lot of cases, the fixes have not been applied by the 
<BR>
maintainer yet):
<BR>
<P>2.27.   What needs to be recompiled when upgrading from glibc 2.0 to glibc
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1?
<BR>
<P>{AJ,CG} If you just upgrade the glibc from 2.0.x (x &lt;= 7) to 2.1, binaries
<BR>
that have been linked against glibc 2.0 will continue to work.
<BR>
<P>If you compile your own binaries against glibc 2.1, you also need to
<BR>
recompile some other libraries.  The problem is that libio had to be
<BR>
changed and therefore libraries that are based or depend on the libio
<BR>
of glibc, e.g. ncurses or slang, need to be recompiled.  If you
<BR>
experience strange segmentation faults in your programs linked against
<BR>
glibc 2.1, you might need to recompile your libraries.
<BR>
<P>Another problem is that older binaries that were linked statically against
<BR>
glibc 2.0 will reference the older nss modules (libnss_files.so.1 instead of
<BR>
libnss_files.so.2), so don't remove them.  Also, the old glibc-2.0 compiled
<BR>
static libraries (libfoo.a) which happen to depend on the older libio
<BR>
behavior will be broken by the glibc 2.1 upgrade.  We plan to produce a
<BR>
compatibility library that people will be able to link in if they want
<BR>
to compile a static library generated against glibc 2.0 into a program
<BR>
on a glibc 2.1 system.  You just add -lcompat and you should be fine.
<BR>
<P>The glibc-compat add-on will provide the libcompat.a library, the older
<BR>
nss modules, and a few other files.  Together, they should make it
<BR>
possible to do development with old static libraries on a glibc 2.1
<BR>
system.  This add-on is still in development.  You can get it from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/glibc-compat-2.1.tar.gz">ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/glibc-compat-2.1.tar.gz</A>
<BR>
but please keep in mind that it is experimental.
<BR>
<P>3.8.    I've got errors compiling code that uses certain string
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;functions.  Why?
<BR>
<P>{AJ} glibc 2.1 has special string functions that are faster than the normal
<BR>
library functions.  Some of the functions are additionally implemented as
<BR>
inline functions and others as macros.  This might lead to problems with
<BR>
existing codes but it is explicitly allowed by ISO C.
<BR>
<P>The optimized string functions are only used when compiling with
<BR>
optimizations (-O1 or higher).  The behavior can be changed with two feature
<BR>
macros:
<BR>
<P>* __NO_STRING_INLINES: Don't do any string optimizations.
<BR>
* __USE_STRING_INLINES: Use assembly language inline functions (might
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;increase code size dramatically).
<BR>
<P>Since some of these string functions are now additionally defined as macros,
<BR>
code like &quot;char *strncpy();&quot; doesn't work anymore (and is unnecessary, since
<BR>
&lt;string.h&gt; has the necessary declarations).  Either change your code or
<BR>
define __NO_STRING_INLINES.
<BR>
<P>{UD} Another problem in this area is that gcc still has problems on machines
<BR>
with very few registers (e.g., ix86).  The inline assembler code can require
<BR>
almost all the registers and the register allocator cannot always handle
<BR>
this situation.
<BR>
<P>One can disable the string optimizations selectively.  Instead of writing
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cp = strcpy (foo, &quot;lkj&quot;);
<BR>
<P>one can write
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cp = (strcpy) (foo, &quot;lkj&quot;);
<BR>
<P>This disables the optimization for that specific call.
<BR>
<P>3.9.    I get compiler messages &quot;Initializer element not constant&quot; with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stdin/stdout/stderr. Why?
<BR>
<P>{RM,AJ} Constructs like:
<BR>
static FILE *InPtr = stdin;
<BR>
<P>lead to this message.  This is correct behaviour with glibc since stdin is
<BR>
not a constant expression.  Please note that a strict reading of ISO C does
<BR>
not allow above constructs.
<BR>
<P>One of the advantages of this is that you can assign to stdin, stdout, and
<BR>
stderr just like any other global variable (e.g. `stdout = my_stream;'),
<BR>
which can be very useful with custom streams that you can write with libio
<BR>
(but beware this is not necessarily portable).  The reason to implement it
<BR>
this way were versioning problems with the size of the FILE structure.
<BR>
<P>To fix those programs you've got to initialize the variable at run time.
<BR>
This can be done, e.g. in main, like:
<BR>
<P>static FILE *InPtr;
<BR>
int main(void)
<BR>
{
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;InPtr = stdin;
<BR>
}
<BR>
<P>or by constructors (beware this is gcc specific):
<BR>
<P>static FILE *InPtr;
<BR>
static void inPtr_construct (void) __attribute__((constructor));
<BR>
static void inPtr_construct (void) { InPtr = stdin; }
<BR>
<P>3.12.   I can't access some functions anymore.  nm shows that they do
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exist but linking fails nevertheless.
<BR>
<P>{AJ} With the introduction of versioning in glibc 2.1 it is possible to
<BR>
export only those identifiers (functions, variables) that are really needed
<BR>
by application programs and by other parts of glibc.  This way a lot of
<BR>
internal interfaces are now hidden.  nm will still show those identifiers
<BR>
but marking them as internal.  ISO C states that identifiers beginning with
<BR>
an underscore are internal to the libc.  An application program normally
<BR>
shouldn't use those internal interfaces (there are exceptions,
<BR>
e.g. __ivaliduser).  If a program uses these interfaces, it's broken.  These
<BR>
internal interfaces might change between glibc releases or dropped
<BR>
completely.
<BR>
<P>3.15.   The sys/sem.h file lacks the definition of `union semun'.
<BR>
<P>{UD} Nope.  This union has to be provided by the user program.  Former glibc
<BR>
versions defined this but it was an error since it does not make much sense
<BR>
when thinking about it.  The standards describing the System V IPC functions
<BR>
define it this way and therefore programs must be adopted.
