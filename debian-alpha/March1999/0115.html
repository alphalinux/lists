<P>
I got hold of a superannuated S3 video card, and thought I'd give it a
<BR>
bash in my UDB (8 bit colour is beginning to get to me...).  After
<BR>
something of a struggle getting it into the box (a rather tight fit) I
<BR>
turned on... and the machine didn't boot all the way up.  It hangs on
<BR>
the black SRM-style screen, saying `loading ARC firmware' (or
<BR>
something similar, don't have it written down), and gets no further.
<BR>
Removing the card fixes the problem, so I haven't disconnected
<BR>
anything or otherwise screwed the box up.  There are no jumpers or
<BR>
anything on the graphics card, so it doesn't seem to be configurable
<BR>
in any way.
<BR>
<P>Does anyone have any idea, just off the top of their head, how I could 
<BR>
fix this?  Failing that, anyone know of a good video card (preferably
<BR>
a nice short one) going cheap in the UK?  Millenium IIs are OK,
<BR>
apparently, does anyone know where I could pick one up?
