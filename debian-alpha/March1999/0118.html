Hello...
<BR>
<P>FYI, I should be uploading final glibc 2.1 debs this week.  I have a few
<BR>
packages to compile before doing so, however (egcs, ncurses, bash, etc).
<BR>
Final go-ahead and announcement will be handled by Joel when he's got
<BR>
every arch's glibc 2.1 debs.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, on to the point...
<BR>
<P>We may want to hold off on uploading anything else for the time being
<BR>
since alot of things will end up getting recompiled against glibc 2.1.
<BR>
<P>I wouldn't have said much, but I saw the volume of things that Bart
<BR>
uploaded this past week or two and figured I'd save him the trouble :-)
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I'll announce the final uploads as well so that we can all begin
<BR>
&quot;the fray&quot; again.
<BR>
<P>C
