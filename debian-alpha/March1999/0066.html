<P>
I previously said:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The slink release has been a mess, culminating in a last-minute &quot;sorry,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we missed it again&quot; announcement. If we're going to release properly next
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Tuesday at 00:00 GMT, then we need a schedule like the following: 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;1. Fixes needed for each set allowed in Tue, Wed, Thu and then _no more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   uploads_ for any reason. At all. None.
</EM><BR>
<P>We've had some fixes going in; we need to decide on actions for the
<BR>
remaining missing/broken packages that have been flagged. Where are we on
<BR>
each platform right now?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;2. Starting _now_ we have people building CD images for each platform.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   These will need to be re-done again later as uploads are made, but we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   need feedback _now_ if there are any missing packages or other CD image
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   problems.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've seen some feedback here, but not very much...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;3. On Friday final images are made for each of the release architectures.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   I can do i386 and source, we need volunteers for m68k, alpha and sparc. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Let us know ASAP if you can help.. Steve, you willing to do sparc still?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   In theory, one person could do all of them, but in practice this just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   does not work. And these need to be sanity checked before we pronounce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   them ready to go. 
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, I'll have i386 and source covered. Steve Dunham has sparc covered
<BR>
(thanks!). M68k/alpha? Anybody? If it comes to the crunch I can _possibly_
<BR>
do these, but I will have no way to test them.
<BR>
<P>And these are still to come.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;4. The 4 image maintainers(?) mail me Friday/Saturday to report progress,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   let me know when we have images ready to go. At that point I get them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   onto cdimage.debian.org so they can be mirrored worldwide ready for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   end of Monday - this takes a _long_ time for ~7GB of image files.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;5. At 00:00 GMT on Tuesday the 9th March we announce release to the world;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   images are already on mirrors ready to be downloaded and those of us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   selling CDs will have copies ready to go in the mail.
</EM><BR>
<P><P><PRE>
