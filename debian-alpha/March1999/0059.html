<EM> &gt; Cool!
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I wonder if this could also be of use to other arch's...
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure there is nothing Alpha specific in the patch.

<P><P><EM> &gt; &gt; in an application_data  field of  the iso volume descriptor (aka 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; super-block). This field is written with a modified isomarkboot.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; Hope it makes sense (at least I have got the first test working).
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Maybe at some later stage mkisofs / mkhybrid could be adapted to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; support this directly? In a way similar to the El Torito boot file
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; image...
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes there is probably something to do with the eltorito spec, however:
<BR>
- it requires to put more complex stuff in the kernel (the super-block
<BR>
point to a boot catalog that needs to be interpreted  to find the
<BR>
right boot image), so to simplify testing for slink, I choosed to
<BR>
minimize the implementation complexity.
<BR>
- eltorito specifies a boot image for i386, Debian/i386 use it with
<BR>
initrd to provide both _kernel_ and ramdisk image. In any case for
<BR>
Alpha, the kernel(and eventually milo) cannot be booted in this way,
<BR>
and what we want is only to specify the root filesystem (so after we
<BR>
already are runing Linux). As this cannot be done in a standard way
<BR>
with the Eltorito spec (AFAIK),  if we cannot follow any standard,
<BR>
it is better to at least keep things simple, and it avoids confusion
<BR>
between what is a ramdisk image and what is a boot image. Maybe the right
<BR>
thing to do is to modify Linux to be able to pass to it an optional
<BR>
full path to a ramdisk image on the command-line, and let it load it,
<BR>
that would work for any filesystem and would provide maximum
<BR>
flexibility without needing to define any other convention. 
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt; Before I generate a new set of kernels with this patch, is the last
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; floppy patch posted by Paul the right one to include?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; It was accepted by Alan Cox for 2.0.37-pre5, so I think it's
</EM><BR>
acceptable :-)
<BR>
<P><P>Cool :-)
<BR>
<P><P><EM> &gt; Doesn't the VGA/TGA display slow down to the speed of the serial port if
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; serial console support is enabled? That would not be nice; it would help
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; if that can be disabled by some boot parameter (or maybe enabled instead?).
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I can build a kernel with serial support and see how that works on my
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; XLT tonight.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I was thinking of the serial-console patch from Miquel van Smoorenburg
<BR>
(standard in 2.2) which allows to choose the console on the
<BR>
command-line (not the existing serial echoing), the serial port is not
<BR>
used at all if not specified on cmd-line (but it will still be
<BR>
initialized in the normal serial driver init routine).
