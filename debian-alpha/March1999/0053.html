<P>
First, I have left aside the idea of booting milo through SRM
<BR>
(altough I finally know how to do it, basically that means running
<BR>
aboot with the OpenVMS palcode, which requires setting maually a
<BR>
virtual to physical mapping). Anyway with SRM, all archs will be able 
<BR>
to boot from the CD anyway thanks to a generic 2.2.2 kernel.
<BR>
<P>Second about the root filesystem, as far as I understand, there was no
<BR>
initrd (or other similar) mechanism that would allow to mount the root
<BR>
filesystem from the CD (except by putting a verbatim filesystem on CD,
<BR>
but that would require changing things in the installation procedure,
<BR>
and diverging from i386, so creating a lot of problems).
<BR>
&nbsp;To implement such a mechanism, I have modified the ramdisk
<BR>
driver, to be able to load a ramdisk not only from a floppy but from
<BR>
any device with a iso9660 image, I  store the offset of the root image
<BR>
in an application_data  field of  the iso volume descriptor (aka 
<BR>
super-block). This field is written with a modified isomarkboot.
<BR>
Hope it makes sense (at least I have got the first test working).
<BR>
<P>Before I generate a new set of kernels with this patch, is the last
<BR>
floppy patch posted by Paul the right one to include?
<BR>
<P>Finally, I have done recently several installation using only the
<BR>
serial port, and there is support to do it in the installation
<BR>
program, but as I have heard some report problems with the serial
<BR>
driver on some archs, I hesitate to recompile the kernels with the
<BR>
serial support inside the kernel, what do you think?
