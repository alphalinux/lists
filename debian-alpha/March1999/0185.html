<P><EM>&gt;   I was wondering how we are getting along on glibc2.1? Does anyone know,

<P>Real Close Now (TM).  I'm compiling it right now.  I had it all compiled
<BR>
yesterday, but it bombed on the make check (with NaN and denormal problems
<BR>
with the libm checks....which I expected but it would finish without it
<BR>
the way it was packaged).  I'm recompiling a new version from Joel right
<BR>
now which should be ok despite the failures.
<BR>
<P>After that, I just have to compile a few libs (ncurses, slang,
<BR>
readline/bash, etc....which shouldn't take more than a day or so) and I'll
<BR>
upload the whole lot together.
<BR>
<P>I'm also working on a binutils release within the week to accompany glibc
<BR>
2.1.  I doubt I'll be able to upload that with the rest (takes too long to
<BR>
compile...would rather get everything else uploaded first).  Right now, I
<BR>
think the binutils release is done, so it won't be long before that is in
<BR>
the archive as well.
