Hi,
<BR>
<P>If you need Alpha CDs I can send out some to Austria and Germany as soon as
<BR>
Slink is updated on my local mirror and I have the first cd images...
<BR>
<P>(If you're in another country you can still contact me... maybe it's
<BR>
possible to ship them to you...)
<BR>
<P>I only do that because it seems to me that there are no commercial resellers
<BR>
here...
<BR>
<P>I do that not for profit. So I'll first look at debian-alpha, create cd's as
<BR>
soon as possible. I can tell you then how much it will cost. (After I
<BR>
produced the first few cd's)
<BR>
<P>I'm using standard cd's which are produced with a TEAC CD-R55S (so they
<BR>
don't have a professional cover or these things.
<BR>
<P>If you're interested please contact me... if you need i386 I can also tell
<BR>
you where to get them... but I'll not burn any of these...
<BR>
<P>Anyone who is interested please contact me...
<BR>
<P>I'll also try to do a 1-cd version which can be used by developers (without
<BR>
all these programs nobody uses or you can download with your modem... (like
<BR>
these 20 x 500kb window managers ;-)) )
<BR>
<P>I can tell you which CDs I can send to you as soon as my local mirror
<BR>
updated... At the moment I can just tell you to contact me and I'll reply as
<BR>
soon as possible...
<BR>
<P>If there's a commercial cd-rom vendor in Austria who produces alpha debian
<BR>
cd's please tell me...
<BR>
<P>cu,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;gerhard
