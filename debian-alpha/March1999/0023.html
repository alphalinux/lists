<EM> &gt; The slink release has been a mess, culminating in a last-minute &quot;sorry, we
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; missed it again&quot; announcement. If we're going to release properly next
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Tuesday at 00:00 GMT, then we need a schedule like the following:
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 1. Fixes needed for each set allowed in Tue, Wed, Thu and then _no more
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;    uploads_ for any reason. At all. None.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 2. Starting _now_ we have people building CD images for each platform.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;    These will need to be re-done again later as uploads are made, but we
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;    need feedback _now_ if there are any missing packages or other CD image
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;    problems.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hi
<BR>
<P>A few improvements for the Alpha CD are really needed, to ensure
<BR>
it is really bootable, I will provide another installation set and
<BR>
slink_cd patches for Tuesday.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; 3. On Friday final images are made for each of the release architectures.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;    I can do i386 and source, we need volunteers for m68k, alpha and sparc. 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;    Let us know ASAP if you can help. Steve, you willing to do sparc still?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;    In theory, one person could do all of them, but in practice this just
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;    does not work. And these need to be sanity checked before we pronounce
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;    them ready to go. 
</EM><BR>
<P>If really nobody is wanting to take the job for Alpha, I can try to also
<BR>
generate the Alpha CDs. Until now, due to resources limitations, I
<BR>
have only been able to test the slink_cd scripts and boot stuff on a
<BR>
small debian subset (I have just asked an account on
<BR>
cdimage.debian.org). 
<BR>
<P><P>Regards,
<BR>
