<P>
Helo everybody,
<BR>
<P>Congratulations to everyone that put efforts into the release.
<BR>
<P>There is now CD images ready on cdimage.debian.org.
<BR>
<P>Of course, I guess it is almost impossible to do a real test of this
<BR>
new CD by downloading it today, but I think it is important that some
<BR>
people checks that in principle it will boot and starts correctly the
<BR>
install procedure for most archs.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;For this purpose I have created small (2 or 3Mbyte) iso images for
<BR>
each arch that you can put on a CD, or on a hardisk or hardisk
<BR>
partition, as they are done in the same way than the real one, they
<BR>
can be used to check that what is on the real CD will work for your
<BR>
arch.
<BR>
<P>The test cases can be download from
<BR>
<A HREF="http://lhpca.univ-lyon1.fr/axp/minicd.html">http://lhpca.univ-lyon1.fr/axp/minicd.html</A> 
<BR>
<P>If there are major problems, that would mean we cannot have a new CD
<BR>
image in time, but that would be much better than having some people
<BR>
and companies pressing CD just to hear a bit later &quot;sorry finally the
<BR>
CD images do not work, you can put them in the trash&quot; :-).
<BR>
<P>So please if you can, try what I put on this page, it should not be
<BR>
long to download, and copy it to a disk or a CDR. That way we can also
<BR>
announce any problem in some release notes, rather than letting the
<BR>
users bump into the eventual problems.
<BR>
<P>Loic
