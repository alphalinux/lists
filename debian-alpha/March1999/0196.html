<P><EM>&gt; I just uploaded glibc 2.1.1 and the other packages that needed

<EM>&gt; recompiling.  The only one I had problems with was fakeroot, which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; needed since libtricks won't work under glibc 2.1.x yet (long story).  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think that fakeroot's problems may be easily fixed by an old patch that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worked out when we were first porting fakeroot to Alphas, so expect that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; uploaded soon as well.  Bad news is, though, that we have nothing other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than sudo again until then :-(
</EM><BR>
<P>Hrm, when you get a working fakeroot I can install glibc2.1 on saens and
<BR>
you guys can start testing things out without wrecking your home systems..
<BR>
But it is pretty useless without a working fakeroot :&lt;
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, package order is *super* important when installing these things.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Best thing that I've found to do is install the new libc6.1 and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; libncurses4 debs together on one command line.  This avoids a problem with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dpkg trying to work using a libncurses that's outdated.
</EM><BR>
<P>Does APT order this installation correctly if you ask it to simply install
<BR>
ibc6.1? We definately should try to get the dependencys/conflicts worked
<BR>
out from the start!
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, apt has been recompiled now.  Please bang on it and make sure things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are ok with it.  It's a new version, so I'm not sure if it breaks anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or does anything different.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm, I belive the latest 0.1 series fixed a small segfault on the alphas,
<BR>
not sure. 0.3.2 should hit incoming soon which I know works on the alpha,
<BR>
I did lots and lots of testing on saens.
