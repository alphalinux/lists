<EM>&gt; because the resolution of weak undefined symbols  occur mostly at

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not exist at compile time, it will never be bind at run-time, and if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it does exists at compile-time, it be equivalent to an undefined one,

<P>Yes, you're right about that, but the logic introduced in the 19990115
<BR>
patch should add regular 'if' conditionals (not preprocessor directives)
<BR>
to test whether or not the weak is supported or not and calls
<BR>
__(de)register_frame_info depending on that.  Prior to the 19990115 patch 
<BR>
(which is currently NOT in our binary egcs package on Alpha, therefore
<BR>
missing the &quot;if&quot;s that I'm talking about), it just calls it since it
<BR>
assumes it should be there regardless.  What I was saying was that the
<BR>
patch adds the needed checks (from what I can tell) to work around the
<BR>
call should it not be there. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So weak symbol does not fill our need for flexibility for the end-user 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (at run-time). Also they have yet another behaviour when used inside a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shared lib, maybe this can be seen as a linker bug. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Could be.  I'll look into this as well after we figure out whether or not
<BR>
the existing patch is workable or not.  I'm hugely busy today...is there
<BR>
any way you could look at the 19990115 patch and code a quick testcase
<BR>
that would behave similarly?  That would solve the argument right there.
