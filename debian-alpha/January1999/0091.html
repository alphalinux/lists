<P><EM>&gt; I don't understand.  Why should we hold up our development solely to let

<EM>&gt; RedHat users run binaries in .deb packages?  It makes no sense to me.
</EM><BR>
<P>Three reasons:
<BR>
1. The Linux community SHOULD work together to provide consistency.  Alot
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of work has been done towards this effect already.
<BR>
2. There already was an i386 issue regarding this where the same
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conclusion was drawn: compatibility can often be a key towards winning
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over users of other distributions.
<BR>
3. On the Alpha especially where RH is the dominant distribution right
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now, sometimes, binaries are only available that may need to be used
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on both distributions.  As it is, I doubt any of us really want to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think that RH packages will run on Debian, but Debian's don't run
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anywhere else but on another Debian system.
<BR>
4. (Ok, I'll add a fourth)  Fixing this issue will definitely help
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;users of older versions of slink that are upgrading.  As it stands,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if they upgrade dpkg, let's say, before libc6.1, it may break package
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;installs of EVERYTHING.
