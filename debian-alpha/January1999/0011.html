<EM>&gt;&gt; In summary, I know I can use the latest glibc 2.0/2.1 from CVS and

<EM>&gt;&gt; compile it with egcs 1.1.1/Linux, but I do not _want_ to be forced to, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; it introduces unecessary requirements in the way systems are

<EM>&gt;You can do whatever you want as long as you don't distribute binaries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nor run binaries compiled on other systems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However, in order to keep binary compatibility between different Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;systems, I am not talking about different Debian machines built by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;different Debian people at different times, it is referring to ALL
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Linux machines based on glibc 2, including RedHat, Debian, ...., it i
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;s mandated to upgrade to the latest glibc 2.0/2.1 and egcs 1.1.1/Linux.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That is one reason we made those changes. It is required. Period.
</EM><BR>
<P>HJ overstates the situation a bit.  We are not doing anything to 2.0,
<BR>
and in fact you should NOT use egcs to compile libc 2.0 unless no
<BR>
other compiler works on the platform in question - that was how the
<BR>
__register_frame_info problem came up in the first place.
<BR>
<P>However, in 2.1, we've decided to insist that libc export
<BR>
__register_frame_info and its friends, so that it isn't defined
<BR>
anywhere else (multiple copies can cause programs to crash).  That
<BR>
means you have to use *some* version of egcs to compile libc 2.1.  You
<BR>
don't have to use HJ's patched egcs 1.1.1.  (In fact, I'd recommend
<BR>
that you don't use it - instead, examine each of his patches and
<BR>
decide whether to apply it yourself.  Some of them are good, some are
<BR>
not.)
<BR>
<P>As long as you use egcs to compile libc 2.1, you can use whatever
<BR>
compiler you like to compile everything else.
