<P>A new gzip has been installed in the archive, so this problem should
<BR>
not occur anymore. For those who have been victim of it in the
<BR>
meantime: here is a possible solution:
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
As soon as you have upgraded to the latest libc in the archive, you
<BR>
will be safe of any trouble. The problem is that you cannot upgrade
<BR>
without gzip, so you need to install manually a new gzip (you could do
<BR>
this for libc, but upgrading libc manually  is a more dangerous
<BR>
experience). 
<BR>
<P>Take a &quot;neutral&quot; gzip (means should run with
<BR>
every libc) on <A HREF="http://www.ens-lyon.fr/~lprylli/axp/">http://www.ens-lyon.fr/~lprylli/axp/</A>
<BR>
<P>Install manually (link to it gunzip, zcat, uncompress).
<BR>
<P>Then dpkg should work, upgrade libc _first_.
<BR>
<P>After libc is upgraded, nothing wrong can happen to your system
<BR>
anymore, feel free to upgrade to any package in the archive.
<BR>
<P>You can also boot from the rescue disk and copy the gzip there  into
<BR>
your normal root filesystem.
