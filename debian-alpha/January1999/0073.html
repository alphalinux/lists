Ok...
<BR>
<P>Geez, I have a headache from this, but it's worth it....
<BR>
<P>Here's what I've gathered from what I understand of what's going on (still
<BR>
waiting for corrections from other parties involved if I happen to be way
<BR>
off base here):
<BR>
<P>Our current version of egcs has a problem with the __register_frame_info
<BR>
stuff, just like the i386 did.  I've confirmed this for sure and should
<BR>
stretch back to anything compiled with egcs-1.1.1 (still not sure if
<BR>
1.0.3a had the problem...can't get the source right now).  In a tiny
<BR>
nutshell, egcs is inserting certain symbols (in fact a whole table) into
<BR>
the startup routine of binaries that are not present in glibc's on some
<BR>
other Alpha installations (namely RedHat), making the binaries unusable on
<BR>
those systems.  In some cases, it means that if a newer libc6.1 package
<BR>
isn't installed on a Debian system during an upgrade, any binary package
<BR>
upgraded before that is probably unusable.
<BR>
<P>Loic, Matthias, and I are working on a solution that requires us to test
<BR>
three different scenarios before figuring out which work and which is
<BR>
best.  I'm kinda gambling on HJL's latest patch (19990115) being
<BR>
&quot;workable&quot; and ok since the reasoning in the patch seems pretty sound.  I
<BR>
also don't want to trade off any exception-handling benefits that the
<BR>
patch provides by just saying &quot;this is bad...take it out&quot;.
<BR>
<P>What does this mean to everyone?
<BR>
<P>This is hard part...basically, no matter what we come up with, it looks
<BR>
like we're going to have to recompile alot of packages (anything compiled
<BR>
since 1.1.1 was uploaded).  BUT, don't start right now.  Until we get some
<BR>
fixed debs for egcs up to master, any recompilation is moot.  Also, Bart,
<BR>
Paul, and everyone else uploading Alpha packages: if you can help it,
<BR>
please hold all uploads until the fixed egcs otherwise you'll end up
<BR>
recompiling it anyway (most likely).  I still recommend porting and
<BR>
finding out if things work ok or not (keep making diffs for the BTS if
<BR>
needed), but wait on the final deb compilation for upload until egcs is
<BR>
fixed.
<BR>
<P>I'll be working on this ALOT in the next few days (hope my RL boss doesn't
<BR>
notice...hehehe), but we WILL resolve it...
<BR>
<P>Thanks...
