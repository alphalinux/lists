<EM> &gt;  &gt; I have tried the gdb from (Mikolaj J. Habryn) and got the following

<EM> &gt; Just the question which Debian version of egcs do you use? The current 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; one is egcs-1.1.1-4.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes I have tried the latest source from debian/slink
<BR>
<P><P><EM> &gt; In 2.91.60-4 there is another HLU patch to bring it to his egcs Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; release. Please tell me if I should leave out the hjl-12 patch.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have seen the 0hjl-19990115-linux patch that add the weak
<BR>
declarations.
<BR>
That was exactly what I was referring to when I said:
<BR>
<EM> &gt;  &gt; I think the  right solution is to patch the crtbegin file in egcs, to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  &gt; include a weak  prototype of [de]register_frame_info, setting it to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  &gt; a dummy function. Looking at the code I think this was the intention
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  &gt; of the author to do something similar because he included weak prototypes
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  &gt; of the symbol, and do not call the function int them if they point to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  &gt; &quot;zero&quot;. But he forgot to actually put a default definition, so the weak
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  &gt; protype is ingored in this cases.
</EM><BR>
<P>My point is that the last HLU patch looks buggy because it creates a weak
<BR>
undefined symbol, which does not solve anything (it is considered by
<BR>
the ld-linux.so as an undefined one). We need a real weak
<BR>
symbol with a real default definition. I just propose to complete it
<BR>
by adding the default definition. No need to remove the hlu-12 patch
<BR>
which I suppose was created to fill some needs (I trust HLU for that).
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; HLU told me, that it would be sufficient to recompile glibc with the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; egcs-1.1.1 Linux release.
</EM><BR>
<P>Unless I missed something (maybe there is some ugly hack to transform a
<BR>
weak undefined symbol into a weak symbol defined as zero in some
<BR>
binutils  or ldso release),it does not work. Moreover the problem
<BR>
is not really the libc per se which is fine, but the executables that
<BR>
depends on the  symbol (and that creates a unwanted dependency on the
<BR>
latest Debian libc).
<BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; In gcc/config/t-linux all symbols are defined which should not be
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; exported to shared libs.
</EM><BR>
<P>Do you mean exported _by_ shared libs? I am not sure I understand this 
<BR>
mechanism, but I do not feel it could solve our problem, we certainly
<BR>
want register_frame_info to be a normal &quot;overloadable&quot; symbol.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
