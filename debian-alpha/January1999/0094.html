<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't understand.  Why should we hold up our development solely to let
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; RedHat users run binaries in .deb packages?  It makes no sense to me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Three reasons:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1. The Linux community SHOULD work together to provide consistency.  Alot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    of work has been done towards this effect already.
</EM><BR>
<P>Certainly.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2. There already was an i386 issue regarding this where the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    conclusion was drawn: compatibility can often be a key towards winning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    over users of other distributions.
</EM><BR>
<P>Certainly there too.  So we hold up the distro to get the fixed compiler in. 
<BR>
But I don't see why we need to hold it up so that recompiled .debs get in.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3. On the Alpha especially where RH is the dominant distribution right
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    now, sometimes, binaries are only available that may need to be used
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    on both distributions.  As it is, I doubt any of us really want to
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think that RedHat people want/need to use .debs, just as I don't
<BR>
want/need to use RPMs.  Fixing the compiler is fine, but again, I fail to
<BR>
see the advantage for us to hold things up to &quot;fix&quot; the debs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    think that RH packages will run on Debian, but Debian's don't run
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    anywhere else but on another Debian system.
</EM><BR>
<P>If generic programs compiled by someone using Debian don't run elsewhere,
<BR>
that could be a problem.  So we fix the compiler.  But hold up the distro
<BR>
because other debs were compiled with that compiler?  I don't think so.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 4. (Ok, I'll add a fourth)  Fixing this issue will definitely help
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    users of older versions of slink that are upgrading.  As it stands,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    if they upgrade dpkg, let's say, before libc6.1, it may break package
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    installs of EVERYTHING.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is probably the only good argument, but anyway, the dependencies should
<BR>
take care of that, right?
