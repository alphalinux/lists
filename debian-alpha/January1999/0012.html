<EM> &gt; &gt; In summary, I know I can use the latest glibc 2.0/2.1 from CVS and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; compile it with egcs 1.1.1/Linux, but I do not _want_ to be forced to, 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; it introduces unecessary requirements in the way systems are
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; upgraded, and in the circulation of binaries between systems.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; You can do whatever you want as long as you don't distribute binaries
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; nor run binaries compiled on other systems.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok, sorry I was not clear, my concern was not about me, but about
<BR>
debian users. And all this thread is not about the egcs that I
<BR>
will use, but about the egcs that will go in the next standard
<BR>
Debian/Alpha distribution (I am a debian developer).
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; However, in order to keep binary compatibility between different Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; systems, I am not talking about different Debian machines built by
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; different Debian people at different times, it is referring to ALL
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Linux machines based on glibc 2, including RedHat, Debian, ...., it i
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; s mandated to upgrade to the latest glibc 2.0/2.1 and egcs 1.1.1/Linux.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; That is one reason we made those changes. It is required. Period.
</EM><BR>
<P>I am glad you also want to ensure binary compatibility on ALL machines 
<BR>
based on glibc 2, so let's look at the situation:
<BR>
&nbsp;Alpha glibc2 systems I know:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Redhat 5.0,5.1,5.2 (the latest as far as I know)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lx-~$cat /etc/redhat-release 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Hat Linux release 5.2 (Apollo)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lx-~$nm --dynamic /lib/libc-2.0.7.so  | grep register_fr
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lx-~$gcc -v
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/alpha-redhat-linux/egcs-2.90.29/specs
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;gcc version egcs-2.90.29 980515 (egcs-1.0.3 release)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;2)  Debian/Alpha (that altough never officially released has a number
<BR>
&nbsp;of users)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It  did either  have register_frame_info in its libc until
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;recently.
<BR>
<P><P>So to ensure binary-compatibility executables should not depend on
<BR>
the register_frame_info function.
<BR>
<P>Let be sure there is no misunderstanding: I fully understand all libc
<BR>
starting from now must include register_frame_info, what I want to check
<BR>
is that C-only executables do not _rely_ on it. So all I am
<BR>
concerned about, is the crtbegin.o shipped with egcs and not libc itself.

</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 08048ca4      DF *UND*  000000a8 __deregister_frame_info
</EM><BR>
<P>That's the kind of executables that would be better to avoid if
<BR>
possible,  your gcc will probably not run on a standard Redhat5.2
<BR>
system (ok, it isn't important in the particular case of gcc, but not
<BR>
for other executables).

<EM> &gt; &gt; In 2.91.60-4 there is another HLU patch to bring it to his egcs Linux

<EM> &gt; &gt; release. Please tell me if I should leave out the hjl-12 patch.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Wait a second. My egcs-1.1.1.diff.12 is removed from the final egcs

</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Please don't use any previous patches.
</EM><BR>
<P>Can you clarify a few point about your official egcs-1.1.1-19990115-linux.
<BR>
First  are the binary really available? I could not find them on the sites mentioned in
<BR>
your announcement (<A HREF="http://www.linuxhq.com/lnxlists/linux-gcc/lg_9901/msg00061.html">http://www.linuxhq.com/lnxlists/linux-gcc/lg_9901/msg00061.html</A>).
<BR>
<P>Then the config/alpha/crtbegin.asm does not make any reference to
<BR>
register_frame_info, which would be perfect for Debian (preserve binary
<BR>
compatibility). But this is inconsistent with  the result that you mentioned
<BR>
previously with &quot;objdump --dynamic-sym /usr/bin/gcc&quot; (and also inconsistent
<BR>
with other archs that AFAIK generate crtbegin.o from crtstuff.c).
<BR>
when I  recompile a pristine egcs-1.1.1-19990115-linux with itself I do not find
<BR>
the register-frame_info symbol in the result? The output of crtbegin.o for
<BR>
a pristine egcs-1.1.1-19990115-linux here is:
<BR>
0000000000000000 a *ABS*
<BR>
0000000000000000 ? __CTOR_LIST__
<BR>
0000000000000000 ? __DTOR_LIST__
<BR>
0000000000000000 t __do_global_dtors_aux
<BR>
<P>Is it consistent with yours? Does your gcc/config/crtbegin.asm mention 
<BR>
register_frame_info?

<EM> &gt; HJ overstates the situation a bit.  We are not doing anything to 2.0,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and in fact you should NOT use egcs to compile libc 2.0 unless no
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; other compiler works on the platform in question - that was how the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; __register_frame_info problem came up in the first place.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; However, in 2.1, we've decided to insist that libc export
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; __register_frame_info and its friends, so that it isn't defined
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; anywhere else (multiple copies can cause programs to crash).  That
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; means you have to use *some* version of egcs to compile libc 2.1.  You
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; don't have to use HJ's patched egcs 1.1.1.  (In fact, I'd recommend
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; that you don't use it - instead, examine each of his patches and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; decide whether to apply it yourself.  Some of them are good, some are
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; not.)
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually the inclusion of register_frame_info in libc seems to have
<BR>
been backported to 2.0 according to the ChangeLog. Anyway I repeat
<BR>
again that since the beginning my only concern is about what should be
<BR>
in crtbegin.o (my point being it should not contain an undefined
<BR>
reference to register_frame_info but a weak definition of it, in order
<BR>
to preserve binary compatibility between systems).
