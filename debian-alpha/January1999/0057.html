<EM> &gt; Ok...the prior messages must have confused me.  I'm going to see how this
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; build of egcs goes (it's running now).  So, let's see if my dense mind
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; gets it this time: apply HJL's &quot;12&quot; patch AND the one you sent, right?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem is that there is several possible choices, that would make
<BR>
sense. The last one you mention is only one of several, and I am too
<BR>
little knowledge about gcc/egcs to say which ay we can choose. (maybe
<BR>
only part of the HJL's &quot;12&quot; patch shoudl be applied or none at all),
<BR>
<P>The choice that seems to be recommended by HJL was to just take the
<BR>
last diff he maintains against egcs1.1.1, and do not apply anything
<BR>
else. Well I guess the egcs Debian maintainers put others
<BR>
patches for some reasons, so it may be better to take them into
<BR>
account.
<BR>
<P>It sould be easier if someone who is familiar with egcs and the HJL
<BR>
patches could shed some light on the following issues:
<BR>
<P>1) In the patches that makes crtbegin.o depends on
<BR>
register_frame_info, there is a tentative try to declare this undefined
<BR>
symbol as weak, which seems to me a dumb thing to do when a symbol is
<BR>
undefined (because as far as I can tell the weak declaration has no
<BR>
effect afterwards). I would be more happy to understand why I am the
<BR>
stupid one in this regard, and what I missed that makes a undefined
<BR>
weak symbol different from a regular undefined one in some situations.
<BR>
<P><P>2) HLU suggests to remove the register_frame_info reference from
<BR>
crtbegin.o. Just to satisfy my technical curiosity, why is it not
<BR>
possible to do this in a uniform manner between platforms, in
<BR>
particular why couldn't we remove the calls from crtstuff.c which is
<BR>
used for the x86 crtbegin.o? Moreover, if it is possible to remove this
<BR>
call on Alpha, by what are they replaced, (or if nothing replace them,
<BR>
for what purpose were there introduced  in the first place)? From what 
<BR>
I understand they are related to C++ exception handling, but that is
<BR>
mean removing them will have any effect on C++ exception handling?
<BR>
<P>In conclusion, I am sorry, but I am at a loss to recommend what
<BR>
exactly shoudl be done, except this is an important issue because one
<BR>
user has already render its system unusable (or at least gzip/gunzip
<BR>
which are quite critical components, in particular they would be
<BR>
unfortunately needed to solve the problem by upgrading).
<BR>
