<EM> &gt; I'm a little worried that we don't have up-to-date boot-floppies for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Alpha and Sparc.  Is there a plan to release these platforms a little
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; later than the x86 (and m68k?) release date?
</EM><BR>
<P>This only my personal opinion, but I feel for the Alpha, releasing it
<BR>
one or two weeks after x86 would make sense. Changes in the 
<BR>
source packages can sometimes introduce problems on the Alpha, so
<BR>
there is no way we can be exactly in sync (other than setting x86 on
<BR>
hold once it is finished).
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Are there parties actively working on this for release?  I don't see a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; lot of activity.  I know Loic Prylli is working on the Alpha stuff but
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; haven't seen any patches or builds for a while.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually the main reason a new boot-floppies for Alpha has not been
<BR>
done is technical, the register_frame_info problems that occured on
<BR>
x86 with egcs have appeared with a slighlty different timing (because
<BR>
the problematic code involved in the source is not the same for x86
<BR>
and alpha, and was not intiduced at the same time in the upstream
<BR>
code), and in a different way (as egcs is our main compiler, and
<BR>
reverting to gcc is not an option).  The good thing is that the
<BR>
problem is basically solved. But as this problem had an impact about
<BR>
every exectuable generated, I did not try generate installation disks
<BR>
with &quot;non-standard&quot; executables.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; I wouldn't mind having a cushion time after i386/m68k release to try to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; get the documentation up to snuff for sparc/alpha.  I've currently had
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; no time (and no patches submitted to me) to even put in the existing
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; platform documentation scattered around.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Thoughts?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, Alpha documentation is still poor, that is the other reason
<BR>
releasing it only one week or two after the other would make sense.
<BR>
