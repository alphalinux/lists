Hello everybody, 
<BR>
<P>I have tried the gdb from (Mikolaj J. Habryn) and got the following
<BR>
error:
<BR>
<P>./gdb: error in loading shared libraries
<BR>
<EM>: undefined symbol: __deregister_frame_info
</EM><BR>
<P>Contrary to what has been said previously, the _register_frame_info
<BR>
problem  is probably  a serious issue even on Alpha, it is a matter of 
<BR>
backwards compatibility and binary compatibility with other
<BR>
Linux/Alpha systems (on i386 the fact egcs cannot be used to compile
<BR>
the libc or other shared lib should be also corrected). 
<BR>
<P>I am not an expert on these issues so I may be wrong but I have
<BR>
observed that:
<BR>
- we have HLU patches added to egcs so that in 
<BR>
gcc-lib/.../crtbegin.o, there is some init code to register (via
<BR>
a call to __register_frame_info) a structure related to C++ exception
<BR>
handling.
<BR>
crtbegin.o is linked in every shared lib and in every executable (even 
<BR>
those that do not contain any C++ code).
<BR>
- the function __register_frame_info is defined in libgcc.a(frame.o)
<BR>
- libc is linked with libgcc.a and so define __register_frame_info if
<BR>
compiled with the last gcc package
<BR>
- every executable linked with our current libc will assume
<BR>
register_frame_info is defined in libc and will not put it into the
<BR>
executable, and it will depends on this symbol.
<BR>
- if the executable is run on a system where libc has  not compiled with 
<BR>
out customegcs, it will fail with the  &quot;undefined symbol:
<BR>
__deregister_frame_info&quot; error. That means we cannot run binaries
<BR>
compiled on Debian on Redhat, and if even Debian people will render
<BR>
their system unusable if they do not upgrade their libc before any
<BR>
package compiled with the current egcs/libc combination. They are no
<BR>
dependencies present to take account of that.
<BR>
<P>I think the  right solution is to patch the crtbegin file in egcs, to
<BR>
include a weak  prototype of [de]register_frame_info, setting it to
<BR>
a dummy function. Looking at the code I think this was the intention
<BR>
of the author to do something similar because he included weak prototypes
<BR>
of the symbol, and do not call the function int them if they point to
<BR>
&quot;zero&quot;. But he forgot to actually put a default definition, so the weak
<BR>
protype is ingored in this cases.
<BR>
<P>Here is a patch, what he should solve:
<BR>
- binaries compatibility should be ensured with other systems
<BR>
- while upgrading their system, current debian users do not risk to
<BR>
render it unbootable.
<BR>
<P>I think we should try to find any package (or at least in the base
<BR>
system) with an executable or a shared lib depending on the
<BR>
[de]register_frame_info symbols and recompile them with  egcs patched
<BR>
as below. 
<BR>
<P>The good thing is that even executables compiled under the bad
<BR>
egcs/libc combination will run under such a new libc/egcs as the libc will
<BR>
include a weak definition of the symbol. So this would correspond to a 
<BR>
&quot;be generous in what executables you accept, and be careful in what you 
<BR>
generate&quot;
<BR>
<P><P>Any comments? We probably need a news gcc ASAP.
<BR>
<P>Loic
<BR>
<P>here is the patch (must be applied after the other ones of the Debian 
<BR>
source), for x86 a similar modif shoudl be made in crtstuff.c :
