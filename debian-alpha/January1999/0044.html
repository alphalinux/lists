<EM>&gt; &gt; I patched smail for alignments errors and send the patch to the maintainer.

<EM>&gt; Hmm, you should have sent the patch to the BTS, that way there is some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; form of record that you did it. Now he could claim he never received
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it, if he wanted to be evil :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Nope, he can't deny it... I wrongly suspected a poroblem in libc and talked to
<BR>
chris as well. When I notified the maintainer I cc.-ed chris as well. The
<BR>
patch I've suggested is not the exactely I send him. There are some
<BR>
adjustments to make them compatible for x86 (no change there).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Since I got no response this month I think he is not going to incorporate it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for us. Do you think I should do a binary-only NMU and send the patch to BTS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or wait until the maintainer picks up on this (eventually sending a bug when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; he still doesn't respond)??
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd do a sourceful NMU, if the maintainer hasn't responded for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; month... Be kind and also upload an i386 version if you can :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll send the patch to BTS (incl a bug), do a source-full NMU with i386
<BR>
included. I hope to do it tonight but am not sure i have the time...
<BR>
<P><P>Thanks,

<P>B.
<BR>
<P>NB: There are also a lot of alignment traps in gs. I am looking into these as
<BR>
well. If I have a solution I will come back on this.
