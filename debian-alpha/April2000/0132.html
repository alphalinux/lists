<EM>&gt; &gt; My mistake.  I was trying to install on a serial console machine, it boots fine on an LX164 with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; video card.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yeah, that's a known issue.  The problem is that the kernel does not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; detect whether it has been booted from a serial console or not, and so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it will send output to the screen unless you give it a &quot;console=ttyS0&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (or whichever serial port) argument on the kernel command line.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh yeah, forgot about the console boot arg.  Sorry, I'll try that tomorrow.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The goal is eventually to do this guessing either in the bootloader or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the kernel.  This is tricky to do in aboot because the CTB (console
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; terminal block) is seriously underspecified.  (I speculate that this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is because many (most?) implementations of SRM take input on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; serial port *and* the keyboard if both are present, though they only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sends output to one at a time).  It should be pretty easy to do in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MILO since MILO is actually a console rather than a bootloader :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Cool.  Or have the user specify &quot;console=&quot; in the args at the MILO prompt, though that would make the boot line a
<BR>
good bit more complicated than &quot;boot fd0:&quot;.  But those brave enough to do a serial console install will get over
<BR>
it. :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The 2.0.36 slink kernel showed startup message on the serial port, can that option be turned on for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; potato too?  I realize it may require a different root image, as did slink...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hm, that's interesting.  So 2.0 would automatically detect a serial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; console?  Or was there a separate boot disk for it?  (I seem to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remember that there was no &quot;console on serial port&quot; config option in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.0)
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup.  I use the same slink rescue floppy, and same boot args, for LX164 with kb/video card as with serial port,
<BR>
though the root image is different, see the &quot;Headless install...&quot; thread on this list of 11/22/99.  Somehow, it
<BR>
knows to print the startup messages to the right place, and prompt for the root image in the right place too.
<BR>
Pretty cool.

<P>Great, thanks very much!
<BR>
<P>I still need to get around to checking the Alpha MILO documentation in boot-floppies (and adding a serial console
<BR>
piece :-), might happen sometime next week...
