Hello all,
<BR>
<P>There are serious issues with the .debs of tcl8.2 and tk8.2 in frozen
<BR>
(both at version 8.2.3-2). I'm hacking out a project that involves
<BR>
using Tk to create a GUI, and the canvas widget exhibits lots and lots
<BR>
of strange bugs. This does _not_ occur on x86 machines running the
<BR>
same version of Tcl/Tk. This does _not_ occur on my Alpha box after I
<BR>
recompiled an official Scriptics source package of 8.2.3. I have not
<BR>
tried playing with the source .debs (mainly because I know next to
<BR>
nothing about dpkg internals), but this definitely needs to be
<BR>
rebuilt for a release of potato.
<BR>
<P>If anyone wants specifics about what is broken, I can provide that
<BR>
information. However, since my hand-built Tcl/Tk works fine, I assume
<BR>
that the problem occurred somewhere on the end of the Debian Alpha
<BR>
builders.
<BR>
<P>I ran a vanilla ./configure script, with no special flags. I did not
<BR>
include the 64bit flag, since 8.2 doesn't seem to work properly with
<BR>
it on Alpha Linux. (It seems to be fine on 8.3.)
<BR>
<P>On a related note, is there a reason that Tcl/Tk in Debian has the
<BR>
version number hardcoded? It's always been tcl4.0, tcl7.6, and now
<BR>
it's tcl8.0 and tcl8.2. The latest version of Tcl/Tk is backwards
<BR>
compatible, so why not just have a tcl package and a tk package that
<BR>
is upgraded at the same rate as the Scriptics folks release their
<BR>
goods?
<BR>
<P>---Constantine Vetoshev
