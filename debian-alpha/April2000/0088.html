<P><P><EM>&gt; No.  You need to make a MILO disk yourself now though, those MILO
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disks were taking up too much space in the archive.  It's pretty easy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just copy the MILO binary (i.e. MILO/ruffian) and linload.exe to a FAT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; floppy then boot with 'ruffian' as the OSLOADPATH.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Just to add fuel to the fire... :)
<BR>
<P>Does linload.exe work on the ruffian (UX) board? I tried
<BR>
it yesterday, and it really wasn't happy at all. It wouldn't
<BR>
do anything, and when I pressed a key, I got a prompt to
<BR>
go back to ARCSBIOS. In the end, I grabbed ldmilo.exe from
<BR>
gatekeeper.dec.com, and used that to boot the milo (renamed
<BR>
from ruffian to milo).
<BR>
<P>You may also want to check the root.bin image on
<BR>
www.debian.org/~dhd/, as it wouldn't work for me... I suspect
<BR>
the download may have been dodgy.. but when I recreated
<BR>
the root disk on a loop back floopy image, and wrote that,
<BR>
it booted okay...
<BR>
<P>It finished downloading all the deb's this morning, so
<BR>
I should have fun configuring them all this evening...
<BR>
<P>Oh, and have the problems with C++ programs gone away? I had
<BR>
problems with blackbox corrupting the screen when I moved
<BR>
windows around, which didn't happen with RedHat 6.1.
<BR>
<P>L.
