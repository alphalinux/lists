Hi,
<BR>
<P>does it have any bad effects, if the install procedure &quot;thinks&quot; that it
<BR>
is year 2020? Under the freshly installed potato system the year is set
<BR>
correctly to 2000, just that already heavily discussed time thing
<BR>
strikes: My computer is 2 hours early. Since I &quot;trained&quot; the Debian
<BR>
install with slink base first, before installing potato, I´ve seen the
<BR>
same phenomenon during install of slink (year 2020).
<BR>
<P>Besides that, I ran into a loop when installing potato (on an LX164,
<BR>
AlphaBIOS 5.66). It stayed stuck at the part &quot;installing system and
<BR>
kernel modules&quot; (Cannot recall the exact words right now). At first, I
<BR>
thought, that it was caused by an error in drivers.tgz, since that
<BR>
message showed up. To overcome this I switched to floppies with
<BR>
driver1.bin and driver2.bin, this time without error message, but it
<BR>
still did not change to the next item of the install procedure. Finally,
<BR>
I simply had a look whether the kernel was already installed, chose some
<BR>
additional settings like networking stuff manually in the install menu
<BR>
and simply rebooted the system ignoring the loop. After adding an
<BR>
apropriate line in the AlphaBIOS the system started up, seemingly
<BR>
without problems. But at the moment I´ve got only the base installed, so
<BR>
it hasn´t been tested too much. 
<BR>
<P>Is this behaviour of the install procedure a bug which still needs to be
<BR>
fixed or did something go wrong with my specific install on my computer?
<BR>
<P><P>Regards,
<BR>
<P>Kerstin
