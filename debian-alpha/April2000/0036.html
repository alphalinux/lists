What's this about?  w seems to give good info, but whoami has trouble,
<BR>
and only over NIS, and on ARM and Alpha but not Intel.  Also, when I try
<BR>
to ssh anywhere from such machines (as UID 1001), it says &quot;You don't
<BR>
exist, go away!&quot; even for ssh user@machine.  Started on Monday (at the
<BR>
latest), and potato upgrades to date have not fixed it (well, haven't
<BR>
upgraded potato on ARM since Tuesday because of the binutils problem).
<BR>
<P>Known bug?  Or should I file a bug report against shellutils, or nis, or
<BR>
both?  Or might it be some obscure libc6 thing?  Seems at least
<BR>
&quot;important&quot; in severity, and on some pretty important packages!
<BR>
<P>Zeen,
<BR>
<P>-Adam P.
