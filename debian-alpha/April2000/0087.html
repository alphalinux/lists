Hi all...
<BR>
<P>Over the past week, I've been attempting to find a version of ldconfig
<BR>
that actually works as advertised on Alpha.  Well, what I concluded
<BR>
was...there isn't one.  The current implementation in the ld.so package
<BR>
loves 32-bit ELF, but has no clue about 64-bit ELF.  This is what's been
<BR>
breaking the ncpfs package compilation all of this time (ldconfig can't
<BR>
read the SONAME out of the library, so it doesn't set up links).  Doing
<BR>
ALOT of debugging on ldconfig shows that it's really not doing anything
<BR>
for us at all.
<BR>
<P>So, I started trying to patch it for 64-bit ELF support (or actually, more
<BR>
generic ELF support), but it just isn't going well.  I'm lacking the time
<BR>
to properly handle this one (even though I'm probably the best one to
<BR>
handle it, unfortunately).  I'm leaning towards a complete rewrite at this
<BR>
stage, which would probably benefit the entire Linux community...
<BR>
<P>I would file a bug report, but I remember that not going over so well in
<BR>
the past (thus the split and the ldconfig package awhile back).
<BR>
<P>Anyone wanna lend a hand and take a look at this for me?  I'd greatly
<BR>
appreciate it.
<BR>
<P>Think I will file a bug in the meantime, but I doubt that the maintainer
<BR>
can do much about it ATM.
<BR>
<P>Thanks a ton!
<BR>
C
<BR>
