<P>
<EM>&gt; On Apr 20, Paul Slootman scratched in indelible ink :
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What version were you using? I don't have any problem whatsoever;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have 1.15.2-1 installed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
same version as what I have
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Note that the strace you sent was useless, as the problem was in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; process that couldn't be straced (setuid). Maybe running strace as root
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be better, although strace output is extremely verbose and not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well suited to mailing lists, a web location might be better.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Often ltrace is better for debugging. However, unfortunately it doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compile on alpha :-( :-(
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
hmmm yes.  Point taken  I will do different next time.  However, the second
<BR>
one that I sent was done as root, and was *much* more verbose.  I had a good
<BR>
look through it myself but could not find anything that looked obviously
<BR>
wrong.  anyway, it works now, and there has been no response from other
<BR>
people, so it looks like I was the only one having problems.
<BR>
<P>/Jp.
