<P>
<EM>&gt; It was conjecture.  BTW, how are you all handling the ldconfig issue for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha?  Ever notice that ldconfig is just plain broken?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm currently using RH 6.x, about to switch to Debian. On RH, ldconfig
<BR>
seems to work as expected.
<BR>
<P>I'm not an expert on this, but when I run ldconfig for updateing after
<BR>
installing new libraries, it works. At least the programs that requires
<BR>
those libraries works just fine afterwards (they didn't before the run).
<BR>
<P>It also seems to work just fine when I see it invoked from different
<BR>
install scripts.
