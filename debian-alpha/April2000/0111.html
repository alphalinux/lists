<P>Hmmmm...that's odd because none of the patches that I've found in the RH
<BR>
source RPMs seem to fix the problem -- that ldconfig doesn't know anything
<BR>
about 64-bit BFDs.  ldconfig is bound to be used by alot of postinstall
<BR>
scripts, but whether it works properly or not is the question (I'm left
<BR>
wondering if they're hacking it specifically for Alpha or if they are
<BR>
providing general BFD support for all archs, as should be provided by
<BR>
ldconfig -- I haven't found a patch to do either in RedHat's source
<BR>
archive).
