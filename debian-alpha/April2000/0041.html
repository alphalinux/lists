Hmm.  I am using a Netwinder (ARM) as NIS master, and a PC as slave.
<BR>
Both using the most current 'unstable'.  This problem does not exist
<BR>
there.  Maybe potato-specific?
<BR>
<P>Have you been logged in since Tuesday?  I.e. did you log in before
<BR>
doing some change on your system, and have not yet logged out?
<BR>
Is UID 1001 one that is exported through NIS, or is it local to the
<BR>
machine you are running 'ssh' from?
<BR>
<P>- Try 'ypmatch 1001 passwd.byuid'.
<BR>
- On your client machine, make sure the master is visible: 'ypwhich'
<BR>
- Make sure /etc/defaultdomain contains your NIS domain name.
<BR>
- Also try restarting NIS, in both places: '/etc/init.d/nis restart'
<BR>
