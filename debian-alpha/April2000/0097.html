<P><EM>&gt; I believe it does ok with that, but I haven't even delved into that

<EM>&gt; segment yet.  It may not, considering it can't even parse the BFD

<EM>&gt; structure, from what I can tell....

<P>Hum.  Okay, I'll look at it ... I'm delving a bit into ELF stuff for
<BR>
aboot so I might as well.

<P><EM>&gt; I'm very happy that we're really using gcc.  I never liked egcs much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; except for the fact that it actually worked on Alpha...
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, I'm actually pretty happy with it nowadays.  It still does some
<BR>
weird things, but it's been getting quite a lot better.
<BR>
<P>It looks like 2.96 fixes almost all of our bugs (except the really
<BR>
weird ones like the misoptimization stuff), but it still segfaults a
<BR>
lot :(
