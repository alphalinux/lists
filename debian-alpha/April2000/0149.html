<P><EM>&gt; I still get segfaults in nmap and several other programs. I also still

<EM>&gt; have problems with licq and gnomeicu. I would have thought these would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have been fixed by now... Does anyone have any suggestions? 
</EM><BR>
<P>You should follow proper bug reporting procedure - figure out how to
<BR>
reproduce the segfaults, then file bugs against the packages.  If you
<BR>
can track down the actual bug and produce a patch, then that's great,
<BR>
but it's not necessary.
<BR>
<P>It's more important to have accurate information on how to reproduce a
<BR>
bug than possibly incorrect speculation on the cause of the bug or a
<BR>
possibly incorrect patch (the GCC bug reporting guidelines are a must
<BR>
read for everyone).
<BR>
<P>In my experience these sorts of things are either:
<BR>
<P>1) Non-Alpha-related bugs in the programs that don't manifest
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves on i386 purely out of chance (uninitialized auto
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;variables seem to cause this a lot, as do some buffer overruns)
<BR>
<P>2) 64-bit-uncleanliness bugs, which are usually easily fixed by making
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the program actually use a 32-bit type where it needs a 32-bit
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type.  These can sometimes be fairly subtle in the case where
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people are making assumptions about the sizes of system types.
<BR>
<P>3) Other bugs related to some features of Linux on Alpha that are just
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;different from i386 (usually OSF/1 compatibility stuff)
<BR>
<P>4) Compiler bugs :-(  (these are actually less frequent than you'd think)
<BR>
<P>These are mostly easy to solve with the exception of (4)...
