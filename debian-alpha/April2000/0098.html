<P><EM>&gt; Hum.  Okay, I'll look at it ... I'm delving a bit into ELF stuff for

<P>Fantastic.  Let me know if you need anything from me.  OH, a good starting
<BR>
point, is this: ldconfig is actually being made from readelf.c (and
<BR>
readelf.h) and ldconfig.c.  If you look at the binutils' source, in the
<BR>
binutils dir, the file: readelf.c is what they based the readelf.c in
<BR>
ld.so on.  It might give you some insight...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yeah, I'm actually pretty happy with it nowadays.  It still does some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weird things, but it's been getting quite a lot better.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It looks like 2.96 fixes almost all of our bugs (except the really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weird ones like the misoptimization stuff), but it still segfaults a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lot :(
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  I've been keeping up with it as best as I can (binutils is getting
<BR>
pretty frenzied, though, so I've been trying to keep my mind on my own
<BR>
package as well :-P).  It's a very promising development cycle, from the
<BR>
looks of it.  Let's hope some late-minute commits don't screw some of that
<BR>
goodness up :-P
