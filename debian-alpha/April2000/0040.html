Dunno,
<BR>
But fixing ypserver is easy. Take it off line here and tell me what your
<BR>
ypserver problem is.
<BR>
I mean it doesn't sound like you are running a business on it.
<BR>
If ypserver on Debian is like all the other Linuxs out there /etc/passwd and
<BR>
/var/yp/make are easy to fix.

<EM>&gt; Sounds more like pilot error.

<P>Thanks, that's good to know... if only I knew what a pilot error is!

<P>My (Intel) NIS server lost a handful of files from /var during a reboot over

the

weekend...
<BR>
<P>Uh oh, tried to fix it remotely and got myself into a heap of trouble...
<BR>
The
<BR>
problem is pretty serious, I'll have to go in and fix it.
<BR>
<P>One question: why did my Intel clients still work in spite of this problem?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have a large NIS network <A HREF="http://www.testdrive.copaq.com.">http://www.testdrive.copaq.com.</A>

<EM>&gt; Grab a shell account and see for yourself that Debian works perfectly in
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; environment that you are discussing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, I believe you.
