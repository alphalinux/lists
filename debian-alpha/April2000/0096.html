</EM><BR>
<P>I believe it does ok with that, but I haven't even delved into that
<BR>
segment yet.  It may not, considering it can't even parse the BFD
<BR>
structure, from what I can tell....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Speaking of which, has anyone talked to them about the binary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incompatibility problems (RH's glibc not providing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; __register_frame_info and friends) we're facing?  It's really up to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them to fix it, but I haven't looked at RH6.2 yet so I don't know if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they really did or not...
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From what I can tell, they haven't made an effort yet.  Then again, I
</EM><BR>
believe we're ahead of them in glibc revisions.  Also, the only reason
<BR>
that we have the symbol and they don't is because they're still using
<BR>
egcs.  Doubt this will change any time soon.  I've actually talked about
<BR>
this on the axp-list, but I think RH doesn't bother reading it anymore.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Particularly since TurboLinux and Mandrake are releasing Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distributions and they will probably just be using exactly the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stuff as Red Hat :P
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe not.  They seem to like to stay more on the &quot;bleeding edge&quot; than RH
<BR>
does...so they may use the complex patch to make gcc compile glibc (like
<BR>
we do).
<BR>
<P>I'm very happy that we're really using gcc.  I never liked egcs much
<BR>
except for the fact that it actually worked on Alpha...
