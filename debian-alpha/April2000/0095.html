<P><EM>&gt; Unfortunately, the way our ldconfig works now is this way:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * it tries to read the SONAME info and almost does it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * it fails, unfortunately, so it uses it's last ditch effort...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * it assumes the SONAME = current lib name (which often isn't the case)
</EM><BR>
<P>So, really, this is the only thing that needs to be fixed?  There is
<BR>
also the management of /etc/ld.so.cache, which I presume would be
<BR>
working fine otherwise.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I never figured out if RH has a working version, but I'd suspect that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't...
</EM><BR>
<P>Speaking of which, has anyone talked to them about the binary
<BR>
incompatibility problems (RH's glibc not providing
<BR>
__register_frame_info and friends) we're facing?  It's really up to
<BR>
them to fix it, but I haven't looked at RH6.2 yet so I don't know if
<BR>
they really did or not...
<BR>
<P>Particularly since TurboLinux and Mandrake are releasing Alpha
<BR>
distributions and they will probably just be using exactly the same
<BR>
stuff as Red Hat :P
