<P>Hehehe...if that was meant to convey a lack of enthusiasm, then I feel

your pain :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've always wondered what the use of ldconfig was really ... if it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just to make soname links then it's fairly useless since we already do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that in our packaging.  In general it looks like some kind of vestige
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the old libc5 crud on i386 (which of course never existed on alpha).
</EM><BR>
<P>That's pretty much it, but it often has to do it prior to or after
<BR>
packaging (it's often run in postinst scripts, fyi).  Also, it kinda needs
<BR>
to be there for custom/hand-installed stuff on systems.
<BR>
<P>In the case of ncpfs, the binaries are linked against the name stored in
<BR>
SONAME, so when dh_shlibdeps tries to ldd the binaries, the dynamic linker
<BR>
dies because the lib it looks for (really, the symlink) doesn't exist.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, the way our ldconfig works now is this way:
<BR>
* it tries to read the SONAME info and almost does it
<BR>
* it fails, unfortunately, so it uses it's last ditch effort...
<BR>
* it assumes the SONAME = current lib name (which often isn't the case)
<BR>
<P>Honestly, I'm surprised that this hasn't come up before, but I guess
<BR>
Debian maintainers usually cover these bases with adding symlinks either
<BR>
by hand or using the packaging tools.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Interesting that ldconfig never got rewritten properly like the rest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of ld.so did.  I might have some time to look at it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, really, ld.so only got rewritten to support non-i386 stuff, not
<BR>
necessarily anything else.  Alpha only uses ldconfig from that package
<BR>
(the rest is unbuilt totally since it's unnecessary -- we've always used a
<BR>
glibc iteration, so we didn't need to deal with libc5 at all).  That's
<BR>
probably why it never got done.
<BR>
<P>I never figured out if RH has a working version, but I'd suspect that they
<BR>
don't...
