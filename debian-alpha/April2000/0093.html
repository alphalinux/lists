<P><EM>&gt; Over the past week, I've been attempting to find a version of ldconfig
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that actually works as advertised on Alpha.  Well, what I concluded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was...there isn't one.  The current implementation in the ld.so package
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; loves 32-bit ELF, but has no clue about 64-bit ELF.  This is what's been
</EM><BR>
<P>Wow, great.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; breaking the ncpfs package compilation all of this time (ldconfig can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; read the SONAME out of the library, so it doesn't set up links).  Doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ALOT of debugging on ldconfig shows that it's really not doing anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for us at all.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've always wondered what the use of ldconfig was really ... if it's
<BR>
just to make soname links then it's fairly useless since we already do
<BR>
that in our packaging.  In general it looks like some kind of vestige
<BR>
of the old libc5 crud on i386 (which of course never existed on alpha).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So, I started trying to patch it for 64-bit ELF support (or actually, more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generic ELF support), but it just isn't going well.  I'm lacking the time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to properly handle this one (even though I'm probably the best one to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; handle it, unfortunately).  I'm leaning towards a complete rewrite at this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stage, which would probably benefit the entire Linux community...
</EM><BR>
<P>Interesting that ldconfig never got rewritten properly like the rest
<BR>
of ld.so did.  I might have some time to look at it.
