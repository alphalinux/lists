<P>Thanks, that's good to know... if only I knew what a pilot error is!

<P>My (Intel) NIS server lost a handful of files from /var during a reboot over the

weekend...

<P>Uh oh, tried to fix it remotely and got myself into a heap of trouble...  The
<BR>
problem is pretty serious, I'll have to go in and fix it.
<BR>
<P>One question: why did my Intel clients still work in spite of this problem?

<EM>&gt; Grab a shell account and see for yourself that Debian works perfectly in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environment that you are discussing.

<P>Okay, I believe you.
