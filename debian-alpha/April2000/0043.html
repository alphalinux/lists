<P>
I'm so sorry, re-installing nis actually did the trick, now cd /var/yp;
<BR>
make is fine.
<BR>
<P>What I didn't know was that when I tried to remotely reboot yesterday,
<BR>
my /var partition was again corrupted (I think this is a kernel IDE
<BR>
issue, seems to happen every time...), so it didn't come up cleanly,
<BR>
which is why I thought I was in a heap of trouble.
<BR>
<P>So, problem solved.  Still doesn't explain why the Intel clients
<BR>
continued to work though... :-)
<BR>
<P>Thanks for all the help!
<BR>
