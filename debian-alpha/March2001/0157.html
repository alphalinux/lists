Hi Jakub,
<BR>
<P>I am a little bit confused about the differences between Debian
<BR>
install and AlphaLinux aboot install. According to AlphaLinux we have
<BR>
to use minlabel to partition the disk, and copy jensen17.img to the 1st 
<BR>
partition using copyboot. But I have observed from Debian install
<BR>
that it will try to create the aboot by itself (option: copy aboot to
<BR>
partition ??? ). I may be misunderstanding it. Using kernel from 
<BR>
jensen17.img (2.2.7), that is, Alphalinux kernel, I could install Debian but 
<BR>
then I realized that Debian kernel 2.2.18 does not work. I decided to start 
<BR>
it over and curiously I no longer can install Debian, even after reformating 
<BR>
the disk. That is, I no longer can initialize the base system. It could be 
<BR>
the fact that I am using now ECU NT version which is different than ECU 
<BR>
Linux version provided by AlphaLinux (as far as I know). I have also notice 
<BR>
that Debian install uses fdisk in BSD mode to create its own partition 
<BR>
scheme (option &quot;f&quot;) skipping the first cylinder of first partition (2-515) 
<BR>
which is quite different than the minlabel method.
<BR>
I would like to have a copy of your linux kernel file for the Debian
<BR>
install. I will provide to you a ftp access since file is big as you 
<BR>
mentioned.
<BR>
I'd also like to learn how you recompiled the kernel, did you use
<BR>
another similar Alpha machine running Debian?
<BR>
Did you delete jensen17-kernel(2.2.17) and copy your new kernel IMAGE 
<BR>
directly to aboot?
<BR>
Would you please describe a little bit your install method ?
<BR>
I have tried so many things so far, as you can see.
<BR>
I really appreciate your help.
<BR>
<P>Thanks
<BR>
Luiz
<BR>
<P>PS: I will send the ftp access to your e-mail. thanks again.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Dear Debian-Alpha-Jensen users:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I tried to use the following command to start the Debian-Jensen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; install:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;boot -fl i dka400
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; aboot1.7&gt; b 0/dists/potato/main/disks-alpha/current/jensen/linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; root=/dev/fd0 load_ramdisk=1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; but the file &quot;linux&quot; is broken.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Does anyone know where I can find a &quot;linux&quot; file which works with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Debian-Jensen?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; TIA,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   Luiz
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It's me again.  I hope you won't add me to rbl for stupid answers :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I was dealing with same problem, and noone could help me. I think you saw
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;kernel booting and then stopped after Kswapd. That's known bug. The answer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is to change the kernel to the one you have compiled by yourself, write it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to disk and boot.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If you have no acces to the working kernel i can send it to you but it's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;3mb
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;JA
