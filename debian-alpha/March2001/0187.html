<P><EM>&gt; IIRC, the only problem was with the create-comp-config.sh in the ccc-rpm, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sets up the compiler. cpml will be handled by adam's installer and libots seems failry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; straight-forward.
</EM><BR>
<P>libots already has a .deb which you can get with the 1.0 FORTRAN compiler .debs.  But I do some
<BR>
shlibs magic with cpml and cxml (I use the soname libcpml.so.0 and put an extra symlink from
<BR>
/usr/lib/libcpml.so.0 to the shared lib, then put &quot;libcpml 0 cpml&quot; in shlibs, same with cxml), so
<BR>
packages built against them will automatically depend on them through the shlibdeps mechanism.
<BR>
(Isn't Debian amazing? :-)
<BR>
<P>I think this is a good enough reason to do a libots installer too, so I'll go ahead and do that and
<BR>
upload today with the other two.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'll modify create-comp-config.sh to work on debian systems and supply a patch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the original, once it's done, so ppl will have to re-run the patched version, once the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rpm itself is installed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Still being a complete idiot wrt debian packages, i assume a debian-installer similar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the one adam provided for cpml, will be able to patch the create-comp-config.sh
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; script and run the result along with the ususal &quot;debian-magic&quot; required ;-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup.  Not much magic there.  Except it's more convenient for postinst to use sed than a patch, so
<BR>
I'll convert your patch to do it that way.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think, i'll do it over the coming weekend, since i do have some work today ( btw: trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; convince a customer to buy a fairly large debian-alpha based setup for commercial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; server usage - very exciting after my years of SPARC/Solaris stuff - hopefully compaq
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supports my effort ;-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Great!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Anyway, two questions remain:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1. is this patch-approach acceptable for The Debian Way (TM) ?
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course. :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2. will compaq sue the crap out of me, if i distribute a patch ?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm pretty sure they won't.  The libots/cpml/cxml &quot;license&quot; doesn't even restrict redistribution of
<BR>
the libraries (if it did, people would not be able to distribute statically-linked binaries, so
<BR>
there would be no point in including the static libs).  We're just not doing that because they
<BR>
don't like others to distribute them and we want to be good netizens and make them happy.
<BR>
<P>The create-comp-config.sh script is a trivial little thing in plain text for all to see, so I'm
<BR>
pretty certain they won't object to patching it, though it would be good to get a second opinion
<BR>
from someone with more authority...  And I need to know this too, since I'll have to distribute
<BR>
such a patch or sed with the installer!  Now if we were making binary patches to their libs, they
<BR>
might object to that. :-)
<BR>
<P>The other issue is forward compatibility with create-comp-config.sh in future ccc packages.  The
<BR>
installer package tells the user it's only guaranteed to work on the specific RPM filename/version
<BR>
given, but (s)he is welcome to try it with newer versions if necessary.  I hope create-comp-config
<BR>
doesn't change much, so this forward compatibility will remain; in any case, a sed script is more
<BR>
likely to keep working than a patch because it just looks for and replaces specific words instead
<BR>
of entire lines.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for helping to make this happen!
