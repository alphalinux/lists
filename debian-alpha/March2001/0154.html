<P>
[sorry for the wide CC; please note the Reply-To header]
<BR>
<P>Predictably, my efforts to create a synchonization point for XFree86 blew
<BR>
up in my face.
<BR>
<P>So, alpha, arm, and m68k, *stop the presses*.  You can build this version,
<BR>
but it's going to be a little buggy, and it will not be the last one you
<BR>
have to build for a while.  There will be a 4.0.2-13.
<BR>
<P>1) 4.0.2-12 for i386 is broken.  Just building against libc6 2.2.2-2 is
<BR>
insufficient to avoid the gcc/binutils problem that BenC warned about in
<BR>
debian-devel.
<BR>
<P>So, the X library packages on i386 can't be compiled against until further
<BR>
notice.
<BR>
<P>2) There is a problem with app-defaults migration.  Packages that ship
<BR>
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults, *but no longer exist* create a file
<BR>
overlap.  So far I know of only one package fitting that description: xmh
<BR>
(part of XFree86 3.3.6).
<BR>
<P>There are a few ways to solve this problem:
<BR>
<P>1) xlibs can Replaces: every such package
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with this approach is that I don't yet know the entire list
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of packages with the same problem as xmh.  Some scriptage involving the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;potato and sid Contents and Packages files would probably help, but if
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more app-defaults using packages from potato vanish before woody is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;released, the problem comes back.  Keeping up with this moving target is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not an appetizing prospect to me.
<BR>
<P>2) xlibs can stop shipping /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults (which is a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;symlink) and just create it in its postinst, and remove it in its prerm,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just as we do with /usr/doc -&gt; /usr/share/doc
<BR>
<P>3) We can do either of the above, but move the solution to the xlib6g
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;package.  Potato X clients are guaranteed to depend on xlib6g, so this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;package will get upgraded.  Also, xlib6g will go away in the woody+1
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;release of Debian, as will the need for this compatibility symlink.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Actually, in theory since all still-living packages that use
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;app-defaults have now made the transition to /etc/X11, I can get rid of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the symlink right now.  But I want to keep it around so that things
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;don't get screwed up in odd situtations, e.g., a person downgrades to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the woody version of a package, or a maintainer whose app-defaults using
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;package was NMU'ed to effect the transition reawakens from death and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;does a maintainer upload which backs out some/all of the NMU bug fixes,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;since he was not properly coddled and stroked by the person doing the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NMU [see debian-devel for a discussion of this subject].)
<BR>
<P>I'm tempted to go with solution 2) because it is the least effort.  Here's
<BR>
your chance to express your opinion on this subject.
