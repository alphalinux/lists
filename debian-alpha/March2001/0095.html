<P>
G'day people with 64 bit computers (perhaps),
<BR>
<P>I am the Debian maintainer for LPRng.  This package had a severe problem
<BR>
in version 3.7.4-1 where lpd would immediately die on startup.  A fix
<BR>
was kindly provided by an alpha user and I uploaded 3.7.4-2
<BR>
<P>But I've heard scattered reports of lpd crashing on alphas or sparcs.
<BR>
I'm not sure exactly what version they're running to know if this fix
<BR>
has fixed things or there is another nasty lurking there.
<BR>
<P>If you run LPRng and are using 3.7.4-2 then could you drop me a line and
<BR>
say &quot;yeah it's working&quot; and just a few words about the config. I don't
<BR>
need the printcap, just something like are the clients (where you print)
<BR>
are local or remote and are the printers connected to parallel port or
<BR>
networked printers.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for your help, and for the alpha people; yes I will get my
<BR>
PC164SX going one day.. blame aussie memory prices.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Craig
