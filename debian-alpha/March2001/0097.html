Hi all,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well thanks to Ryan Murray the build seems to be running now.  I'm
<BR>
shy one binary needed to properly process the logs but should have that
<BR>
by tomorrow... So I'd like to ask those building packages for Alpha to
<BR>
hold off and see how the buildd does things...
<BR>
<P>there are some packages that the buildd is failing on...and most likely
<BR>
it's failing for everyone so they will need manual work.  Ryan is also
<BR>
working on the web reports and all (for all buildd's actually) so we will 
<BR>
also be able to monitor this buildd's process and logs as well as any other
<BR>
alpha buildd's that crop up.  I believe Chris is also setting one up.  
<BR>
<P>If you want to help build packages, let me know and I can ship you a list
<BR>
(or at least dump to a web page) a list of current packages that fail to
<BR>
build.  
<BR>
<P>I'd like to also state that while the buildd pumps out packages there will
<BR>
be quite a bit that are still broken...like a big example is KDE...while the
<BR>
buildd successfully builds kde packages they still fail to run.  We need
<BR>
to start keeping track of which packages have this problem so we can 
<BR>
make sure they get rebuilt once gcc/g++ (or whatever may be causing the 
<BR>
particular problem) is fixed.  
<BR>
<P>I'm not sure the best way for this...maybe a bug report with a specific
<BR>
tag or something...
<BR>
<P>Ivan
