<EM>&gt; &gt; Just so I'm clear on this, you've tried 512MB DIMMS with no luck on SX?

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No pentium computer which worth a price of one 512MB memory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stick here sorry. I presumed that if it is possible it would hjave been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; known by now. Let's see, just to make it clear, can I infer that no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; single Compaq Alpha engineer ever took a couple of 512MB sticks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from colleague’s table and plugged them into SX or LX or other older
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha ???????? [beep] [beep] and [beep] I would say, engineers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of &quot;high-performance&quot; computers, sh*t ! Compaq managers are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; frequently bashed in this and other lists and for the reasons, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it have never crossed my mind before that Alpha engineers are so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; totally in a lack of imagination too.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's a little much....you make the assumption that these engineering
<BR>
have unlimited acess to more hardware than they know what to do with. Do
<BR>
you know what 512MB DIMMs cost today and more importantly what they would
<BR>
have cost when the SX was being developed? I can't speak for inside
<BR>
Compaq/DEC but I know I can't just find 512MB DIMMs lying around the
<BR>
office....even today. Do you think that memory companies just send us
<BR>
truck loads of memory for free?
<BR>
<P>I'm sure plenty of people thought of it....but there's a big difference
<BR>
between thinking about it, and finding the hardware to do it.
