<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; How about installing ntpdate and configuring /etc/init.d/ntpdate so that

<EM>&gt; necessary, as long it's at least in the right month :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>It's also convenient, if you have the correct time. Running 'make' to build larger
<BR>
binaries, that span several NFS mounts can be a hog, if 'make' gets confused on the
<BR>
timestamps of files on the various servers.
<BR>
Silly thing, but guess, how long it took me to....... ;-)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bring up the &quot;let's start an NTP server in-house&quot; idea to the sysadmin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; again this week... :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even better of course...  One master system behind the firewall that an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be reached by all local systems and that can reach out through the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; firewall to sync itself.
</EM><BR>
<P>Can't tell for the US, but I like my little external clock-device receiving the time signal, which
<BR>
is in Germany called DCF-77. I configured NTP to use that device on one system and
<BR>
synchronize the rest of the net to that system. The receiver device - connecting to a parallel port -
<BR>
is well supported in linux and only US-$ 29. Again, this is for germany only, but i assume,
<BR>
other countries have similar cheap offerings.
<BR>
I prefer this over synchronizing to 'external' ( read; internet ) timeservers, since the communication
<BR>
btw the timeserver and your local net can be hacked.
<BR>
<P>However, all of this wouldn't help Chris anyway. ntpd by default will not synchronize to an
<BR>
external clock-source, if the drift between local clock and remote clock suddenly jumps
<BR>
by a few years. ntpd will, in that case reject the external clock source as being valid.
<BR>
Of course, you can configure ntpd to trust the external source more that the system's own clock,
<BR>
but that *really* would open big hacking opportunities to hackers, if you synchronize to
<BR>
internet-space timeservers ;-)
<BR>
<P>Anyway, CONFIG_RTC=y prevented my Alphas from skipping dates, as stated before.
<BR>
If you run anything depending on file-times over network services. i strongly recommend
<BR>
using ntpd and a nifty hardware-clock.
<BR>
<P>Although, I found ntp to be a real STRANGE thing to configure........
<BR>
<P>Am i off-topic ? yes. But ir's late and all of my beer is empty ;-)
