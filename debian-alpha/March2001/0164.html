Hi Luiz
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Hi Jakub,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am a little bit confused about the differences between Debian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; install and AlphaLinux aboot install. According to AlphaLinux we have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to use minlabel to partition the disk, and copy jensen17.img to the 1st
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; partition using copyboot. But I have observed from Debian install
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that it will try to create the aboot by itself (option: copy aboot to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; partition ??? ). I may be misunderstanding it. Using kernel from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; jensen17.img (2.2.7), that is, Alphalinux kernel, I could install Debian
</EM><BR>
but
<BR>
<EM>&gt; then I realized that Debian kernel 2.2.18 does not work. I decided to
</EM><BR>
start
<BR>
<EM>&gt; it over and curiously I no longer can install Debian, even after
</EM><BR>
reformating
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the disk. That is, I no longer can initialize the base system. It could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the fact that I am using now ECU NT version which is different than ECU
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux version provided by AlphaLinux (as far as I know).
</EM><BR>
<P>If you will have troubles with getting aboot to work with srm you may want
<BR>
to load your ECU from OSF diskette
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have also notice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that Debian install uses fdisk in BSD mode to create its own partition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scheme (option &quot;f&quot;) skipping the first cylinder of first partition (2-515)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which is quite different than the minlabel method.
</EM><BR>
<P>Just skip every debian &quot;suggestions&quot; about partitionning scheme.
<BR>
I used minlabel so that i have started partitions with 4096 offset. There
<BR>
you should fit aboot and kernel (in that case only aboot is important). Then
<BR>
create /boot partition about 14megs there you should copy vmlinux and
<BR>
root.bin from installation diskette. Then create If you have another box
<BR>
accesible jut compile it with bsd partitions support, gain access to your
<BR>
disk after you've partitioned it with minlabel and copy to /boot partition
<BR>
vmlinux and root.bin. Than you can start thinking of booting. I never
<BR>
(really NEVER) succeded with copyboot. Better solution is to use swriteboot
<BR>
from other box.
<BR>
In interactive boot you say: 1/vmlinux root=/dev/ram initrd=root.bin. 1 is
<BR>
your /boot partition
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I would like to have a copy of your linux kernel file for the Debian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; install. I will provide to you a ftp access since file is big as you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mentioned.
</EM><BR>
<P>After zipping it with root.bin and bootlx it has 2,8 mb
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'd also like to learn how you recompiled the kernel, did you use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; another similar Alpha machine running Debian?
</EM><BR>
<P>The true is i didn't. I got this kernel from other party with RedHat which
<BR>
they have installed.
<BR>
I have asked on few newsgroups how compile cross platform kernel, but there
<BR>
was no even echo from there. Maybe someone here?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Did you delete jensen17-kernel(2.2.17) and copy your new kernel IMAGE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; directly to aboot?
</EM><BR>
<P>You can have both kernels, as long as you have aboot on the same partition
<BR>
just choose interactive boot. As long as I remember kernel i sent to you is
<BR>
2.14 and it worked perfectly for install purposes. Normally i use 2.2.18
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Would you please describe a little bit your install method ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have tried so many things so far, as you can see.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I really appreciate your help.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Luiz
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; PS: I will send the ftp access to your e-mail. thanks again.
</EM><BR>
