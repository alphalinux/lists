Ok, 
<BR>
on the issue of getting the Compaq Compilers to work on debian, here's what i'm looking at.
<BR>
I have received emails about the scripts i have, that will install the compiler on debian.
<BR>
I got the impression, that this a a fairly urgent issue for some users.
<BR>
<P>Here is ( my version of a ) plan:
<BR>
<P>Curently, i'm downloading the latest incarnations of the compaq-toolchain, that is
<BR>
ccc, cpml and ladebug. I'll modify my stuff to work with these latest compilers.
<BR>
IIRC, the only problem was with the create-comp-config.sh in the ccc-rpm, which
<BR>
sets up the compiler. cpml will be handled by adam's installer and libots seems failry
<BR>
straight-forward.
<BR>
I'll modify create-comp-config.sh to work on debian systems and supply a patch
<BR>
to the original, once it's done, so ppl will have to re-run the patched version, once the
<BR>
rpm itself is installed.
<BR>
Still being a complete idiot wrt debian packages, i assume a debian-installer similar
<BR>
to the one adam provided for cpml, will be able to patch the create-comp-config.sh
<BR>
script and run the result along with the ususal &quot;debian-magic&quot; required ;-)
<BR>
<P>I think, i'll do it over the coming weekend, since i do have some work today ( btw: trying to
<BR>
convince a customer to buy a fairly large debian-alpha based setup for commercial
<BR>
server usage - very exciting after my years of SPARC/Solaris stuff - hopefully compaq
<BR>
supports my effort ;-)
<BR>
<P>Anyway, two questions remain:
<BR>
1. is this patch-approach acceptable for The Debian Way (TM) ?
<BR>
2. will compaq sue the crap out of me, if i distribute a patch ?
<BR>
<P>for the second question, i could use a pointer ( email-adress ) of some compaq official, to whom
<BR>
i could propose this. so, if anybody happens to know somebody who knows...... let me know.
<BR>
<P>Hope this helps.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
