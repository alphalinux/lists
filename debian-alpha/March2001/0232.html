Greetings,
<BR>
<P>I have made a ccc installer package like the ones for libots, cpml and
<BR>
cxml.  I just uploaded it, so it's in incoming, and you can also get it
<BR>
from <A HREF="http://lyre.mit.edu/~powell/compaq/">http://lyre.mit.edu/~powell/compaq/</A> .
<BR>
<P>The only hangup I can find is that the sml and rsml man pages go into
<BR>
/usr/man in the RPM, but Debian's man does not look there or in
<BR>
/usr/share/man so man sml or rsml turns up empty.  I can link them from
<BR>
another section, if someone would suggest one.  There seem to be
<BR>
references to /usr/man/sml.gz and /usr/man/rsml.gz in the ccc man page,
<BR>
so &quot;man ccc&quot; gives an error because they're missing.  But making the
<BR>
links from /usr/man gives a lintian error...
<BR>
<P>So I'm leaving it without those manpages for now.  Oh well.
<BR>
<P>Also, as I've mentioned before, it depends on gcc-2.95, so it won't
<BR>
install on a potato system.  This is so I can specify the gcc directory
<BR>
and dependency explicitly, and it won't break on gcc upgrade.  Oh well.
<BR>
<P>It installs without comp.config, then runs create-comp-config.sh to
<BR>
generate it, and it seems to generate just fine, so we don't need to
<BR>
patch comp.config.  It passes the &quot;hello world&quot; test, but I haven't
<BR>
pushed it beyond that yet.
<BR>
<P>Try it, push it hard, share and enjoy, etc.
<BR>
<P>Coming next week: cfalrtl and cfal, then test with PETSc, then on to cxx
<BR>
and ladebug...  Maybe someone else can do Q's Java stuff?  (BTW, can
<BR>
mozilla use Q's JVM?  Is it high-performance?  If no, not much
<BR>
motivation to build it.)
<BR>
<P>Zeen,
<BR>
<P>-Adam P.
