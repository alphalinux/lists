<P><EM>&gt; I'd be happy to provide any assistance, if desired. I have written some

<EM>&gt; scripts, that cleans up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the mess left behind, if the packages are installed on a Debian system using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the rpm-deb.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can complete them for the various packages involved - currently they only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cover
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the C-compiler, since that's the only one I use ;-)

<P>Great, it sounds like we have a good team.  I'm no Debian packaging expert, but
<BR>
have spent a fair amount of time studying the system.  For cpml and cxml, the
<BR>
&quot;cleanup&quot; is pretty simple: postinst merely creates and strips the shared lib,
<BR>
sets permissions appropriately, and puts the files where they should be in a
<BR>
Debian system.  Oh- and registers the MASSIVE cxml documentation with doc-base
<BR>
(though this doesn't work yet, and I've no idea why).
<BR>
<P>I'll try to add the /proc/cpuinfo | grep | cut trick for identifying system
<BR>
type.  I think it only needs to prohibit installation of the ev6 packages on
<BR>
pre-ev6 machines, because the ev5 libs will work on ev6 machines, right?  (In
<BR>
case someone wants to install a uniform package list on a heterogeneous cluster
<BR>
or something...)  I'll issue a warning for ev5 package installation on an ev6.
<BR>
<P>One important note: these packages start with just the files, meaning no scripts
<BR>
are run from the RPM at all.  (Are RPM &quot;postinst&quot; scripts included in alienized
<BR>
.debs?  If so, I'll have to figure out a way to get at them.)
<BR>
<P>That said, I know the ccc installer should run create-comp-config.sh (or perhaps
<BR>
create its own comp.config), adding the correct libgcc.a directory, and make the
<BR>
symlinks right.  Anything else important?  The current location of libgcc.a is
<BR>
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/alpha-linux/2.95.3/ with gcc-2.95 installed, so the installer
<BR>
will depend on gcc-2.95 for this.  If the location changes, there will have to
<BR>
be a new version of the installer package...  Oh- and I'll have to figure out
<BR>
how to do the ccc man pages right.
<BR>
<P>Okay.  Chris and Thomas (and others), could you glance over the cpml and cxml
<BR>
packages for correctness?  I'll make a couple of changes to those two packages
<BR>
(like CPU dependence) and put up -2 at some point today or tomorrow, then get to
<BR>
work on ccc, cfal, cfalrtl, cxx and ladebug in approximately that order.
<BR>
<P>I do have one question for the Debian packaging experts.  I specified the
<BR>
section for cpml-ev5 as contrib/libs in the control file, and dpkg -I on the
<BR>
binary package shows it there too.  But when installed, dpkg -s and dselect list
<BR>
cpml-ev5 under section compaq, along with the libots .deb (which should be in
<BR>
compaq), and cxml-ev5 is in contrib/libs as it should be.  Anyone with any ideas
<BR>
on why?
<BR>
<P>Thanks very much,
<BR>
