<P>
This is going to sound dumb, but you only learn by asking...
<BR>
<P>I'd like to get CCC and the CPML up and running on my fairly bare bones Alpha (Ruffian with Stable, and not much else).
<BR>
<P>I have found RPMS on Compaq's site. But I don't know what to do with them. The thread that just went past (Java) mentioned &quot;alien&quot;, and I assume from the one line description that this will create a .deb from a .rpm. I've never even dealt with a raw .deb file yet (I am like a trained chicken, I can select things in deselect, and peck the return key occasionally!) so I don't even know what to do with the .debs after I created them!
<BR>
I did a quick search for alien on  www.debian.org, and the only hits which looked vaguely relevant (_really vaguely_), were dead links. 
<BR>
<P>I'm not at my machine now, but I'd like to know in advance where I should look when I get home (hasty - and I have a printer here at work for any docs I may want to refer to at length). Is there a RPM howto or suchlike? Or when I grab alien will the man page tell me everything I need to know? If I have alien do I need anything else to get CCC up and running?
<BR>
<P>Cheers for your time
