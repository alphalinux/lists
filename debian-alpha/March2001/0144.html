<P>
[My apologies for the obscenely broad crosspost, but I think you'll
<BR>
understand the reason why.]
<BR>
<P>XFree86 4.0.2-12 for i386 has been uploaded to auric's incoming.  (Yes, I
<BR>
built it against libc6 2.2.2-2, not 2.2.2-3 or later.)
<BR>
<P>It is my intention for this to be my last release in the 4.0.2 series.
<BR>
<P>XFree86 4.0.3 is out and I need to devote my full attention to getting it
<BR>
packaged.  However, migrating patches from one upstream release to the next
<BR>
is always a pain, so I'd like 4.0.2-12 to serve as a release that we get
<BR>
into testing no matter what, because the road might be a little rough for
<BR>
the first few Debian versions of 4.0.3.
<BR>
<P>To do that, we need some architecture synchronization.  So here's my status
<BR>
report on the XFree86 architecture front.  Each arch is followed by my
<BR>
notes on the current buildability on each architecture (what I know if it,
<BR>
at least).  I also note if I've added patches for support of an
<BR>
architecture since the last successful build that appears in auric's pools.
<BR>
<P>ARCH		STATUS
<BR>
<P>alpha		build needed, 4.0.2-11 is current
<BR>
arm		build needed, 4.0.2-11 is current (-12 contains patches)
<BR>
hurd-i386	build needed, 4.0.2-4 is current (-12 contain patches)
<BR>
ia64 		build needed, no current version (-11 contains patches)
<BR>
i386		built and uploaded
<BR>
m68k		build needed, 4.0.2-7 is current
<BR>
mips		build needed, 4.0.2-11 is current
<BR>
powerpc		no build needed, I'm taking care of it
<BR>
s390		build needed, no current version (-6 contains patches)
<BR>
sparc		no build needed, I'm taking care of it
<BR>
<P>I realize that the ia64 and s390 arches probably aren't really in auric's
<BR>
pool mechanism yet.  This just serves as a notice that new versions exist,
<BR>
and I haven't heard anything back with respect to success or failure on
<BR>
these architectures since I integrated the fixes that were sent to me.
<BR>
<P>In short: alpha, arm, and m68k, please build 4.0.2-12.  That will be
<BR>
sufficient to get 4.0.2-12 into testing.
<BR>
