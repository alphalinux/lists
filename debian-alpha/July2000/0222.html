Hi all...
<BR>
<P>After realising that apt-cache does exactly what I wanted to do WRT
<BR>
scanning bad dependencies (my bad...should've caught this before), I
<BR>
generated a not-so-short list of bad dependencies and suggests.  Many are
<BR>
non-US, and thus I'm unable to correct them (since I'm not in the free
<BR>
world), but the ones that are in the regular archive, I'm going to
<BR>
investigate.  I've pruned the very obvious already (anything java-related
<BR>
or related to netscape and kernel images).  If someone else wants to take
<BR>
a few of these, let me know or else I'll be plugging away at them over the
<BR>
next few days.  Also, if they're simply hard-coded dependencies that are
<BR>
bogus, please feel free to file a bug and binary-NMU the packages...
<BR>
<P>Thanks!
<BR>
