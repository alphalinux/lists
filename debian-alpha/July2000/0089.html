<P>The new mount didn't help...still showing handled exceptions all over the
<BR>
place when mounting, but it looks like they're just warnings (probably
<BR>
still there to debug but will be removed eventually).  The new kernel
<BR>
looks pretty nice, though.  It still doesn't agree with mysqld so far, but
<BR>
that looks like a patchable issue with the kernel's sched code and appears
<BR>
to be related to some of the stuff that I posted the patch for earlier.  I
<BR>
also saw a patch on the kernel list today that may fix things anyway
<BR>
(gotta re-review it before saying that for sure).
