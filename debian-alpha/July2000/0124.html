<P>
As the topic says I have an AlphaServer 1000A and am trying to install 
<BR>
Debian on it. A few seconds and screen flickers after it starts booting
<BR>
the kernel from the rescue image I get kicked back to SRM with the error:
<BR>
<P>halt code = 6
<BR>
double error halt
<BR>
PC = fffffc000031b24c
<BR>
<P>I've tried Debian 2.1 and 2.2 and a few other distributions just to be
<BR>
thorough and they all do the same thing. I am new to the Alpha
<BR>
architecture so this maybe not be a Linux specific issue but since the
<BR>
box is currently running Tru64 and had NT on it at one point so I don't
<BR>
think it's a hardware problem. I have updated the SRM firmware to 5.7 and
<BR>
ARC is 4.59 which had no effect.
<BR>
<P>Basically the hardware in the box is a Mylex DAC960(all the drives on on
<BR>
this RAID controller), QLogic ISP10x0(cdrom is on here), DE500-BA NIC, S3
<BR>
Trio64/Trio32 PCI Video(on-board LISA video is disabled), 128M memory.
<BR>
<P>Any help you could give me would be great, if you need anymore
<BR>
information let me know, just please specify where to find it =)
<BR>
<P>Thanks
