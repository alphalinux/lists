<P>
<EM>&gt; On Jul 17, Alan P. Kennedy, Sr scratched in indelible ink :
</EM><BR>
<P>&lt;snip error messages&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Looking at this matter I have never used an IDE drive with cdparanoia
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and suspect that may be the problem. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I tried a scsi cdrom drive and it is working now. I wonder if I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to compile the scsi emulation into the ide driver?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now I have to give cdrecord a try next.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
I had a similar problem with an old 4x SCSI drive.  My presumption was that it
<BR>
did not do digital audio extraction.  I have another 12x which works quite
<BR>
happily.  I have successfully used IDE drives on x86 machines with cdparanoi
<BR>
and cdda2wav so it's (probably) not that.
<BR>
Good to hear that it's working though.
