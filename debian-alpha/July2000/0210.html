<EM>&gt; I've played around with the SBLive cards, they work fairly well (with Alsa
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is) but make sure they are on PCI bus number 1. They produced a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; horrible noise on PCI bus 2 (though we've since sent a UP2000 to Alsa to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get them to fix it). We've also tested the SB16 PCI and Ensoniq AudioPCI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and they seem to work well.
</EM><BR>
The SBLive also works with the creative open source driver (the one
<BR>
in the kernel, and the one from opensource.creative.com). There
<BR>
are a few people with alpha's on their list (me included).
<BR>
<P>I didn't notice any problems with where the card was (this was a
<BR>
ruffian board, and the card was in a 32bit slot)
<BR>
<P>L.
