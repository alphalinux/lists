<P><EM> C&gt; Yes. Looks like you're missing a few packages there (including
</EM><BR>
<EM> C&gt; libesd0, libmikmod0, etc). Try an 'apt-get update ; apt-get -u
</EM><BR>
<EM> C&gt; upgrade' and see if it says that it's going to install some
</EM><BR>
<EM> C&gt; packages. If so, let it :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>I saw the followup post. I see that those packages are not needed.
<BR>
<P><EM> C&gt; BTW, I'm assuming this is potato...correct?
</EM><BR>
<P>Potato
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;&gt; I had another small problem. ppp would not work with older version
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; of linux ppp. If it is important I could dig out the error
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; messages, but don't have them on hand right now. I had to upgrade
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; to ppp-2.4.0b2.tar.gz in order to get ppp to work. What was
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; interesting is that ppp worked fine with my isp. Found the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; solution in the Linux usenet newsgroups. For the record this was
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; in the i386 distribution also.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM> C&gt; Hmmm...what kernel version are you running? I know there was some
</EM><BR>
<EM> C&gt; problems with some versions (can't recall exactly which, but I can
</EM><BR>
<EM> C&gt; search if needed).
</EM><BR>
<P>2.2.16 but it did not matter what kernel I had running pppd would not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work with the very old redhat based pppd at work, until I upgraded
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the base pppd package. This was strange because pppd worked with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everything else. I guess they need to upgrade at work but this out
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of my control.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for the info.
