<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; As a non-Alpha user (but an aspirant one), I'm curious to know how the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 'community' sees IA64? Is it perceived as a threat? Would alpha users
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be persuaded to switch over easily?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I, for one, am excited about having a 64-bit Intel chip out there for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lot of reasons.  For one, it'll make porting much easier since most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software authors will know the issues involved (rather than assume that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the whole world is 32-bit, like they do now) and write things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; properly.  Also, I think the competition may be good for Alpha since it'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bring more attention to the 64-bit market.  Right now, clock speed seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be what people look at rather than performance and I really hope that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changes (in my experience, a similarly-clocked Alpha can easily outperform
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Intel's current offerings in almost every area).
</EM><BR>
<P>As you say it's good to have more 64-bit awareness, but I'm wondering how
<BR>
long it will take the IA64 to reach &quot;the masses&quot;, ie how long will it
<BR>
remain a high-end architecture. It will probably remain expensive for at
<BR>
least a year or two (but we'll see what AMD does too), and since it
<BR>
emulates IA32 it won't be competitive with existing IA32 solutions.
<BR>
<P>Personally I'ld like to get hold of a 64-bit machine for operating systems
<BR>
research, but it's really a significant expense (for a poor student) and
<BR>
I'ld probably have to first earn the money, making the decision even more
<BR>
painful. (You can buy a lot of other stuff, eg lots of IA32 boxes, or an
<BR>
overseas holiday for the price of a 21264!). 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; On the downside, however, Intel's clout and manufacturing volume could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spell trouble for Alpha.  Since we don't really know what the pricepoint
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the Intels will be, it's hard to tell what effect their introduction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will have on the Alpha market, but one thing's for sure: Intel's bound to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; try to undercut the Alpha prices.  It's going to be interesting.  I'm also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; curious to see how well FP performance is compared to Alphas (haven't seen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a side-by-side comparison yet).  Alpha still may reign in the scientific
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market in the long run if the FP performance is still higher than Intel's.
</EM><BR>
<P>Who fabs the Alpha processors?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; How do the free software compiler-writer people feel about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; architecture?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree with the other statements made about gcc's support for IA64 (at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; least for now).  It's certainly going to be a bit before gcc optimises
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well for IA64, especially since it's just recently gotten better (albeit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still not great) for 64-bit processors in general.  The unique pipelining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the IA64 architecture makes this even uglier, though, so I'm very glad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to not have gotten involved in that port yet :-P
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From what I've read I understand that there is a lot of work to be done by
</EM><BR>
the compiler to benefit from IA64's features. It also seems very different
<BR>
from what we're used to.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; SGI's compilers are much better, as previously stated, mostly because of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SGI's experience with 64-bit issues (WRT to MIPS) and they've actually got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some really good people in their compiler area.  I just doubt that their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compiler will be more prominent (or take over) gcc's slot as the premiere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux compiler any time soon.  I'm hoping they donate more to gcc to make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it better since SGI doesn't turn much business from selling/supporting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compilers, even on their own machines.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I could go on and on about this, but I won't in the interest of brevity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>:-). Interesting how the GNU project was centered around GCC, and of
<BR>
course GCC is very portable, but yet it's very difficult when you start
<BR>
using radically different architectures. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; At any rate, IA64 is coming and, yes, I wouldn't mind having one, but what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it does to Alpha remains to be seen, I guess.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well Alpha has had a decent head start, we'll see what happens.
