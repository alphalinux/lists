<EM>&gt; In Germany, They do not have Problems to lend (a little bit older) kick

<EM>&gt; I got a Alphaserver 1200 this way. (have to give it back now, since I

<P>Ah, very encouraging.  I'll have to do that.  I've got some contacts in
<BR>
Compaq, but haven't talked to them in awhile.  Last time I asked, they
<BR>
were more involved in the whole DEC-&gt;Compaq changeover than anything else
<BR>
(back then, they weren't sure where Alpha would fit in with Compaq's
<BR>
strategy).  I'll have to re-open communication with them.  My SX is
<BR>
starting to really show it's limits now that the distributions are growing
<BR>
in size.  Hell, just a few weeks ago, glibc, gcc, and X all had new
<BR>
versions to compile and it took nearly all day just to do those.  It'd be
<BR>
nice to have a machine that would handle that in less time if possible
<BR>
(not to mention that I have under 9G of drive space and can't even
<BR>
maintain a mirror, so I have to scp everything I compile).
