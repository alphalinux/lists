<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I need to divide between Bus 0 and Bus 1, since the SRM firmware
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; gets screwed if it finds multiple VGA-Bioses on Bus 0. It seems it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't try to x86-emulate Boards in Bus 1.
</EM><BR>
<P>Correct.
<BR>
<P>Another way is to find cards with a VGA-disable switch; this allows
<BR>
them to be put on bus 0 and not have the BIOS run. Cards that fit this
<BR>
criterion are the Millennium I's and ELSA Synergys (Permedia 2) that
<BR>
we (COMPAQ) have sold in the past. Apparently, most commercial versions
<BR>
(as opposed to our OEM versions) do NOT have this switch.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Also, for exactly *that* scenario, XFree uses it's libint10.a, to initialize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cards that have previously not been initialized by POST procedures.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I assume, this fixes Alpha conflicts as well.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, it does, I believe.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However, one question still remains. Has anyone gotten XFree 4.0 running
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; multihead+xinerama on Alpha's ?
</EM><BR>
<P>Multihead, yes (using the above-mentioned Millennium I); I have no idea
<BR>
about the xinerama stuff, but expect it should work, as much of that was
<BR>
developed here (DEC).
<BR>
<P>One other observation: the XFree86 4.0 code is NOT clean WRT handling
<BR>
cards on multiple primary PCI buses, though it can detect them (as
<BR>
mentioned in previous postings). The problem area is not the
<BR>
memory-mapped registers or framebuffers on other than bus 0, but the
<BR>
use of explicit &quot;legacy&quot; VGA addresses in the code, which will be
<BR>
forced to bus 0 and NOT the correct bus. We are working on patches for
<BR>
this situation, and have had some success - one system with an AGP bus
<BR>
plus 3 PCI buses has had an adapter on each. However, the patches are
<BR>
not ready for prime time just yet, and do depend on additional kernel
<BR>
patches to work.
