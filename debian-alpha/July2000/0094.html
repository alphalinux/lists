<P><EM>&gt; Since both dark and I have been absent for the last week or so the number
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of RC bugs has ballooned outrageously, and some of your uploads and such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have been left sitting in incoming, and as such the release hasn't gotten
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; significantly closer. Sorry about that. :(
</EM><BR>
<P>No prob.  Some of the alpha fixes are in incoming, from my
<BR>
understanding.  I'm pretty sure that we're ready to write off the rest.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In any event, we'll hopefully get incoming cleared out shortly, and have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; i386 done in a day or two. Hopefully.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hehehehe...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; At this point, as far as i386 is concerned I expect most problems will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be ignored, save for maybe a couple of removals, a couple of upgrades,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and a handful of security fixes which will probably still be being added
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at a fairly late stage.
</EM><BR>
<P>The only removals that we've pretty much decided for alpha-wise are
<BR>
gnomeicu and lilypond (gnomeicu doesn't run correctly and lilypond has
<BR>
ancient dependencies and the new version won't compile for alpha now).
<BR>
I'll double check on others.  If gnucash isn't patched also, it should be
<BR>
removed due to an inability to read it's own files.  I've provided
<BR>
limited-scope patch for it, but the new version supercedes the patch and
<BR>
adds some other fixes as well; it's probably too late to put the new
<BR>
version into potato at this stage.
<BR>
<P>I welcome other posts as to what else is not working on Alpha.  I've only
<BR>
tested a few packages lately, so I'm not too sure of the list anymore
<BR>
(too much kernel hacking clutters my brain).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; On an only marginally related matter, I'd appreciate it if y'all could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get woody autobuilders happening fairly promptly and effectively by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the time potato releases. If there are hardware or bandwidth problems,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it'd be nice to resolve these ASAP, rather than JIT...
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe our autobuilder is chugging along nicely (with some delays since
<BR>
it's hand-started).  At any rate, once potato is released, I'll be doing
<BR>
my usual compilation-fests, so no worries with us.
<BR>
<P>If you happen to have some spare SCSI disks around so I can establish a
<BR>
mirror, though...scp'ing can get old at times :-)
