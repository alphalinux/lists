<P>Hmmm...is it possible that the disc in question is a rewritable?  I've run

into problems similar to this in the past with older CD-ROMs reading

rewritable disks (older lasers can't read them).

<P>Hmmm...I'll have to look at the kernel diffs a bit between 2.2.15 and
<BR>
2.2.16 (which I use) since this error didn't pop up for me.  I know there
<BR>
were some problems in the 2.4.0-test kernels WRT reading from CD-ROMs and
<BR>
DVDs that may have been present in some of the 2.2.x kernels too (again,
<BR>
need to verify this...just a guess for now).  Very odd.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now the interesting thing even with all the errors &quot;dd&quot; worked fine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and when I compared all the images produced with &quot;cmp&quot; all the images
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were identical. The scsi iso images were identical to the eide cdrom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; images. I guess these errors really don't mean much. To be very frank
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't have a clue what these errors mean. Interesting enough even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with a different cdrom disk (that is known good) I get the exact same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; errors. Note this is the same eide drive that would not work with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cdparanoia. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, I recognised the model right off as being a problematic drive that
<BR>
I've run into in the past.  The weird thing is, while diagnosing this, I
<BR>
realised that my old CD-ROM no longer worked, so I had to switch it with a
<BR>
newer one that I had laying around :-P
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So I guess one should make sure that the cdrom disk is good in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first place. Especially before posting. :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>No worries :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So why did the i386 machine read the bad cdrom disk correctly? I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suspect the reason is the i386 machine has a brand new scsi cdrom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reader/writer that was able to read the damaged disk. That is of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; course a guess. If I have some time I may change cdrom drives and see.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, newer CD-ROMs, in my understanding, have changed their laser
<BR>
colour/type to enable them to read other types of discs (namely
<BR>
rewritables burned in ISO9660 format), but older ones cannot.  If it was a
<BR>
factory-burned disc, however, it shouldn't have had any problems at
<BR>
all.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Does anyone know what these hda cdrom errors mean?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll look into it.  Looks like it *might* have been trying to seek beyond
<BR>
the end of the disc.  This was the problem, in my understanding, in the
<BR>
2.4.0-test kernels until recently, so maybe it manifested itself earlier
<BR>
as well.
