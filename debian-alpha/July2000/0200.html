<P><EM>&gt; As a non-Alpha user (but an aspirant one), I'm curious to know how the

<EM>&gt; 'community' sees IA64? Is it perceived as a threat? Would alpha users
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be persuaded to switch over easily?
</EM><BR>
<P>I, for one, am excited about having a 64-bit Intel chip out there for a
<BR>
lot of reasons.  For one, it'll make porting much easier since most
<BR>
software authors will know the issues involved (rather than assume that
<BR>
the whole world is 32-bit, like they do now) and write things
<BR>
properly.  Also, I think the competition may be good for Alpha since it'll
<BR>
bring more attention to the 64-bit market.  Right now, clock speed seems
<BR>
to be what people look at rather than performance and I really hope that
<BR>
changes (in my experience, a similarly-clocked Alpha can easily outperform
<BR>
Intel's current offerings in almost every area).
<BR>
<P>On the downside, however, Intel's clout and manufacturing volume could
<BR>
spell trouble for Alpha.  Since we don't really know what the pricepoint
<BR>
on the Intels will be, it's hard to tell what effect their introduction
<BR>
will have on the Alpha market, but one thing's for sure: Intel's bound to
<BR>
try to undercut the Alpha prices.  It's going to be interesting.  I'm also
<BR>
curious to see how well FP performance is compared to Alphas (haven't seen
<BR>
a side-by-side comparison yet).  Alpha still may reign in the scientific
<BR>
market in the long run if the FP performance is still higher than Intel's.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How do the free software compiler-writer people feel about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; architecture?
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with the other statements made about gcc's support for IA64 (at
<BR>
least for now).  It's certainly going to be a bit before gcc optimises
<BR>
well for IA64, especially since it's just recently gotten better (albeit
<BR>
still not great) for 64-bit processors in general.  The unique pipelining
<BR>
of the IA64 architecture makes this even uglier, though, so I'm very glad
<BR>
to not have gotten involved in that port yet :-P
<BR>
<P>SGI's compilers are much better, as previously stated, mostly because of
<BR>
SGI's experience with 64-bit issues (WRT to MIPS) and they've actually got
<BR>
some really good people in their compiler area.  I just doubt that their
<BR>
compiler will be more prominent (or take over) gcc's slot as the premiere
<BR>
Linux compiler any time soon.  I'm hoping they donate more to gcc to make
<BR>
it better since SGI doesn't turn much business from selling/supporting
<BR>
compilers, even on their own machines.
<BR>
<P>I could go on and on about this, but I won't in the interest of brevity
<BR>
:-)
<BR>
<P>At any rate, IA64 is coming and, yes, I wouldn't mind having one, but what
<BR>
it does to Alpha remains to be seen, I guess.
