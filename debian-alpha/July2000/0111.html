Hi all,
<BR>
<P>I am somewhat stuck - maybe somebody has solved this problem already ;-)
<BR>
<P>I run a dual-cpu UP2000 with Debian-potato. I compiled XFree86 4.0.1 in
<BR>
order to make use of a multihead/xinerama configuration. I intend to
<BR>
use a Voodoo 3 2000 PCI on PCI-Bus 0 and two Matrox G200 on Bus 1.
<BR>
I need to divide between Bus 0 and Bus 1, since the SRM firmware
<BR>
gets screwed if it finds multiple VGA-Bioses on Bus 0. It seems it
<BR>
doesn't try to x86-emulate Boards in Bus 1.
<BR>
I ran into a Xfree-Bug due to libscanpci probing Bus 2 ( a non-existent
<BR>
third bus ), triggering a kernel-Oops via pciconfig_read. Fixed that
<BR>
by limiting the max number of PCI-Buses to two in the Xfree sources.
<BR>
Now X -scanpci finds all cards OK, thus giving PCI:0:7:0 to the Voodoo
<BR>
and PCI:1:8:0 and 1:9:0 to the Matrox cards.
<BR>
<P>I used an ( OK ) XF86Config running perfectly on a x86 machine with the
<BR>
same cards in multihead+xinerama mode.
<BR>
<P>Now on the Alpha, the Xserver starts, but freezes somewhere, when it tries
<BR>
to probe the DDC channels for monitors on the Matrox cards ( as of the 
<BR>
XFree Logfile ).
<BR>
<P>Hum. I spend two days on this. Although I could use the x86 machine as an
<BR>
Xterminal to the Alpha ( current setup ), I would like to move _completely_
<BR>
to the Alpha.
<BR>
<P>Has anybody have a working multihead config running on Alpha ?
<BR>
How ? which machine ? which gfx-boards ? Any special hacks involved ?
<BR>
<P>Obviously, I would appreciate any help...
<BR>
<P><PRE>
