Hi all,
<BR>
I have installed debian-potato on my alpha using disks-alpha version
<BR>
2.2.15-2000-06-07. The system uses two SCSI-HDD on a build-in Adaptec
<BR>
and a third on an external symbios-logic controller.
<BR>
I partitoned the first drive ( the one to boot from ) leaving enough
<BR>
room for swriteboot to write the SRM bootloader ( yes, the machine is SRM ).
<BR>
The other two drives were partitioned using *all* of their space for
<BR>
data partitiones.
<BR>
After the initial base-install finished, the reboot unveiled, that drives
<BR>
two and three did not have any vaild disklabels on them. I confirmed this
<BR>
( believing in my own stupidity ;-) by repeating the base install process.
<BR>
<P>For the third try, I also left the first cylinder unused on drive 2 and 3,
<BR>
and now everything went OK. the drives were perfectly mounted upon
<BR>
reboot.
<BR>
<P>This makes me believe, that the install-routines swriteboots *all* drives.
<BR>
Here are my questions:
<BR>
<P>1. is my assumption correct ?
<BR>
2. is this intentional ?
<BR>
3. Is it known/fixed ?
<BR>
4. Is all this new to everybody and I should go ahead and fix it ( if no
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one volunteers, I should be able to do it - but I ask first ;-)
<BR>
<P><P>Sincerely
<BR>
Thomas Weyergraf
