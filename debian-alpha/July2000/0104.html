<P><EM> &gt;&gt; Hi,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; I was reading some docs on the WindowMaker tarball, and found
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; this:
</EM><BR>
<P>The windowmaker that comes with potato runs fine under alpha. I have
<BR>
one machine with windowmaker and so far no problems.
<BR>
<P><P><EM> Anton&gt; Disclaimer: alphas under my command have never run X and are
</EM><BR>
<EM> Anton&gt; least likely to suddenly start running it anytime soon.
</EM><BR>
<P>I run X without any problems, and the only app that does not work that
<BR>
I have tried is cdparanoia. 
<BR>
<P><P><EM> Anton&gt; 	Check where is yours at the moment and raise it to a more
</EM><BR>
<EM> Anton&gt; appropriate value by either catting to the appropriate /proc
</EM><BR>
<EM> Anton&gt; entry or changing the /usr/src/linux/include/asm/shmparam.h.
</EM><BR>
<P>Could you kindly tell me the location in /proc to change?
<BR>
<P>I did look in shmparam.h 
<BR>
<P>i386 had this
<BR>
#define SHMMAX 0x2000000        /* max shared seg size (bytes) */
<BR>
/* Try not to change the default shipped SHMMAX - people rely on it */
<BR>
33,554,432
<BR>
<P>alhpa had this
<BR>
#define SHMMAX 0x3fa000         /* max shared seg size (bytes) */
<BR>
4,169,728 bytes 
<BR>
<P>That is a hugh difference.  
<BR>
<P>However top shows 91072K shrd which is more than in the header file.
<BR>
So what is correct?
<BR>
<P>By the way why is it that True 64 Netscape does not launch a
<BR>
subprocess? It totally refuses to start any helper apps.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for the information.
<BR>
<P>Alan
