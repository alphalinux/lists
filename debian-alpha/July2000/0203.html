<P>&nbsp;:::&gt; Hmmm...is it possible that the disc in question is a rewritable?
<BR>
&nbsp;:::&gt; I've run into problems similar to this in the past with older
<BR>
&nbsp;:::&gt; CD-ROMs reading rewritable disks (older lasers can't read them).
<BR>
<P>The cdrom disks that gave the error were read only disks burned by a
<BR>
friend. I used a factory burned cdrom disk for all testing. Getting home
<BR>
made cdrom disks to work with older cdrom drives is problematic.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;:::&gt; Yeah, I recognised the model right off as being a problematic
<BR>
&nbsp;:::&gt; drive that I've run into in the past. The weird thing is, while
<BR>
&nbsp;:::&gt; diagnosing this, I realised that my old CD-ROM no longer worked,
<BR>
&nbsp;:::&gt; so I had to switch it with a newer one that I had laying around
<BR>
&nbsp;:::&gt; :-P
<BR>
<P>I'm going to remove that drive. The eide cdrom drive was a factory
<BR>
installed drive. I will probably call compaq and see if it is covered
<BR>
under the warranty.
<BR>
<P>I just tried the eide drive with 2.2.16 and I did not get those error
<BR>
messages in the /var/log/messages file. What was interesting though
<BR>
was I was playing an mp3 and the sound starting breaking up. Not a
<BR>
problem at all. Just can't play mp3's and 'dd' the eide cdrom drive.
<BR>
What is funny that mp3's play just fine while running 'dd' on the scsi
<BR>
cdrom drive. This eide drive is history. :-)) Got to play those mp3's!
<BR>
Don't have a clue weather this is the eide cdrom drive, eide cdrom
<BR>
driver or what??
<BR>
<P><P>Thanks
