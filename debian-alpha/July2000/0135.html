<P>
<EM>&gt; On Jul 20, Michael Stroucken scratched in indelible ink :
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	Doing some investigation, I found that in /etc/login.defs the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environment variable HZ is being set to 100 where it says it should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1024 on the alpha. Is that of any importance?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Personally I don't know what that env var does.  I have jsut done a fresh
<BR>
install of potato (it went *extremely* cleanly :) ) and my install also had
<BR>
the HZ=100 set.   It did not prevent root from su-ing to any user though ....
<BR>
<P>/Aside, after the reboot, nearing the end of the install process where
<BR>
debinstall tries to configure apt, I had a helluva time trying to get out of
<BR>
it.  (I really don't like dselect, and have always configured apt manually
<BR>
/outside/ of any config scripts.  I got frustrated after selecting cancel
<BR>
repeatedly and getting returned to the &quot;do you want to uninstall PCMCIA
<BR>
support?&quot;.
<BR>
This is probably more a question for the boot-floppies people, but is it
<BR>
possible to get a 'drop to shell' option, or put in the INSTALL-howto a
<BR>
description on how to avoid having to work out how to bomb out?
<BR>
(I did eventually get back to a shell, but have no idea how I did it.)
