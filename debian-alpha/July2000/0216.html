Hi,
<BR>
<P>since my base-install floppies (potato) are completely outdated, I
<BR>
decided to make new ones with uptodate *.bin for potential rescue
<BR>
purposes. I am a little bit confused now, because after dd etc. I cannot
<BR>
mount most of the floppies. It worked O.K. with the rescue.bin. It is
<BR>
readable as -text2 and shows files, but it does not work with root.bin,
<BR>
driver-1.bin and driver-2.bin. The older base-install *.bin had been
<BR>
dd-ed under RedHat prior to install. 
<BR>
<P>At first, I thought the floppies might have been corrupted. So I
<BR>
reformatted the floppies with superformat. What confuses me, is a
<BR>
changing value for deviation. Sometimes it says deviation=-1120,
<BR>
sometimes it says deviation=-1040.
<BR>
floppymeter gave the following values:
<BR>
capacity deviation= -1015 (again something different!)
<BR>
deviation on time_per_rotation= -920
<BR>
deviation on data transfer rate= -96
<BR>
<P>Are these values within normal? Is it a problem that the capacity
<BR>
deviation changes? Which value to choose for /etc/driveprm?
<BR>
<P>With a dd-ed floppy I get these outputs:
<BR>
<P>getfdprm looks normal: DS HD sect=18
<BR>
<P>/tmp/foo: gzip compressed data, deflated, last modified: Sat Jul 15
<BR>
00:58:41 2000, max compression, os: Unix
<BR>
<P>e2fsck /dev/fd0 gives the following error message:
<BR>
<P>e2fsck 1.18, 11-Nov-1999 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
<BR>
Couldn't find ext2 superblock, trying backup blocks...
<BR>
e2fsck: Attempt to read block from filesystem resulted in short read
<BR>
while trying to open /dev/fd0
<BR>
Could this be a zero-length partition?
<BR>
<P>Since several attempts with rescue.bin always have been successful and
<BR>
several attempts with root.bin, driver-1.bin or driver-2.bin always
<BR>
failed, I cannot help but thinking, that the *.bin files are not O.K.
<BR>
Can anybody tell me, what is going on here? Am I playing tricks to
<BR>
myself somehow? 
<BR>
<P><P>Thank you in advance,
<BR>
<P>regards,
<BR>
<P>Kerstin
