Hi,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As a non-Alpha user (but an aspirant one), I'm curious to know how the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'community' sees IA64? Is it perceived as a threat? Would alpha users
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be persuaded to switch over easily?
</EM><BR>
<P>The IA64 is very agreesive and new design wrt to microarchitecture. 
<BR>
As ooposed to that, Alpha (21264) is a state-of-art &quot;traditional&quot;
<BR>
architecture, which is already 64bit and performs quite well.
<BR>
Based on my experience, Alpha delivers, what you pay for: superior
<BR>
performance at a superior price-tag ;-)
<BR>
<P>The linux port to Alpha ( which is, what I use all of the time ) if
<BR>
proven, reliable and stable. Although GCC on Alpha is crap, the
<BR>
freely available Compaq-Compilers for Linux/Alpha do *very* well.
<BR>
<P>Important to me is workstation-class firmware: seriel consoles, netboot,
<BR>
decent development support and console-callbacks, a fair set of diagnostics.
<BR>
However, this counts for me, YMMV.
<BR>
<P>Based on my experience of Linux/IA64 on a dual IA64 prototype, performance
<BR>
is - at the moment - fairly poor, compared to a dual 21264. Of course, this
<BR>
is due to a lousy and unoptimized pre-production run of the sillicon.
<BR>
At the moment, no one can *really* tell how fast an IA64 will be. Too much 
<BR>
of the performance will also come from the surrounding chipset, like memory
<BR>
and I/O buses.
<BR>
<P>GCC on IA64 sucks, period. GCC has no means of optimizing towards a performant
<BR>
sequence of instruction-packets to be fed into the IA64 pipeline. The SGI
<BR>
compilers, which are free as well, do a much better job. I don't see
<BR>
any advantage on either side of the fence here - although the Compaq
<BR>
compilers appear very mature, from what I have seen so far. I can tell
<BR>
far less on behalf the SGI Compilers.
<BR>
<P>As for the Firmware stuff, I am *very* pleased how Compaq/Alpha handle
<BR>
things. They emulate x86-Bioses of standart I/O cards upon POST, which
<BR>
basically allows users to stuff an Alpha with a decent set of PCI Boards
<BR>
cheaply available on the market. As for IA64, I cannot tell how Intel
<BR>
will handle this - it might well be crucial for IA64's success.
<BR>
The same goes for the Firmware functionality in general. Intel has the
<BR>
unique opportunity of getting rid of the PC-crap, which is nothing more
<BR>
than a glorified DOS-loader, even by today. I assume, IA64 will not start
<BR>
in some real-mode and will not support Gate-A20.
<BR>
<P>As for the future, I doubt the extensions like ISSE, 3DNOW or even MVI will
<BR>
persist. Instead, I could imagine, that having fast network-links on
<BR>
chip for large-scale parallel machines will be a key point for any 
<BR>
architectures' success. This is planned on future Alphas, and I hope
<BR>
the Alpha team does this well. Putting a boat-load of ALU's in a VLIW
<BR>
architecture is also an interesting approach, but the validity of this
<BR>
concept will be proven in future IA64 versions, definitely not in the
<BR>
first run.
<BR>
<P>The biggest threat for Alpha is - IMHO - Intels manufacturing capabilities.
<BR>
If they can run a 256Kbyte on-chip L2-cache, accessed 256bit wide, at 1 GHz,
<BR>
they sure have some superior fabs at hand. If they can turn that advantage
<BR>
over to IA64, Alpha is in *serious* trouble.
<BR>
Given Intel's ability roll-out huge amounts on chips, along with their
<BR>
financial backing, I am certain they will try to buy-in the server market
<BR>
on price, if the acceptance of the IA64 does not develop fast enough in
<BR>
their opinion.
<BR>
<P>Whatever comes in the near or far future, Alpha is here already. It's proven,
<BR>
it's fast and I can actually *buy it*. I doubt, Intel will make it in
<BR>
the first attempt, but I assume future generations of the IA64 will be
<BR>
*very* interesting - but yet, this remains to be proven.
<BR>
<P>Since I have no religious or whaterver bias towards Intel, I don't really
<BR>
care. I would like to see Alpha succeed, since I think it's a Good Thing(TM).
<BR>
<P>Just my $.02
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
Thomas Weyergraf
