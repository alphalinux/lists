I'm trying to install the base system via floppies, but after it loads all 
<BR>
16 of the base disks, it begins to extract the files, which fails due to an 
<BR>
uncompression error. It does not complain at any point while reading the 
<BR>
disks, and I've used several different sets of new disks, am I just having 
<BR>
bad luck with my floppies, or is there something else I could look at? I'm 
<BR>
dd-ing the disks on a sun box.  I could write them on a alphaserver, but I'm 
<BR>
not supposed to be able to login to that machine (let alone su), and someone 
<BR>
might notice a bunch of linux files being ftp'd over, so I'd rather not.
<BR>
<P>I've got the SRM console and AlphaBIOS, which I recently flashed with the 
<BR>
updates from compaq. Before doing that I could not get it to boot off a 
<BR>
floppy at all. Now, it is set to run the SRM (TRUE64/unix setting), it tries 
<BR>
the harddrive, which was wiped before I got it and have since re-partitioned 
<BR>
anyway. It then boots from the floppy fine, and I can otherwise follow along 
<BR>
with dbootstrap as usual, until it starts building base2_2.tgz. I think it 
<BR>
dies before the file is complete because I could not find the base2_2.tgz 
<BR>
file.
