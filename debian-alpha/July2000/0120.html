Hi,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I need to divide between Bus 0 and Bus 1, since the SRM firmware
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; gets screwed if it finds multiple VGA-Bioses on Bus 0. It seems it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; doesn't try to x86-emulate Boards in Bus 1.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Can that be an explanation?  If a card is not initialised by its BIOS,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it may be in an undocumented state with which Xserver will not work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; correctly.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe. On the other hand, running the G200's in an x86 system as
<BR>
multihead *requires* turning of their BIOSes - I did that, by telling
<BR>
the systems Bios to initialize AGP-VGA first. I can't tell, what
<BR>
kind of init the cards really need. 
<BR>
Also, for exactly *that* scenario, XFree uses it's libint10.a, to initialize
<BR>
cards that have previously not been initialized by POST procedures.
<BR>
I assume, this fixes Alpha conflicts as well.
<BR>
But it sure is a pointer, that I will follow.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I guess the x86 machine runs all the VGA BIOSes, doesn't it?
</EM><BR>
<P>Hard to tell ( see above ). If I run the x86 with one of the G200's alone,
<BR>
it produces no grafics output ( yes, I switched BIOS back from AGP to PCI
<BR>
VGA ). The card's Bios appears to be turned off. There is a ( DOS based )
<BR>
Matrox utillity, that is supposed to display several characteristics of
<BR>
an installed Board. Running this with the AGP Voodoo as primary display and
<BR>
the G200 as secondary, it gives *nothing* on the G200 board - I therefore
<BR>
assume, the card has not been inited by BIOS routines.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There is an x86 emulator which is reported to initialise Matrox cards and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was apparently developed for use in multihead configurations.  Check out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="ftp://ftp.scitechsoft.com/devel/x86emu/">ftp://ftp.scitechsoft.com/devel/x86emu/</A> .
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanx for the pointer. I'll check that anyway.
<BR>
<P>However, one question still remains. Has anyone gotten XFree 4.0 running
<BR>
multihead+xinerama on Alpha's ?
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
Thomas Weyergraf
