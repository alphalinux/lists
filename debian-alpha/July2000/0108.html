<P>
<EM>&gt; On Jul 17, Alan P. Kennedy, Sr scratched in indelible ink :
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The windowmaker that comes with potato runs fine under alpha. I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one machine with windowmaker and so far no problems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
*nod* my as255 agrees with this statement.  wmaker has run quite happily for
<BR>
quite a while now.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I run X without any problems, and the only app that does not work that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have tried is cdparanoia. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
I have had no problems with cdparanoia.  but that does not need to run under
<BR>
X.  More details please and we can try and find your problem?
<BR>
<P>/Jp...
