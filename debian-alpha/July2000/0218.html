<P>
I have two AlphaStation 200 4/166 machines, which I currently have slink
<BR>
installed on. When I first installed them however, I tried to upgrade them
<BR>
to potato, but then the time went all wonky. hwclock returned the correct 
<BR>
time, but every other program turned up all sorts of interesting answers
<BR>
for the time. The time seemed to jump around randomly, showing no consistency.
<BR>
<P>Is there any particular reason why potato would behave differently than 
<BR>
slink?
<BR>
<P>I would like to upgrade the machines to a more recent version of linux, but 
<BR>
I don't want to ruin the installations.
<BR>
<P>Thanks
<BR>
