<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is this because of missing dependencies?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  Looks like you're missing a few packages there (including libesd0,
<BR>
libmikmod0, etc).  Try an 'apt-get update ; apt-get -u upgrade' and see if
<BR>
it says that it's going to install some packages.  If so, let it :-)
<BR>
<P>BTW, I'm assuming this is potato...correct?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I had another small problem. ppp would not work with older version of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; linux ppp. If it is important I could dig out the error messages, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't have them on hand right now. I had to upgrade to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ppp-2.4.0b2.tar.gz in order to get ppp to work. What was interesting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is that ppp worked fine with my isp. Found the solution in the Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; usenet newsgroups. For the record this was in the i386 distribution
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm...what kernel version are you running?  I know there was some
<BR>
problems with some versions (can't recall exactly which, but I can search
<BR>
if needed).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; PS: I can compile some debs if needed.
</EM><BR>
<P>No thanks.  I can handle the few that look like they need to be
<BR>
recompiled.  Thanks for the offer, though :-)
