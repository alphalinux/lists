<P>Hehehe...ok...and I've finished quite a few more already and pruned even
<BR>
further (removing the suggests stuff since it really doesn't matter much
<BR>
and many are virtual).

<P>Bombs.  Removed since it's a suggests.

</EM><BR>
<P>Non-US.

<EM>&gt; * Package libforms0.88-dev version 0.88.1-3 has an unmet dep:

<EM>&gt; * Package pike-mysql version 0.6.131-6 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *  Depends: libc6 (&gt;= 2.1.2)
</EM><BR>
<P>Done, binary NMUs.

<P>Arch: all :-(  Bug reports filed already.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; * Package twclock version 1.3-9 has an unmet dep:

<EM>&gt; *  Depends: libc6 (&gt;= 2.1.2-12)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * libc6 ?!
</EM><BR>
<P>Done...in incoming for a week now I think.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Package custom-mule version 1.9962-3 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Depends: mule2
</EM><BR>
<P>Mule2's been sitting in incoming forever now, but I can't figure out
<BR>
who compiled it or how.  It bombs when compiling for me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; * Package pcmcia-cs version 3.1.8-9 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *  Suggests: pcmcia-modules
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * I think pcmcia-modules is a virtual package
</EM><BR>
<P>pcmcia-modules can be compiled by the user, IMO.  It's only valid for a
<BR>
few older types of Alpha anyway.  Good news is, though, that the woody
<BR>
version works with kernels configured for &quot;generic&quot; types of alphas
<BR>
(FINALLY), so we can probably build this for woody, but potato will have
<BR>
to rely on the users to do this themselves.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Package pilot-template version 1.31-1 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Suggests: prc-tools
</EM><BR>
<P>prc-tools will never compile on alpha until they use the newer patches
<BR>
against gcc 2.95.2 (since this version is still reliant on gcc 2.7.x
<BR>
sources that were unpatched for alpha).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Package bb version 1.2-3.1 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Depends: slang0.99.38
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Depends: slang1 (&lt; 1.3)
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a PITA.  I sent in patches for bb to work and compile, but the
<BR>
maintainer never did anything other than remove alpha from the arch
<BR>
list. I've NMU'ed it anyway (binary) since a source NMU won't be accepted
<BR>
unless I bump the importance of the bug.  Screw it, this one is just one
<BR>
we'll have to send patches to users who want to compile it from source on
<BR>
Alpha... (this is getting REALLY old).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Package amcl version 0.4.2-2 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Depends: libglib1.1 (&gt;= 1.1.3-1)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Depends: libgtk1.1 (&gt;= 1:1.1.2-1)
</EM><BR>
<P>Working on this one.  Requires that I install some old gtk/glib combo to
<BR>
compile since it won't work with gtk1.2.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Package guitar version 0.1.4-7 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Suggests: rar
</EM><BR>
<P>Ignored.  rar is arch:i386 only due to asm in the source.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Package php3-snmp version 3:3.0.16-2potato3 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Depends: libsnmp4.0
</EM><BR>
<P>Done.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Package ssh-socks version 1.2.27-6 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Depends: libsocks
</EM><BR>
<P>Non-US.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Package unzip-crypt version 5.40-1.0 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Suggests: zip-crypt
</EM><BR>
<P>Same.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Package php3-cgi-snmp version 3:3.0.16-2potato3 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Depends: libsnmp4.0
</EM><BR>
<P>Done.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; * Package task-devel-common version 0.5 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *  Suggests: ltrace
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * ltrace isn't ported to alpha yet.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ignored anyway.  It's a suggests :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Package geda-gnetlist version 19991011-4 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Depends: libguile6 (&gt;= 1:1.3.4-3)
</EM><BR>
<P>All affected geda- packages are NMU'ed and in incoming.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Package gem version 0.81-7 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Depends: libstdc++2.9-glibc2.1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Package vice version 1.0-3 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Depends: libstdc++2.9-glibc2.1
</EM><BR>
<P>Done.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Package ale-clone-cogliati version 0.11-1 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Depends: ale-clone
</EM><BR>
<P>ale-clone can't be run until the ZPixMap stuff is ported to 64-bit archs
<BR>
(still not done in XFree86 4.0.x, fyi).  It requires that extension before
<BR>
it'll run (I've been down this road before).  Since the ale-clone-cogliati
<BR>
package is arch:all, I'm ignoring it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Package tochnog version 99.4.22-1 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Depends: libstdc++2.9-glibc2.1
</EM><BR>
<P>Done.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Package lilypond version 1.2.2-1 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Depends: libguile4 (&gt;= 1:1.3-15)
</EM><BR>
<P>Recommended for removal.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; * Package netstd version 3.07-17 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *  Suggests: wdsetup
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * wdsetup can't be compiled on alpha, probably others are the same.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, it's a suggests anyway, so no big deal.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Package emacs19 version 19.34-20.1 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Depends: liblockfile0 (&gt;= 0.1-1)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Depends: liblockfile0
</EM><BR>
<P>How long is emacs19 going to stick around?  I know I use emacs20 and can't
<BR>
imagine going back to emacs19 (which requires heavy patching to
<BR>
compile).  I have a patch for it somewhere, but it's a bit late at this
<BR>
point to worry about.  It's a shame, though...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Package moonlight version 0.5.3-2 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Depends: libstdc++2.9
</EM><BR>
<P>Newer versions won't compile due to C++ errors.  Will recommend for
<BR>
removal.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Package xmahjongg version 3.0b10-1 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Depends: libstdc++2.9-glibc2.1
</EM><BR>
<P>Done.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Package w3-el-e19 version 4.0pre.46-7 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Depends: emacs19 (&gt;= 19.34-21)
</EM><BR>
<P>See above.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Package pavuk version 0.9pl24-1 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Depends: libsocks
</EM><BR>
<P>Non-US.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Package ipmasq version 3.4.4 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Suggests: midentd
</EM><BR>
<P>???  Beats me.  I can't find midentd anywhere for any arch.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Package libdb2.6-dev version 2.6.4-6 has an unmet dep:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Depends: libdb2.6 (= 2.6.4-6)
</EM><BR>
<P>Oldlibs.  This part of the report doesn't agree with my available list
<BR>
either, so I'm ignoring it.
<BR>
<P>That's it.  Everything's pretty much done except for the non-US stuff
<BR>
(which I'm assuming I'll have to defer to Bart, who usually handles non-US
<BR>
for us).  Like I said, at this point, though, I'm binary NMU'ing
<BR>
everything in sight since alot of patches were ignored or not submitted in
<BR>
time and probably won't be important enough to change the momentum of
<BR>
releasing potato.  Figured we'll deal with the problems in a point release
<BR>
afterwards (or in woody).
