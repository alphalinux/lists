Hi guys,
<BR>
<P>Since both dark and I have been absent for the last week or so the number
<BR>
of RC bugs has ballooned outrageously, and some of your uploads and such
<BR>
have been left sitting in incoming, and as such the release hasn't gotten
<BR>
significantly closer. Sorry about that. :(
<BR>
<P>In any event, we'll hopefully get incoming cleared out shortly, and have
<BR>
i386 done in a day or two. Hopefully.
<BR>
<P>How does this leave everyone else? A few days ago sparc needed to do a
<BR>
whole bunch of recompiles. Have these been done? Are there any similar
<BR>
things that other archs have only just discovered they need to do and
<BR>
are just doing now?
<BR>
<P>At this point, as far as i386 is concerned I expect most problems will
<BR>
be ignored, save for maybe a couple of removals, a couple of upgrades,
<BR>
and a handful of security fixes which will probably still be being added
<BR>
at a fairly late stage.
<BR>
<P>On an only marginally related matter, I'd appreciate it if y'all could
<BR>
get woody autobuilders happening fairly promptly and effectively by
<BR>
the time potato releases. If there are hardware or bandwidth problems,
<BR>
it'd be nice to resolve these ASAP, rather than JIT...
<BR>
<P>Please note the excessive cross-posting, and edit your followups to suit.
<BR>
I'm not on most of these lists, so if there's something I need to know
<BR>
that's not appropriate for -release, please cc me. Thanks.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
aj (acting release manager)
<BR>

I don't speak for anyone save myself. GPG signed mail preferred.
