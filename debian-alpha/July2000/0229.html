<P><EM>&gt; &gt; There's something &quot;wonky&quot; about the handling of the time value,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; although it's not been followed up on. Probably that the potato
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; libc stuff expects a 64-bit value, and 2.0 kernels only return
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 32 bits. Or vice versa.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Much more probable is that one of kernels in question was compiled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with an RTC support and the other without and/or glibc used
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does not recognize automatically a type of the board and needs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;alpha_systype&quot; link in /etc.  As far as RTC goes there are boards
</EM><BR>
<P>No, that's not the problem here. If it was, he wouldn't have made the
<BR>
statement &quot;... time seemed to jump around randomly...&quot;. If the RTC is
<BR>
the problem, the date would be off by a number of years, but the time
<BR>
would still increment normally. Note that the RTC is only used at
<BR>
boot time to initially set the kernel time, and after that the kernel
<BR>
keeps its own time.

<P><EM>&gt; In this particular case it is highly unlikely that you see a result
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of 32-bit vs. 64-bit issues.
</EM><BR>
<P>Please try it for yourself :-) It was hashed out here in the list
<BR>
I think almost a year ago. It is definitely an incompatibility in
<BR>
the potato libs which simply won't work on a 2.0 kernel as far as
<BR>
time is concerned.
