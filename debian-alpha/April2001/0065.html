<P>
Just wanted to announce this...
<BR>
<P>I'm removing the cross-compiler patches to debian/rules, etc. as
<BR>
of the upcoming 2.11.90.0.5-1.  Until we get a better method for compiling
<BR>
these, I'd rather not have the packages available.  As it stands, it takes
<BR>
several hours to build binutils and all of the cross- packages on my fast
<BR>
Alpha and I don't even want to know how long on m68k (up to a day, IIRC).
<BR>
<P>Gcc still hasn't found a good way to avoid this kind of multiple package
<BR>
generation and, until we/they do, I'd rather have binutils agree with that
<BR>
stance.  If anything, this may help force the issue a bit (fingers
<BR>
crossed).
<BR>
<P>So far, keeping up the cross- packages has been quite a bit of work for me
<BR>
and I've received very little feedback as to whether or not the packages
<BR>
are actually useful enough to warrant this.  I have received a number of
<BR>
bugs against those packages, though, so I'd rather do this right and in
<BR>
concert with gcc (since you'll need a proper gcc cross-compiler generated
<BR>
to use them anyway) rather than spend hours trying to keep up packages
<BR>
that will end up being heavily modified in the future anyway.
<BR>
<P>If there are any objections, please feel free to email me.  I don't plan
<BR>
on keeping them buried forever...only until a better way is found to
<BR>
generate them in a policy-compliant manner and also in manner that
<BR>
won't impact slower/older architectures like m68k quite as much....
<BR>
<P>C
