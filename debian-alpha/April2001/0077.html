<EM>&gt; &gt; AlphaStation 255 (at least, I'm not having any problems I didn't have

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ac means Alan Cox patches doesn't it? Totally different story, apparently.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There appears to be generally a lot more success the ac stream than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generic kernel.
</EM><BR>
<P>as for the stock 2.4.3, there are issues. The mm/numa structure has been changed quite
<BR>
significantly btw 2.4.2 and 2.4.3. Unfortunately, the changes were adopted for some
<BR>
archs, but not all - with alpha being one of them. This causes the build errors.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;From close to day 1, there has been a patch around, that addresses this error. It's
</EM><BR>
called alpha-numa-2 and can be retrieved from ftp.kernel.org in Andrea Arcangeli's
<BR>
people-subdir. All the 2.4.3-ac3 does, is integrating this patch.
<BR>
<P>IMHO, the -ac series is problematic at best in various cases and should be considered
<BR>
with extreme caution. In my experience, all release kernels 2.4.[0,1,2] worked quite
<BR>
well for me, set aside the well known bugs, like loop-devices etc...
<BR>
<P>At the present time, I would go with 2.4.2 and the generic kernel series. I did get 2.4.3
<BR>
to compile OK, but I didn't use it due to the fact, that the alpha-numa-2 patch changed
<BR>
the mm subsystem in such a substantial way, that i did not want to be a tester for
<BR>
that on my production-alpha. IMHO, the 2.4.x kernels are not quite ready for prime-time
<BR>
in all situations. I use them in a very conservative setup and therefore leave out most
<BR>
of it's advanced and aggressive features ( like Reiser, NFS-v3, devfs and the like ). For
<BR>
these features, I use an x86 with kernel 2.2.18/19, which is more stable on most of the
<BR>
advanced features mentioned above.
<BR>
With the conservative setup, kernel 2.4.2 works *very* well for me, but everybody has
<BR>
to be warned, that this might not be the case for them, especially, if it comes to alphas.
<BR>
<P>I just wished, Compaq would get it's act together and form a team, that would carefully
<BR>
adopt changes to alpha and try to keep the 2.4.x-pre series as current as x86, wrt
<BR>
fundamental subsystem changes and try to fold those changes back to Linus' pre-tree.
<BR>
I'm probably not the only one being convinced, that Alpha's future is bound to Linux.
<BR>
<P>Just my dreams and $.02
