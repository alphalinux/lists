<EM>&gt; hmmm...i think it's coping quite well.  So far all the packages that do

<P>Hmm, my list (available via <A HREF="http://auric.debian.org/~paul/alpha/diff/">http://auric.debian.org/~paul/alpha/diff/</A> )
<BR>
shows about 280 out of date packages in main. Of course, that's
<BR>
binary packages, not source packages (which is estimated at 116,
<BR>
including packages already uploaded but not yet installed).
<BR>
There are also 85 source packages not yet built for alpha at all in
<BR>
main, but that's probably for a large part down to arch non-alpha.
<BR>
<P>My concern was raised by the fact that my list has steadily grown in
<BR>
length from about 490 lines a month ago, to over 800 the last couple
<BR>
of days.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; which the buildd shouldn't be doing anyways...others have problems do to

<EM>&gt; them bing c++ w/ optimization...
</EM><BR>
<P>I have a nifty little wrapper for c++ which first exec'ed the real
<BR>
binary as-is, and if that exited with exit status != 0, exec'ed it again
<BR>
with -O0. Works pretty well :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and then of course the buildd just got kicked off for todays run right after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I got that 225 number...  a week ago we were at 50 packages needing built...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so with all the compiler issues we have been having I think that the buildd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is coping quite well.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm, OK... It's just that I saw my list getting longer and longer,
<BR>
whereas it was getting shorter and shorter when we were still building
<BR>
by hand. I'll root through it and at least filter out the non-alpha
<BR>
stuff that's new since I last did that.
