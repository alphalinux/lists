<P>
G'day,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry to bother you all again but I'm stuck.  After turfing my
<BR>
annoying video card and putting in some ISA card that was made back when
<BR>
the used to build pyramids all was well.
<BR>
<P>But I'm trying to get SRM installed.  Currently the PC164SX has the
<BR>
AlphaBIOS installed, SRM looks more useful to me. So I downloaded the
<BR>
sx154_v5_6.exe firmware upgrade program from Digital's ftp site stuck it
<BR>
on a floppy.
<BR>
<P>I tried first to go into AlphaBIOS and sleect update firmware from the
<BR>
menu. The floppy drive ran for a while then nothing happened. It just
<BR>
locked up.
<BR>
<P>OK, so next I flipped dipswitch 7 which got me a blue screen that looked
<BR>
a bit like what i should be getting. But nistead of a &gt;&gt;&gt; prompt I
<BR>
got a mini menu.  I then selected update from this menu and once again
<BR>
the floppy drive started.
<BR>
<P>It mentioned two words, I think they were fsb and fw.
<BR>
fsb came back with something like update ok or some other 'good
<BR>
message'.
<BR>
fw said something like not found and then had some filename like
<BR>
nt_fw.???
<BR>
<P>Then I got the menu back.  Rebooting the box got me AlphaBIOS again.
<BR>
<P>I'm going to go over and re-read the instructions again, not easy
<BR>
considering the documents contradict themseleves.
<BR>
<P>Like this:

<A HREF="http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/readmes/alphapc164sx.html">http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/readmes/alphapc164sx.html</A>
<BR>
(referring to sx164_v5_6.exe)
<BR>
<P>&quot;  Copy the downloaded file(s) to a blank FAT formatted floppy as :
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fwupdate.exe
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IMPORTANT: The filename must remain what you downloaded it as&quot;
<BR>
<P>Brilliant! It must be sx164_v5_6.exe and fwupdate.exe at the same time.
<BR>
I called it fwupdate.exe
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Craig
