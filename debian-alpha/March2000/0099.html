<P>
I've got a relatively new DS10 at work that I've been trying to install
<BR>
Slink on since last Friday with no avail.  I've never tried to install on an
<BR>
alpha before, so I'm just learning the ins and outs of this architecture.
<BR>
If I'm completely off base in what I'm trying to do here please let me know.
<BR>
<P>I'm working with SRM as far as I can tell (I get the &quot;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot; prompt).  I've
<BR>
set the bootdef_dev to dqa0, which is the CD-ROM drive on this machine, and
<BR>
boot_file to /boot/generic/linux, which seems to point to the kernel on my
<BR>
CD.  On occasion, I have even set boot_flags to &quot;root=/dev/hda&quot;.
<BR>
<P>After typing &quot;boot&quot; at the prompt SRM does a few things and then a linux
<BR>
kernel starts booting.  It's hard to see what all is happening because it
<BR>
scrolls so fast, but it seems to be detecting the hardware and doing normal
<BR>
things I would expect to see a kernel doing during boot.  Then, WHAMMO!  I'm
<BR>
back at the SRM prompt and I have a message that the kernel has halted.  I
<BR>
think it says the halt code is 5.
<BR>
<P>I really hope this isn't a RTFM, 'cause I've been reading the FM all day
<BR>
today and haven't gotten anything to work.  Has anyone installed Debian on a
<BR>
DS10?  I can get RedHat installed on the same machine, but I'd much rather
<BR>
get Debian up and running.
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
