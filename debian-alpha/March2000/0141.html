<P><EM>&gt; Hrm.  Not sure, offhand.  This disk was downloaded from the images-1.44
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; directory under potato/, probably ~ 3/24.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah okay, that was one of my builds then.  Those MILO disks were
<BR>
actually 720k images, that might have been the problem :)
<BR>
<P>It wastes too much space to make them all 1.44 meg images, so with
<BR>
2.2.9 there will just be loose MILO and LINLOAD.EXE binaries and
<BR>
you'll have to assemble your own disk (all you have to do is make a
<BR>
DOS floppy and put the two files on it, so...)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Also, there appears to be another bug in MILO where it can't read ext2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; filesystems with 4k blocks.  Unfortunately, mke2fs seems to create ext2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; filesystems &gt;512 megs with 4k blocks, by default.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah.  The Debian installer for potato will now ask you if you want to
<BR>
make 2.0 compatible filesystems.
<BR>
<P>aboot supports filesystems with 4k blocks, and its filesystem code is
<BR>
closely related to MILO's ... it shouldn't be hard to port the patch
<BR>
back to MILO, the problem is that building MILO is such an ordeal that
<BR>
only a few brave people (hi Nikita :) do it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; While this would be best fixed in MILO, where the problem lies, would it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at least be possible to implement a workaround in the installation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; program?  I had to jump to a shell and create a filesystem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manually.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup, already done :) Actually the option was there before, it was just
<BR>
hidden (you had to pass the &quot;verbose&quot; option on the kernel command line)
