<P>
i've been trying for SEVERAL days to build a new, workable kernel for my
<BR>
as200@100mhz.  obviously, it takes forever to try new things.  :)  
<BR>
<P>i can't seem to compile *any* kernel- not even 2.0.36 as distributed with
<BR>
the slink distro.  i finally built *just* the modules i needed (sound, to
<BR>
build an entertainment-center-mp3-box :) ) and got marginally up to speed
<BR>
that way.  
<BR>
<P>i'm really puzzled about the &quot;length error&quot; message i've been getting at
<BR>
bootup with kernels that i compile.  the code builds, i get a kernel image
<BR>
and modules, but it just doesn't boot.  it *looks* like its going to
<BR>
unzip, but doesn't.  it gets as far as running 3-4 lines of hashes across
<BR>
the screen, but where i expect to see it say &quot;now booting&quot; or whatever, it
<BR>
dies.  :0
<BR>
<P>many thanks in advance... i'm up and running again (had redhat for ages
<BR>
before... since the 5.0 days...) but i'd really like a more recent kernel
<BR>
than 2.0.36 :)
<BR>
