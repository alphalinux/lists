<P><EM>&gt;As to what &quot;Machine check while in PAL mode&quot; means:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;PAL is Priveleged Architecture Library, and implements various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;low-level functionality, like fault vectors, interrupts, etc.  PAL is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a chip mode that is supposed to run atomically (i.e.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;non-interruptable).  If an event that triggers PAL mode occurs when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;already executing in PAL mode, you get this machine check.  My sources
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tell me (I work at Compaq in the Alpha group) that there's not much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;left at this point to try to debug what happened.  My machine is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Pyxis Rev B board, and has known bugs (in the chipset) relating to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;DMA.  I'd be interested to hear the source of your LX; I've been led
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to believe that revenue-quality boards should not have this problem.
</EM><BR>
<P>Bought from GND (www.gnd.co.uk) -- I don't have the motherboard manual
<BR>
to hand but I'll try to remember to look up the model information.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;When I had this problem, I turned off various kernel options (IDE DMA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;especially) and that seemed to restrict the problem to soundcard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;access.  At that point I gave up and went back to AlphaBIOS and MILO,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and have been running happily ever since.  Evidently the MILO PALcode
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is different enough to not trigger the problem.
</EM><BR>
<P>I switched from AlphaBIOS to MILO because I want to use a serial
<BR>
console and to the best of my knowledge AlphaBIOS doesn't support that.
<BR>
(plus SRM's user interface is much nicer than AlphaBIOS's).
<BR>
<P>Do I have some other alternative? Perhaps booting from SRM and immediately
<BR>
replacing the SRM PALcode with something else, preferably something
<BR>
for which sources are available? Alternatively can MILO be flashed
<BR>
in as a replacement for SRM altogether on these machines?
