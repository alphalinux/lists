<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Also, there appears to be another bug in MILO where it can't read ext2

<EM>&gt; &gt; filesystems &gt;512 megs with 4k blocks, by default.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yeah.  The Debian installer for potato will now ask you if you want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make 2.0 compatible filesystems.
</EM><BR>
<P>The installer did, and I answered yes, the 2nd time around - however, it
<BR>
didn't seem to fix the problem (I rebooted and tried ls sda2:/ from MILO
<BR>
before installing - I should have at least seen lost+found, but did not).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; aboot supports filesystems with 4k blocks, and its filesystem code is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; closely related to MILO's ... it shouldn't be hard to port the patch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; back to MILO, the problem is that building MILO is such an ordeal that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only a few brave people (hi Nikita :) do it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would have gone with aboot, but I wanted to get this box set up, and it
<BR>
already had MILO.  I didn't really want to go playing with partitions, and
<BR>
a console + loader that I was unfamiliar with... &lt;sigh&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; While this would be best fixed in MILO, where the problem lies, would it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; at least be possible to implement a workaround in the installation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; program?  I had to jump to a shell and create a filesystem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; manually.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yup, already done :) Actually the option was there before, it was just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hidden (you had to pass the &quot;verbose&quot; option on the kernel command line)
</EM><BR>
<P>Hrm.  dbootstrap actually asked me if I wanted to keep 2.0 compatibility,
<BR>
without passing the verbose option.  As stated above, it didn't seem to
<BR>
work.  :)
