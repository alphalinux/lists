<P>
Insert the Driver Floppy and let it load. You will then be prompted to
<BR>
configure the modules. Don't do anything with it for now. Just say ok to
<BR>
the module prompts and continue with the rest of the installation. Get the
<BR>
base system installed and configured, then go through the dselect process.
<BR>
Make sure you get an ftp client. 
<BR>
<P>You will likely get some messages saying you have a 2.2.12 kernel and
<BR>
2.2.whatever module directories on boot up. That's ok, the kernel has what
<BR>
you need for now compiled in. Once you compile your new kernel and reboot,
<BR>
then the modules and kernel will be in sync.
<BR>
<P>This process assumes that the generic kernel has what you need for your
<BR>
hardware compiled into it.

<EM>&gt; Okay, I've gotten to &quot;Install Operating System Kernel and Modules&quot;.  My
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; filesystems are mounted, it asks what device I want to install off of, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; say fd0, it asks for the Rescue Floppy and installs it.  I've got the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.2.12 kernel on the Rescue Floppy, so I'm assuming that it installs the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.2.12 kernel on the hard drive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But then it asks for the Drivers Floppy....  The Slink Drivers Floppies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; won't work with the 2.2.12 Kernel, will they?  Plus, when I look at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; file system there's a /target/lib/modules/2.2.2-ac7 directory that's chock
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; full of goodies.  Again, I'm assuming that those are courtesy of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Rescue Floppy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I guess my question is, what should I do at the &quot;Driver Floppy&quot; prompt.
