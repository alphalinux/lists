</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That's not necessary on Linux/Alpha, actually.  The problem is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; our tools for creating BSD disklabels are damaged by the need to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compatible with BSD.  The disklabel is actually a far superior type
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of partitioning, it's just that there is historical brain damage in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BSD and derived operating systems like OSF/1.
</EM><BR>
<P>But there seems to be some magic behind the BSD disklabels, because if
<BR>
I created a partition &quot;d&quot; (ca. 1 GB), mke2fs wasn't able to create a
<BR>
filesystem on this partition but told me that the partition is too
<BR>
small.  So I removed &quot;d&quot; and created &quot;e&quot; (with the same start and end
<BR>
cylinders) and everything worked all right.  Maybe this were bugs of
<BR>
the fdisk on the slink boot disk (SRM-HOWTO also mentions a bug in
<BR>
some fdisk versions, which allows to make the last partition one
<BR>
cylinder wider than possible, this bug is in the slink bootdisks
<BR>
fdisk, but it is solved in the potato util-linux' fdisk...).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; (CONFIG_ALPHA_SRM needs to be &quot;yes&quot; now, while it is switched off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in the kernel-image-2.2.14-avanti kernel).
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That's because the subarchitecture-specific kernels were all built
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the assumption that people would be using MILO (even when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; booting MILO from SRM).
</EM><BR>
<P>That's why I was surprised not to find a MILO package in potato...
<BR>
But now aboot works very well and I no longer want to get MILO running
<BR>
on the harddisk.
<BR>
<P>BTW: It may be a good idea to mention the above option in
<BR>
aboot/README.Debian, because otherwise a alpha newbie like me has a
<BR>
very hard job to find all these tricks out (without CONFIG_ALPHA_SRM
<BR>
the kernel simply stops while computing bogomips).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Now everything works and the machine boots with a simple &quot;b&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;Enter&quot; keypress.  Is there any chance to automatically boot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (without any keypress) the machine after a certain timeout?  Maybe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; by setting some special SRM variable?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; set auto_action boot
</EM><BR>
<P>And how can I switch this off, if I need to access the SRM console
<BR>
again (if the above switch automatically boots, I won't get a SRM
<BR>
prompt, so I don't see how to undo this...).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It's documented, but not very well :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Where do I find some documentation about all this?  I got the
<BR>
AlphaStation 200 4/166 without any documentation (only the plain
<BR>
machine with a bus mouse and a (German) LK411 keyboard). I was really
<BR>
happy to get this working under Linux, the old slink installation
<BR>
manual wasn't a big help, but the README in the boot-disks folder
<BR>
helped me very much (otherwise I had never found the correct boot
<BR>
disks and had never found out how to start MILO from floppy etc.).
<BR>
<P>Tschoeeee
