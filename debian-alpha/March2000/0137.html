<P>Which one?  2.2.8?  2.2.9-pre?  Christian's old set?  We need details.

Things are changing very fast.

<P>In fact, the new rescue disks aren't bootable by MILO at all because
<BR>
there is no space for it (this is MILO's fault for being a pig, aboot
<BR>
and APB both fit on a floppy with the kernel just fine).  You should
<BR>
be using a separate disk with MILO and linload.exe to get into MILO,
<BR>
then boot the rescue disk from there.

<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Oddly enough, I could read the image from Linux (the system currently runs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Redhat 5.2), but an ls from MILO just gave me some % and /s, as well as

<EM>&gt; &gt;failing to boot.  So I made a new image, copying the files from the

<EM>&gt; &gt;original image (I also uncompressed vmzlinux.gz, to make sure the gzipped

<P>The rescue disks are not just plain ext2 filesystems.  They also
<BR>
contain SRM boot blocks.  It's possible that srmbootfat is giving
<BR>
problems.  Since we don't use it anymore anyway (booting MILO from SRM
<BR>
is just a bad idea), there won't be any more such problems.
<BR>
<P>If MILO can't read them while Linux can, then this is a bug in MILO.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Attached to this email is the new rescue image for potato (Alpha).  You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;should find that everything is the same - even the kernel, when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;uncompressed, should match the kernel on your original rescue disk.
</EM><BR>
<P>As noted above it's not really the same.
