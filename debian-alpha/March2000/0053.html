<P><EM>&gt; This also makes the directory layout a lot cleaner.  Since we don't

<EM>&gt; have any disk sizes other than 1.4M on Alpha, in 2.2.9, I think I will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remove the intervening images-1.44/ directories (all we need to do is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make dbootstrap not default to looking in these directories on Alpha -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sparc may want to do this too),
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't like this idea.  For one, I don't know why you couldn't have
<BR>
2.88 disk images, for instance, for a combined boot/root.  For two,
<BR>
even if you only have one floppy size, it's still interesting to have
<BR>
the image-1.44 dir since it is clear what files are the disk images.
<BR>
<P>Finally, deviating from having it be the same or generally the same on
<BR>
all architectures makes it all that much harder to document and
<BR>
maintain stuff.
