Hi,
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.debian.org/~dhd/disks-alpha-20000319/">http://www.debian.org/~dhd/disks-alpha-20000319/</A>
<BR>
<P>Things of note:
<BR>
<P>1) Nautilus/APB support - please test this on the UP1000!  Also I'd
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appreciate comments on the Nautilus-related documentation.
<BR>
<P>2) Serial console installations should basically work now (they were
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rather broken on all archs, and in fact not really enabled on Alpha
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at all).  You just have to boot with console=ttyS0 (I really tried
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to find a way to hack around this in aboot, but the CTB entry
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pointed to by the TTY_DEV environment variable in SRM comes up as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;multifunction&quot; regardless of whether I boot using serial or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;graphics console :P)
<BR>
<P>3) Nikita's tftpboot.img stuff is built by default (I'm considering
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just incorporating the relevant parts of the kernel source tree in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the boot-floppies CVS, as they're pretty small and we have to patch
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them anyway).  There's also a root.tar.gz which isn't particularly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;useful since I didn't put in a netbootable kernel image - but that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can certainly be arranged (we need to include objstrip in the aboot
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;package)
<BR>
<P>I've tested this stuff on a headless DS10 and it works okay - it has a
<BR>
tendency to hang unexpectedly at random moments, which I have no hope
<BR>
of figuring out the cause of.  Other issues:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;- Alpha's netbase is out of date, and I didn't get around to building
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a new one for the boot-floppies (my signing key is on a floppy at
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;home), so DHCP won't work when you reboot since it wants to use
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dhcpcd.  Just run pump manually.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;- fdisk is still a bit strange, not all of DEC's and my patches are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in it yet.  I'm a bit curious about whether minlabel would be a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;better choice or not...
<BR>
