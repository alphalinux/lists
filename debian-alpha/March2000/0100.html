<P>The most frequent cause for halt at this stage is &quot;kernel panic: unable to

mount root partition,&quot; which is quite strange given the &quot;root=/dev/hda&quot;
<BR>
parameter in boot_flags.  It might (unlikely, though) be that the CD-ROM
<BR>
is detected as a different IDE device - hdc, hdb or hdd, but other than
<BR>
that, I can't think of any reason why it won't boot.  Maybe somebody who
<BR>
remembers slink kernel and CD layout could help?
