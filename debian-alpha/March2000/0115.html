<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - Installing kernel and modules kind of worked... it worked but it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; didn't increment to the next step
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, that's because it installed an uncompressed kernel as
<BR>
/boot/vmlinux, but the main menu code looks for /boot/vmlinuz in order
<BR>
to determine whether the kernel is installed.  Now it installs a
<BR>
compressed kernel as /boot/vmlinuz (the PowerPC people are going to
<BR>
have to fix this eventually since they use uncompressed kernels)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - The tulip driver only got installed if I manually modprobe'd it myself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or forced it via Configure Drivers
</EM><BR>
<P>I presume you used the 2.2.8 disks then.  Try the ones I put on
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/dhd,">http://www.debian.org/dhd,</A> they have the de4x5 driver built in.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - aboot didn't install... still not sure why (I left 4megs at the start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the disk for it)... but the rescue was easy enough
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah - again, fixed on the pre-2.2.9 disks
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - the default aboot.conf was setup really weird... I installed to sda1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but it was setup to boot off of sda2
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, dbootstrap runs abootconf to set the default partition, and
<BR>
doesn't put the partition number in aboot.conf.  So if you installed
<BR>
aboot manually, you got the default of 2.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - doing an swriteboot /dev/sda bootlx still didn't get me a device where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I could 'boot dka0' but 'boot dka100' works so I'm assuming it's just my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ignorance of aboot
</EM><BR>
<P>The new aboot's swriteboot preserves the old default partition when
<BR>
it's run.  In your case it seems this wasn't much of a feature :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - dhcp/pump don't work... I'll probably do some debugging on this to see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what I can do
</EM><BR>
<P>In dbootstrap, or after the initial boot?  The latter is a known
<BR>
problem - because the netbase maintainer hasn't incorporated the patch
<BR>
I sent to make it build on Alpha yet ... probably he's waiting to fix
<BR>
the other bugs before releasing a new package.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - Multia's are *not* Y2k complaint in any sense of the word. Setting the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; date in SRM yields 1980. After rebooting (even if the date was set in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the hardware using hwclock) the date is read from the hardware as 2176.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If I use hwclock to write it to the hardware and read it back (without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rebooting) it is correct.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's because hwclock is really, really stupid.  The kernel's RTC
<BR>
driver knows how to guess the console epoch correctly, but hwclock
<BR>
seems to think the SRM epoch is 1900 (it's 1952), and then &quot;windows&quot;
<BR>
the number it gets.  This should get fixed soon, I hope...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - I've figured out how to set the default when just 'boot' is executed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the SRM but I haven't figured out a way to get it to auto-boot to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it... preferably with a delay before it's executed but I'd live with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just automatically booting into it.
</EM><BR>
<P>set auto_action boot
<BR>
<P>See the updated SRM HOWTO in /usr/share/doc/aboot for more info...
