<EM>&gt; &gt; Because we *need* to ship that version of MILO, I fear we'll have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; go back to my system of creating separate MILO/linload.exe images (we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; can of course make them significantly smaller than 1.4M :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If we can't tweak our kernels to fit we've got to go that road.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah - also see the bug I filed - we really should have the de4x5
<BR>
driver compiled in.  Actually I notice that my 2.2.15pre12 kernels
<BR>
aren't terribly large (, and they might almost fit
<BR>
<P>I'm going back to the separate MILO disks (which are now 720k images,
<BR>
since MILO is only 450k or so - it should work fine since FAT12 is a
<BR>
pretty dumb filesystem).  However, I've parameterized the set of
<BR>
architectures for which we build rescue disks - the &quot;small&quot; set is
<BR>
generic and jensen (because it appears that the generic kernel has
<BR>
some problems on Jensen).  If you want to build the full set, with
<BR>
MILO on the rescue disks you can say:
<BR>
<P>make alpha_reduced_rescue_set=NO write_milo=YES build_milo_disks=NO
<BR>
<P>By the way, it *is* necessary to install the System.map, otherwise
<BR>
procps and some other things complain at you.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is there anywhere a document on the current status of SRMs for the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different subarchs ? Which platforms are still depending on MILOs ?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From what I've been told, XL is the only architecture that has no SRM
</EM><BR>
available.  I've put a pointer to the firmware updates page on
<BR>
Compaq's website in the install documentation.
<BR>
<P>The cases where MILO is still useful are (and I guess this should go
<BR>
in the documentation) where the user:
<BR>
<P>a) is dual-booting with NT on a half-flash machine
<BR>
<P>b) is dual-booting with NT from a single disk on a full-flash machine
<BR>
<P>c) is reinstalling onto a DOS-partitioned disk with existing
<BR>
partitions
<BR>
<P>d) has a half-flash machine and doesn't want to reflash their
<BR>
firmware (or has a full-flash machine and can't figure out how to
<BR>
switch to SRM from AlphaBIOS :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; One other thing to mention: if we are going to provide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; subarch-specific kernels (the only machine that really needs this in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; order to boot is Jensen), then we should also provide kernel disks for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; DP264 and Nautilus, particularly since I've added them to the list of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; subarchitectures in the documentation :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The 2.2.14 alpha images were built by myself because Herbert didn't
</EM><BR>
<P>I guess the bug that I filed against them (the de4x5 driver isn't
<BR>
built in - it really needs to be) goes to you then :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; build them for quite some time after the i386 release. DP264, Nautilus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and book1 didn't compile so we left them out. Like I said above
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, yeah, nautilus and dp264 both need some patches, which will be in
<BR>
2.2.15.  But I would really rather go with the generic kernel only for
<BR>
SRM boots (except on Jensen) because it saves a lot of space, and it
<BR>
looks like we're telling people to recompile their kernel after
<BR>
installing anyway.
<BR>
<P>For woody I'd really like to do something like Red Hat does where it
<BR>
detects if your machine is SMP, except for alpha subarchitectures,
<BR>
then installs the proper kernel after the initial boot (policy be
<BR>
damned :)
