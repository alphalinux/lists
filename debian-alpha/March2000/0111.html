<P><EM>&gt;  How in h..l do I install aboot on a secondary unit and how much space is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  needed for it ?
</EM><BR>
<P>Secondary unit?  I'm not following you.  The default is to install
<BR>
aboot on the same disk as the kernel was installed (for the simple
<BR>
reason that aboot can't read devices other than the one it was booted
<BR>
from)
<BR>
<P>The aboot on the boot floppies weighs in at about 80k, or 160 sectors.
<BR>
It will fail to install if it overlaps with the first partition, but
<BR>
I'd play it safe and give it at least 512k or maybe a megabyte.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Can aboot only boot a kernel on the device it starts up on ?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  While it's theoretically possible for aboot to read from any
<BR>
device that SRM knows about, the device strings which you pass to the
<BR>
console's open() function are completely system-dependent, as far as I
<BR>
can tell.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Can I change root when I have booted ? ( before init does all its deeds :-) )
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, I don't really know what you want to do.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Also I messed up bsd disklabels :-( is c really needed ?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, in fact you should probably not use it unless you want Tru64 or
<BR>
Net/Open/FreeBSD to be able to read the disk.
