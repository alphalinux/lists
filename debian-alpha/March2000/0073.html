Hi,
<BR>
<P>I have a UDB running slink (frozen) that I would like to install as a
<BR>
masq box.  I currently have another UDB performing this same function
<BR>
running redhat, but I would like to move the services from it onto other
<BR>
machines.  The second box is setup for testing, but it hangs often (at
<BR>
least once a week, at most, within a couple hours) with errors in the
<BR>
NCR SCSI driver.  I'm running kernel 2.2.14 with the NCR810 driver. 
<BR>
I've tried both the 810 and the 7/8xx version of the scsi driver, and
<BR>
both have the same problem.  I forget the exact message, sorry.  This
<BR>
same kernel and modules is running on the other UDB (redhat) with no
<BR>
problems.
<BR>
<P>The differences between the machines are that the RH one has no internal
<BR>
hard drive, 6 devices on the external SCSI chain, and 72MB RAM.  The
<BR>
debian box has 48MB RAM and an internal hard drive.  The disk layouts
<BR>
are similar (both boot from ARC/MILO).  I have swapped the riser card
<BR>
with the SCSI chip but the same problems appear.  Sometimes the debian
<BR>
box prints &quot;ECC check: lca short ... correctable parity error&quot; but this
<BR>
RAM *used* to run in the RH box and these errors, although annoying,
<BR>
were benign.
<BR>
<P>The kernel is setup to do transparent proxy and port forwarding.  Right
<BR>
now it is sitting idle to see how long it can sit before hanging.  I was
<BR>
doing some heavy disk I/O without error today.  The only disk I/O when
<BR>
in &quot;production&quot; is rinetd logging, which can get heavy (as the gateway,
<BR>
port 80 is internally redirected to port 85, which rinetd listens on and
<BR>
forwards to another machine running the squid, unless it is squid making
<BR>
the request).
<BR>
<P>If the machine stays up for a week, I'll turn on the second interface
<BR>
and again wait.  If it stays up, I'll enable all the
<BR>
filtering/forwarding rules and see if it continues to function, which if
<BR>
history is any indication, it will not.
<BR>
<P>I'm really just out of ideas at this point and am wondering if 'the
<BR>
collective conciousness' might have some ideas of things to try, rather
<BR>
tahn wait a month and see if it crashes.
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
Christopher
