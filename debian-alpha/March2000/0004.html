<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Because we *need* to ship that version of MILO, I fear we'll have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; go back to my system of creating separate MILO/linload.exe images (we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; can of course make them significantly smaller than 1.4M :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If we can't tweak our kernels to fit we've got to go that road.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yeah - also see the bug I filed - we really should have the de4x5
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; driver compiled in.  Actually I notice that my 2.2.15pre12 kernels
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aren't terribly large (, and they might almost fit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm going back to the separate MILO disks (which are now 720k images,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since MILO is only 450k or so - it should work fine since FAT12 is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pretty dumb filesystem).  However, I've parameterized the set of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; architectures for which we build rescue disks - the &quot;small&quot; set is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generic and jensen (because it appears that the generic kernel has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some problems on Jensen).  If you want to build the full set, with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MILO on the rescue disks you can say:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make alpha_reduced_rescue_set=NO write_milo=YES build_milo_disks=NO
</EM><BR>
<P>OK.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By the way, it *is* necessary to install the System.map, otherwise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; procps and some other things complain at you.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, an explanation finally ;-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Is there anywhere a document on the current status of SRMs for the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; different subarchs ? Which platforms are still depending on MILOs ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;From what I've been told, XL is the only architecture that has no SRM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; available.  I've put a pointer to the firmware updates page on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Compaq's website in the install documentation.
</EM><BR>
<P>So what's the correct way to boot an XL into Linux ?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The cases where MILO is still useful are (and I guess this should go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the documentation) where the user:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a) is dual-booting with NT on a half-flash machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; b) is dual-booting with NT from a single disk on a full-flash machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; c) is reinstalling onto a DOS-partitioned disk with existing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; partitions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; d) has a half-flash machine and doesn't want to reflash their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; firmware (or has a full-flash machine and can't figure out how to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; switch to SRM from AlphaBIOS :)
</EM><BR>
<P>This should definitely go into the Alpha install docs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; One other thing to mention: if we are going to provide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; subarch-specific kernels (the only machine that really needs this in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; order to boot is Jensen), then we should also provide kernel disks for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; DP264 and Nautilus, particularly since I've added them to the list of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; subarchitectures in the documentation :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The 2.2.14 alpha images were built by myself because Herbert didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I guess the bug that I filed against them (the de4x5 driver isn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; built in - it really needs to be) goes to you then :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; build them for quite some time after the i386 release. DP264, Nautilus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and book1 didn't compile so we left them out. Like I said above
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ah, yeah, nautilus and dp264 both need some patches, which will be in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.2.15.  
</EM><BR>
<P>But potato will use 2.2.14 presumably.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But I would really rather go with the generic kernel only for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SRM boots (except on Jensen) because it saves a lot of space, and it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looks like we're telling people to recompile their kernel after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installing anyway.
</EM><BR>
<P>I always thought that we _don't_ want to urge them to produce their own
<BR>
kernels (the Debian kernels should work in most circumstances).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For woody I'd really like to do something like Red Hat does where it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; detects if your machine is SMP, except for alpha subarchitectures,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then installs the proper kernel after the initial boot (policy be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; damned :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Why don't we provide a generic-smp boot floppy set. Besides 2.2.14 already
<BR>
provides a smp kernel package so you got the chance to install it yourself
<BR>
after the initial installation.
<BR>

What's the railroad to me ?
I never go to see
Where it ends.
It fills a few hollows,
And makes banks for the swallows, 
It sets the sand a-blowing,
And the blackberries a-growing.
