<P>
I've got one of those junker UDB's and did an install last night.
<BR>
Overall it went really well and most of my issues were crappy hardware
<BR>
related.
<BR>
<P>- Learned that if your battery is bad it locks on loading the ARC
<BR>
console but if you remove it completely it boots into SRM (which is what
<BR>
I wanted anyways)
<BR>
- Installing kernel and modules kind of worked... it worked but it
<BR>
didn't increment to the next step
<BR>
- The tulip driver only got installed if I manually modprobe'd it myself
<BR>
or forced it via Configure Drivers
<BR>
- aboot didn't install... still not sure why (I left 4megs at the start
<BR>
of the disk for it)... but the rescue was easy enough
<BR>
- the default aboot.conf was setup really weird... I installed to sda1
<BR>
but it was setup to boot off of sda2
<BR>
- doing an swriteboot /dev/sda bootlx still didn't get me a device where
<BR>
I could 'boot dka0' but 'boot dka100' works so I'm assuming it's just my
<BR>
ignorance of aboot
<BR>
- dhcp/pump don't work... I'll probably do some debugging on this to see
<BR>
what I can do
<BR>
- Multia's are *not* Y2k complaint in any sense of the word. Setting the
<BR>
date in SRM yields 1980. After rebooting (even if the date was set in
<BR>
the hardware using hwclock) the date is read from the hardware as 2176.
<BR>
If I use hwclock to write it to the hardware and read it back (without
<BR>
rebooting) it is correct.
<BR>
- NTP is screwed too... I'll have to look into this too (escpecially
<BR>
since the Multia's clock is screwed). Executing ntpdate leads to some
<BR>
screwed up date in 2204.
<BR>
- I've figured out how to set the default when just 'boot' is executed
<BR>
in the SRM but I haven't figured out a way to get it to auto-boot to
<BR>
it... preferably with a delay before it's executed but I'd live with
<BR>
just automatically booting into it.
<BR>
<P>Anyways, thanks!
