Hi,
<BR>
<P>I've uploaded an official build of boot-floppies 2.2.8 for Alpha.  It
<BR>
won't actually show up in /debian/dists/potato/main/disks-alpha/ until
<BR>
it gets installed there by the release manager.
<BR>
<P>This is built with the &quot;reduced rescue&quot; option turned on, meaning that
<BR>
the only subarchitectures that actually have rescue and drivers images
<BR>
and tarballs are generic and jensen.  In the future this will include
<BR>
nautilus, since it's different from all the others. (Right now there's
<BR>
an APB directory in the tarball but it's empty until we have nautilus
<BR>
stuff... in fact I suspect there will be SRM firmware for the UP1000
<BR>
in the rather near future, seeing as the kernel support for it is in
<BR>
2.2.15pre :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From looking at the sheer volume of *stuff* that gets built if we go
</EM><BR>
with the full set of subarchitectures, it's obvious that we cannot do
<BR>
this for potato.  The full set is some 220 megabytes large - and a CD
<BR>
is only 650M!
<BR>
<P>In this upload, all the subarchitectures that use MILO have
<BR>
directories containing only a milo.bin disk.  I don't really think we
<BR>
gain anything from making MILO disks, so I'm probably going to remove
<BR>
those in 2.2.9 and update the documentation to say &quot;just make a FAT
<BR>
formatted floppy and put linload.exe and MILO on it&quot; - a lot of people
<BR>
will be booting from CD instead, and we need the &quot;loose&quot; MILO binaries
<BR>
for that anyway.
<BR>
<P>This also makes the directory layout a lot cleaner.  Since we don't
<BR>
have any disk sizes other than 1.4M on Alpha, in 2.2.9, I think I will
<BR>
remove the intervening images-1.44/ directories (all we need to do is
<BR>
make dbootstrap not default to looking in these directories on Alpha -
<BR>
Sparc may want to do this too), so it will look like:
<BR>
<P>/MILO
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(lots of MILO binaries)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;linload.exe
<BR>
/APB
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apb.exe
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up1000.pal
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(various documentation, from the API floppy)
<BR>
/linux (generic)
<BR>
/drivers.tgz (generic)
<BR>
/rescue.bin (generic)
<BR>
/root.bin (generic)
<BR>
/tftpboot.img (generic)
<BR>
(base disks)
<BR>
(generic drivers disks)
<BR>
/jensen/
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;linux
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drivers.tgz
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rescue.bin
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tftpboot.img
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(drivers disks)
<BR>
/nautilus/
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;linux
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drivers.tgz
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rescue.bin (including APB and PALCode, since it's small)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(drivers disks)
<BR>
<P>Comments welcome - just keep the disk space restrictions and the need
<BR>
for CD/Network installs to find the files in mind.
<BR>
<P>I'll also put Nikita's netbooting stuff in 2.2.9.
