<EM>&gt; &gt; The FAT formatted floppy:

<EM>&gt; That won't work, you can't &quot;copy&quot; the images to disk. You have to use dd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on a UNIX/Linux system or rawrite on a (yuck) DOS system.
</EM><BR>
<P>The reason I tried that is that root.bin is of size
<BR>
1,324,727 Bytes, which is not an integer multiple of
<BR>
block sizes usually used in dd writes. I expected
<BR>
floppy images to be of size 1440k (and I was wrong).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The unformatted floppy:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; dd if=root.bin of=/dev/fd0 bs=1024 conv=sync; sync
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hmm, that should have worked. I'd suspect bad floppies or bad images.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are right. Must have been a bad floppy, sorry.
<BR>
I started with two different floppies, to which I
<BR>
wrote root.bin using dd. I couldn't boot from either
<BR>
because I forgot the load_ramdisk=1 kernel option.
<BR>
<P>Then I reformatted one of these disks to FAT, leaving
<BR>
me a single (supposedly bad) ram disk created with dd.
<BR>
I now tried a third floppy (again using dd together
<BR>
with load_ramdisk=1) and it now works!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You should have 3 disks. One boot, one root, and a ramdisk. I don't ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remember having to format them prior to using dd, but I guess it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wouldn't hurt trying.
</EM><BR>
<P>Three disks? Well, I just bootet from two (not needing
<BR>
a Milo floppy). A rescue (or root) disk and a boot (or ram-)
<BR>
disk. I don't think I am missing something, am I?
<BR>
<P>Thanks again, Ron. You saved my Sunday evening.
