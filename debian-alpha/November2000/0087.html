<EM>&gt; I see... FWIW I also run ARC + milo on one of my Alphas (SRM doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like the video). Unless you are feeling daring, I'd say &quot;if it ain't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; broke, don't fix it.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Uh, video. Could be another reason for me not to switch to
<BR>
SRM. I still have a bootable NT installation on this machine,
<BR>
which can't hold both firmwares in ROM together.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I never tried booting directly from a CD in milo, SRM yes, but not milo.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Has anyone tried that recently?
</EM><BR>
<P>I thought &quot;just give it a try&quot; to avoid the need for boot
<BR>
floppies, but I must admit that I too never tried before to
<BR>
boot a CD directly from milo.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Did you get potato installed ok?
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;installed ok&quot; in the sense &quot;potato is now installed on and
<BR>
bootable from HD&quot;: yes. And that's pretty much all I expected
<BR>
when installing a distribution I'm new to. I will reinstall
<BR>
potato at least a second time to get more familiar to Debian's
<BR>
installaion procedure.
