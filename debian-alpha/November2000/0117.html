Hello again...
<BR>
<P>Ok, I drove over to my mom's house and ripped
<BR>
an S3ViRGE out her computer to test XF 4.0.1 with.
<BR>
So far, I've come to the conclusion that NONE of the
<BR>
modules should be stripped on Alpha (at least not in
<BR>
the common &quot;dh_strip&quot; way).  Also, there seems to be
<BR>
some issues with the DRAM refresh timing with this
<BR>
driver/card combo, BUT the good news is that I got it
<BR>
to work in 8-bit mode :-)
<BR>
<P>I'll be compiling the new XF packages probably tonight
<BR>
and will make sure to NOT strip any of the modules.
<BR>
I'm also going to attempt to enable Jensen support
<BR>
to &quot;see what happens&quot; (to help out our stranded XL
<BR>
user), but I'm not promising anything on that front
<BR>
yet.
<BR>
<P>I'll keep prodding at it, though, and see what I can
<BR>
fix with, at least, the s3virge driver for now.
<BR>
<P>In the meantime, I really really need feedback on these.
<BR>
I'm going to upload this next batch of debs and delete
<BR>
the compiled source tree within a day of the upload, so
<BR>
I'll need some fast testing and feedback.
<BR>
<P>FYI, my email is hosed, but I've temporarily reforwarded
<BR>
all of it to one of the debian machines, so my replies
<BR>
won't be as fast as normal.
<BR>
<P>C
<BR>
