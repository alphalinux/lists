Hi.


I compiled linux-2.4.0-test10 on SX164 (AlphaBIOS) running potato.

But booting this kernel failed. Please let me know hits to solve

the problem.


The procedure is like following. 


  # cd /usr/src/linux

  # make xconfig

  # make dep; make clean; make; make modules

  # make modules_install

  # make vmlinux

  # make boot


Then new kernel is made as /usr/src/linux/arch/alpha/boot/vmlinux.gz

Reboot the machine by `reboot` command and stop the procedure while

MILO waiting for few seconds. Next command is


  MILO> boot sda2:/usr/src/linux/arch/alpha/boot/vmlinux.gz root=/dev/sda2


Of corse, sda2 is the root partition. Then a line '-----------------'

which is showing the load of kernel appears. Just after that, the console

is cleard just like typing `clear` command on xterm and then MILO restarts

from the very beginning.


I selected both generic and SX164 as architecture setting of config

but in both case this problem appears.


I may be making stupid mistake. Please give me advices.


Thanks.
