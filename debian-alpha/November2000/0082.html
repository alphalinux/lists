<P><EM>&gt; The reason I tried that is that root.bin is of size
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1,324,727 Bytes, which is not an integer multiple of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; block sizes usually used in dd writes. I expected
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; floppy images to be of size 1440k (and I was wrong).
</EM><BR>
<P>The image doesn't have to fill the entire disk AFAIK. In fact I built
<BR>
some disks a month ago and they were only 1220K (they were for a
<BR>
firewall).  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You are right. Must have been a bad floppy, sorry.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I started with two different floppies, to which I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wrote root.bin using dd. I couldn't boot from either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because I forgot the load_ramdisk=1 kernel option.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then I reformatted one of these disks to FAT, leaving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me a single (supposedly bad) ram disk created with dd.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I now tried a third floppy (again using dd together
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with load_ramdisk=1) and it now works!
</EM><BR>
<P>Great! 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Three disks? Well, I just bootet from two (not needing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a Milo floppy). A rescue (or root) disk and a boot (or ram-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disk. I don't think I am missing something, am I?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, there should have been three disks:
<BR>
<P>boot: has milo and linload.exe
<BR>
root: has the kernel
<BR>
ramdisk: self explanatory
<BR>
<P>Did you perhaps use a kernel image off a CD and therefor removing the
<BR>
need for the root disk? Otherwise I don't see how you could have even
<BR>
got the kernel to load as ARC doesn't know how to load it on it's own. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Thanks again, Ron. You saved my Sunday evening.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are welcome, glad I could help!
