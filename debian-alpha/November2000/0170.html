<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, you could use ALSA (www.alsa-project.org).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Good point.  I hear ALSA support on the Live! cards is better anyway.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; FWIW, when we did the SBLive testing on UP1000 at API we used Alsa as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other kenrel module wasn't ready yet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
Hmm.. I know that quite a while ago, I was working with Rui Sousa from the
<BR>
emu10k1-devel list to get the Creative drivers working... they were working
<BR>
fine the last time I had a working Alpha (in between machines at the
<BR>
moment), but mixing them with Esound gave me grief (it played everything
<BR>
multiple times (each set of two seconds was repeated 3/4 times))..
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I think RH is going with 2.4.0-test7 or something like that (at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that's what I heard last).  It could be that they're using one of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 2.2.18pre's, though, since they do resemble the 2.4.0-test series more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; than they resemble 2.2.17 :-P
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 7.0 ships with a 2.2.17, there's a 2.4.0 on one of the CDs if you want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; play with it, but they don't install it for you.
</EM><BR>
<P>There's a preview directory (under i386) on disk 2 that has 2.4.0-test6 (or
<BR>
thereabouts. It also has devfsd and a few other bits and pieces (a different
<BR>
glibc build). I haven't seen the alpha version yet..

<P>L.
