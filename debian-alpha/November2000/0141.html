Ok, good news!
<BR>
<P>I just uploaded the new 4.0.1-5 debs to master.  Rich Payne reports that
<BR>
they now work on TNT boards in Alphas and I've confirmed that V3's work
<BR>
great too!
<BR>
<P>In other good news, I've figured out where the segfault is coming from
<BR>
when you run 'XFree86 -configure', but haven't discovered exactly why
<BR>
yet.  It turns out that the much maligned S3V (S3 ViRGE) driver has more
<BR>
problems that I thought and, when the configure pass tries to scan for
<BR>
ViRGE cards, it dies.  Simply removing the s3virge_drv.o module from
<BR>
/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/drivers seems to allow XFree86 -configure to
<BR>
complete successfully.  Note, I don't recommend doing this unless you're
<BR>
POSITIVE that you don't have a ViRGE installed in your system and, you
<BR>
guessed it, that driver will probably be installed again with the next
<BR>
revision (forcing you to rm it all over again if it's not fixed by then).
<BR>
<P>I'm going to look into this to find out what's going on.  I have quite a
<BR>
few logs sitting around, so it shouldn't be brutal to track down.
<BR>
<P>In the meantime, the dinstall run should have the new debs installed into
<BR>
master tomorrow at around 3pm EST, in case you want to go the apt
<BR>
path.  If you don't want to wait, you can fetch them at either

<P>Thanks!
