Hello world,
<BR>
<P>debian-cd folk: 2.2r1 is final, even if that'll make some of the powerpc
<BR>
and security folk (justifiably) unhappy. If you'd like to update the
<BR>
potato CD images, that'd probably be a good thing.
<BR>
<P>All who're interested: katie (ie, the new dinstall, ie package pools)
<BR>
will be rolled out when James has enough time to cope with any unforseen
<BR>
problems. Hopefully in the next week or two. &quot;testing&quot; will be rolled out
<BR>
shortly afterwards, in all probability.
<BR>
<P>debian-cd folk: when katie is rolled out, the debian-cd scripts will
<BR>
probably break [0], it'd be very helpful if this can be fixed ASAP,
<BR>
otherwise we won't be able to provide official CDs for 2.2r2...
<BR>
<P>Porters, X folks, etc: 2.2r2 is likely to come out relatively
<BR>
quickly. Please consider this as your notification, and upload any ports
<BR>
or security fixes or new versions that should make it into r2 sooner
<BR>
rather than later.
<BR>
<P>For those who're interested: we'll see about handling 2.2r2 in a more
<BR>
transparent manner. I'll try to keep auric:~ajt/which-updates as an up
<BR>
to date list of which will get accepted and why others will get rejected,
<BR>
and have it posted automatically to -release once a week. Comments etc
<BR>
should go to -release.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
aj
<BR>
<P>[0] Since the Packages files will start referencing packages and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sources in the pool, rather than under dists/potato/... This is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;actually unavoidable, but we'll try to make sure there are at
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;least symlinks from dists/potato to the pool for anything missing,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FWIW. The Packages/Sources files may or may not end up pointing at
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the symlinks rather than the pool. This will probably first happen
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sometime after the changeover, but will definitely happen during
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2r2.
<BR>
<P><PRE>

I don't speak for anyone save myself. GPG signed mail preferred.
