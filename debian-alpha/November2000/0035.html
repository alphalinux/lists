<P><EM>&gt; I am referring to /usr/bin/ldd, it did not have manpages. I was

<EM>&gt; confused, because there is as well a /usr/bin/ld.
</EM><BR>
<P>All that ldd does is print shared library dependencies.  The true dynamic
<BR>
linker is ld-linux.so.  Quite a few people get that confused, btw.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I found the error, I had a typo in the Makefile linker line. 
</EM><BR>
<P>That's good news :-)  Yes, frequently, you'll see those kinds of problems
<BR>
caused by Makefile errors or Tru64-isms (since most code assumes that, if
<BR>
you're compiling on Alpha, you're running Digital UNIX, or Tru64).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Thank you for your help. As soon as something struggles me or makes me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; curious, I will pester you with it! ;-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; BTW, what is the meaning of this -taso thing? Why is it necessary to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reorient a binary to a 32 bit space?
</EM><BR>
<P>Sometimes, it makes it easier to compile and run huge software projects
<BR>
that are written with 32-bit architectures in mind (the original Netscape
<BR>
code, for example).  The code will often do pointer arithmetic and other
<BR>
dangerous things because they make assumptions about pointer size and
<BR>
often the sizes of some of the standard types ('long' being the most
<BR>
frequently assumed type other than a pointer).  If the source code is so
<BR>
large that it would be tough or take too long to properly modify the code
<BR>
to work on 64-bit archs, many people would rather have the software
<BR>
compile as if it were on a 32-bit arch.  I, personally, think that the
<BR>
-taso flag is frequently used as an excuse not to do the work of porting
<BR>
properly, but for the beginner or non-programmer, it can at least
<BR>
sometimes give them a working binary.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But as you see, before trying to set up a cross compiler, I should first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; learn more about a standard compiler on a system.
</EM><BR>
<P>It helps, believe me.  I have a few cross-compilers installed on my system
<BR>
(mostly MIPS-related, since I have an Indy also).  Once you get used to
<BR>
working with one, you'll realise that it just seems difficult at first :-)
