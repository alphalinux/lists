<EM>&gt; Greetings,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have never used Debian before and I want to try it. Currently I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mandrake on my SX164 but I figured that 4GB ought to be enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for 2 OSes. I would be very grateful for any information about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; coexistance of Linuxes on Alpha
</EM><BR>
<P>Different Linux installations shouldn't result in
<BR>
problems per se --- as seen firmware-wise.
<BR>
<P>[Excuse my innocent posting, I'm still booting my
<BR>
&nbsp;two little Alphas via ARC/AlphaBios and do not
<BR>
&nbsp;have access to a SRM machine.]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; my search on dejanews and alphalinux.org hasn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; showed up anything so far.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe these issues you were looking for simply do
<BR>
not exist? I would be *very* surprised if SRM had
<BR>
such limitations.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That is, booting from SRM, are there any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problems to watch for when one wants to have 2 (apparently) different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slices to boot from, one swap and one common /home to share ?
</EM><BR>
<P>A single swap partition for all Linux installations?
<BR>
That's not a firmware issue. Can be done inside the
<BR>
Linuxes (ugly word, or not?) or chosen during install.
<BR>
<P>A single home partition? Keep in mind that different
<BR>
Linux distributions might be binary incompatible with
<BR>
each other, so if developers are out there in /home
<BR>
expect problems from this corner.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
