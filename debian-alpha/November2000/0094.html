<EM>&gt; But my machine isn't a Jensen!  It's an XL 266.  I have tried it with a

<EM>&gt; Matrox M200 and an S3 Virge, both give the same results.  The full log is

<P>Looks like I was right.  It seems that the XLs are not returning sparse
<BR>
and dense mem base addresses, like most post-Jensen Alphas.  It seems that
<BR>
there is some Jensen support code in the sources, but why it's not being
<BR>
compiled in yet is something I'm not sure of at this time.  I'll continue
<BR>
to look into this.  Again, obviously, since I'm the only one of the Debian
<BR>
folk that's even attempted to compile this on Alpha, we're definitely in
<BR>
new territory, so be patient :-)
<BR>
<P>I've got a ton of things to catch up on today (including a glibc
<BR>
compilation), so bear with me if I can't follow up on this right away.
