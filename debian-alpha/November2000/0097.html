<EM>&gt; &gt; Has anyone gotten XFree 4 to run on any of the XL machines?  I recently

<EM>&gt; &gt; If you are interesetd in fixing Jensen support

<EM>&gt; &gt; please contact xfree86@xfree86.org
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; But my machine isn't a Jensen!  It's an XL 266.  I have tried it with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Matrox M200 and an S3 Virge, both give the same results.  The full log is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; attached.  Any ideas would be appreciated.  Thanks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Looks like I was right.  It seems that the XLs are not returning sparse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and dense mem base addresses, like most post-Jensen Alphas.  It seems that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there is some Jensen support code in the sources, but why it's not being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compiled in yet is something I'm not sure of at this time.  I'll continue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to look into this.  Again, obviously, since I'm the only one of the Debian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; folk that's even attempted to compile this on Alpha, we're definitely in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; new territory, so be patient :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I tried stabbing into the XF code and found that it detected Jensen's by
<BR>
the _bus_base() function (Jensen-like machines return NULL it seems), but
<BR>
that's as far as I got (and my Alpha architecture knowledge is somewhat
<BR>
limited).  There definitely is a lack of XFree4 Alpha docs.  I appreciate
<BR>
anything you can find out about this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've got a ton of things to catch up on today (including a glibc
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compilation), so bear with me if I can't follow up on this right away.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Spending some quality time in console-land never hurt anyone :).  Thanks,
<BR>
again.
