<P>Andy, I'm assuming that you try to install Debian (potato
<BR>
or whatever) on an ARC-only machine, or do you fiddle with
<BR>
other bootable CDs?
<BR>
<P>To make it short: I finally succeeded installing potato on
<BR>
a PC164 using ARC firmware *floppyless*. Booting Linux
<BR>
without floppies after the installation has finished is
<BR>
no problem anyways (the ARC boot selection you have to
<BR>
create for installation can be used for booting after
<BR>
install with minor corrections).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm trying to get a CD booted directly from the ARC console on an Alpha XL
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 266. ARC requires a FAT formatted partition with a Windows-style
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; executable (IIRC) somewhere in it, this is how MILO boots Linux.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, yes and no. Booting via ARC requires a (small) FAT
<BR>
partition, to where you have to place linload.exe (this is
<BR>
not an AlphaNT executable, it's ARC-native) and milo (the
<BR>
right one for your machine, of course). At least if you
<BR>
want to avoid a floppy for that purpose alone.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2) the floppy controller on my machine doesn't work, so I MUST boot from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CD.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, no. I assume you have a hard disk in your machine. ;-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3) the potato CD images don't appear to have a MILO partition scheme
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; working.
</EM><BR>
<P>A FAT partition an a CD. Partitions on a CD? Well, I'm
<BR>
not an expert for this, but I assume that this is simply
<BR>
impossible to accomplish.
<BR>
<P>And that's the way it works:
<BR>
<P>You need two hard disk partitions to do an debian install
<BR>
on ARC based machines: The FAT partition already mentioned,
<BR>
which is recognised by ARC, to hold linload.exe and milo.
<BR>
And a (equally well small) ext2fs partition for ther kernel
<BR>
and the root image (which is recognised by milo and has
<BR>
not the restrictions of a FAT formatted partition).
<BR>
<P>Copy linload.exe and milo (again: the right one) to the
<BR>
FAT partition. That's the place you have to point ARC to,
<BR>
to find those files (usually by creating a new boot selection
<BR>
in ARC).
<BR>
<P>Copy the kernel image (&quot;linux&quot;) to the root directory of
<BR>
the ext2fs partition. Extract root.tar.gz into the same
<BR>
directory and move all files from debian-alpha-root dir
<BR>
to the root directory of this partition (leaving
<BR>
debian-alpha-root empty).
<BR>
<P>Now either choose to set OSLOADOPTIONS in your newly created
<BR>
ARC boot selection to `boot sdb8:/linux root=/dev/sdb8´
<BR>
(note that this is an example, I just used /dev/sdb8 as the
<BR>
ext2fs partition for that purpose) or to type this command
<BR>
directly at the milo prompt.
<BR>
<P>Good luck,
<BR>
