<EM>&gt; that's as far as I got (and my Alpha architecture knowledge is somewhat

<P>_bus_base() is, indeed, the function in question.  It does much more than
<BR>
just detect whether or not the machine in question is a Jensen,
<BR>
though.  For some reason, on the XL that you have, it's not returning the
<BR>
values that it should, unfortunately.  I'll see if I can write some code
<BR>
today to see what the return value of _bus_base() is on your
<BR>
machine.  I'll also dig into the glibc code a bit for more info (since the
<BR>
function is totally undocumented in the standard docs).
<BR>
<P>Do you have any technical docs on your XL, by any chance?  I think I have
<BR>
some, but I'm not sure yet...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Spending some quality time in console-land never hurt anyone :).  Thanks,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; again.
</EM><BR>
<P>No problem.  I'll work on that code right now.  With the glibc compilation
<BR>
out of the way now, I can work on this a bit while waiting for another
<BR>
test-compile of Qt churns.
