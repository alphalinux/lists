Get them while they're hot...get them while they're buttered :-P

<P>I think I have all of the known issues covered with this one.  I didn't
<BR>
strip ANYTHING in xserver-xfree86 package, so it's huge now, but it needed
<BR>
to be done since more and more modules were cropping up with symbol
<BR>
problems.  I'll investigate trying to narrow down the problematic modules
<BR>
so that I can shrink this down in the future by stripping the stuff that I
<BR>
know that we can strip safely.
<BR>
<P>I also enabled Jensen support for this one (or at least I'm hoping that my
<BR>
patch worked to do this).  If Ghandi could test this out for me, I'd
<BR>
appreciate it (should work on your system if the support code even halfway
<BR>
works).
<BR>
<P>I'm going to give this one a day before uploading it to master.  I know
<BR>
Rich Payne is going to test it on a V3 (thanks again for that) and I'm
<BR>
hoping Ghandi will try it on his XL, but I'd like a few more reports if
<BR>
possible.
<BR>
<P>If I don't hear of any big problems that I can easily correct, I'll upload
<BR>
the packages tomorrow morning and also submit my big diff to Branden with
<BR>
the Alpha changes.
<BR>
<P>Thanks!
