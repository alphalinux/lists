<P><EM>&gt; I've been trying to upgrade from Potato to Woody for a while now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have made the necessary changes to redirect apt-get to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; new distribution.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But when running &quot;apt-get update&quot;, it fails to find a file called
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Packages&quot; in the binary/alpha directory. A manually connect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the server and inspection of said directory shows that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; file _is_ there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have tried this now for several months, first thinking that it was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something wrong with the file and that it would be updated in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time. I have also tried different mirrors, but all with the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; result.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would appreciate some guidance.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure!  Please forward your /etc/apt/sources.list file to me so that I can
<BR>
see what's going wrong.  It could be that the mirrors that you've tried
<BR>
don't carry the other archs' unstable dirs.
