<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Fixed...it was an optimiser bug, as I had suspected.  I'm uploading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the binary NMU now to woody.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So what package sould i be looking to update?
</EM><BR>
<P>libgtk1.2
<BR>
<P>As an aside, dist-upgrade from slink (long ago) and more recently to
<BR>
woody had left behind libgtk1 and libgtk1.1 with no packages dependent
<BR>
on them.  You might want to remove them (as I did).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Does potato have the same problem?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mine did.  Like i had mentioned earlier, this problem had been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evident since i've used debian, which is about 18 months
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, same here.  I've been seeing this problem for a long time.  It
<BR>
was only when I wanted to try out Balsa (email) recently and it
<BR>
exhibited the same problem that I decided to go after it.  With luck a
<BR>
new gcc will allow us to re-enable optimization.
