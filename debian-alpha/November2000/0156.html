</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2. DRI, and agpgart support for my Matrox g400
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3. USB *stable* support
</EM><BR>
<P>I can understand this.  I know that API has tested USB support

successfully under 2.4.0-test kernels, but I'm not sure if they were using

the Adaptec driver or if they had installed another SCSI adapter and used

that instead.  I'll ask...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm not willing nor experienced enough to try something like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this.  I'll just keep trying until one of the kernels works.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hehehehe...ok.  I'll see if I can look at the driver source in the next
<BR>
few days to see if I notice anything obvious...
