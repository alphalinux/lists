<P><EM>&gt; There are a couple of bugs open about svgalib not building on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alpha.  I'm mostly asking for advice here; I could just set
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Architecture: i386 and have done with it, but if it's possible to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it to build, that is clearly ideal!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I did try, some time ago, but with no understanding of anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; involved, it didn't go too well!  Is there anybody on this list who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might be able to have a look at this for me, or shall I just stop it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even trying?

<EM>&gt; At the time it came up last, Christopher Chimelis reckoned that it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be a difficult job with the sources in the state they were at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that point, but I don't know how that differs from their current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; state.  If forced to guess, I would say they are probably worse! ;-)

<P>Ironically, I was *just* looking into getting this working again
<BR>
(literally...this morning, in fact).  I believe upstream is thinking of
<BR>
dropping Alpha support, unfortunately.  I *might* be able to hack up some
<BR>
patches to it that maintains the current code status (meaning, a different
<BR>
deb will be needed for each alpha system family type...which is bad).  I'd
<BR>
much rather look into some patches that I just dug up that try to make
<BR>
SVGAlib more subtype-independent on Alpha, though.
<BR>
<P>In short, I'll look into it after I do today's woody compiles and fix gts
<BR>
once and for all (meaning today).
