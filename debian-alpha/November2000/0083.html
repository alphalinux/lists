<EM>&gt; Yeah, there should have been three disks:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boot: has milo and linload.exe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; root: has the kernel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ramdisk: self explanatory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Did you perhaps use a kernel image off a CD and therefor removing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need for the root disk? Otherwise I don't see how you could have even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; got the kernel to load as ARC doesn't know how to load it on it's own.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I simply have a copy of milo and linload.exe
<BR>
(those files from the potato CD, of course) on a small
<BR>
FAT partition somewhere on a HD. That's where I point
<BR>
ARC to. I prefer to do further experiments from then
<BR>
on via the Milo prompt (not having switched to SRM).
<BR>
<P>So for me: boot disk = root disk   --- floppy-wise
<BR>
<P>And yes, I did try to boot the kernel image directly
<BR>
from CD in this environment. But with no luck so far.
<BR>
Fails with that &quot;No init found&quot; kernel panic.
<BR>
Could be (in this respect) a faulty CD on my side,
<BR>
but I'm not sure about this.
