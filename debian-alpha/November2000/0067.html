<EM>&gt; So far I have the new debs working simply by commenting out the GLcore and glx modules in XFConfig-4.  As we all know this is a temporary measure.

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; I have seen Chris' post about his upload of these modules, but I haven't had the chance to play with these yet.

<EM>&gt; My question is: has anyone had any success with the Matrox drivers for xf4?  Their website says the beta release is only for i386, but since the source is available, I thought someone had played with these.  I would love to get xinerama working on my g400 card, since i've had a spare monitor just begging to be used for months now.

<P>The source is there...but it links to a binary only library! There's been
<BR>
some work with Matrox and I think somebody is in the process of porting
<BR>
that library to Alpha. Matrox is claiming that they can't release the
<BR>
source to that library....using the usualy reasons (intellectual property,
<BR>
some parts belong to others...the dog ate my homework).
<BR>
<P>So there is some hope.
