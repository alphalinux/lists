<EM>&gt; Does anybody know what the status of our compiler is?  Is there an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; upgrade available?  If so, can somebody please upload it?  If not,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what can I do to help report these errors -- what info is needed, etc?
</EM><BR>
<P>It's ugly to report the errors, but well worth the effort.  The few that
<BR>
I've managed to narrow down have been fixed already, but there are MANY
<BR>
more optimiser errors in egcs than I thought initially (or they may all be
<BR>
related).
<BR>
<P>To &quot;properly&quot; send the bug report to the egcs team, it's always wise to
<BR>
try to nail down which compiler option EXACTLY is causing the difficulty.
<BR>
The only way that I know is to try each option that -O2 includes
<BR>
seperately and together (there's a list in the info files, fyi...I also
<BR>
have a chart somewhere).  Believe me, they REALLY appreciate that.
<BR>
<P>The easy way out, though, is to send a preprocessed file to the egcs bug
<BR>
list (see egcs page at <A HREF="http://egcs.cygnus.com">http://egcs.cygnus.com</A> for more info on the rest of
<BR>
the contents of the message).
<BR>
<P>If you could start reporting these on a larger scale than I've been able
<BR>
to, I know more than a few of us would greatly appreciate it :-)
