<P>
I've been running the &quot;stable&quot; Debian/Alpha version for a while now, with
<BR>
very good success.
<BR>
<P>I then made the seeming mistake of figuring that since:
<BR>
a) Alpha &quot;stable&quot; has been working out very well, and
<BR>
b) I've got a box running bleeding-edge Debian/IA-32 that has been working
<BR>
out reasonably successfully, 
<BR>
it might be a nifty idea to move up to &quot;potato,&quot; and thereby get fresher
<BR>
libs, and, more notably, a fresher X server.
<BR>
<P>I &quot;apt-get&quot;-downloaded the updated packages last night, and then went
<BR>
through the bits of manual contortion (ar, and manually invoking
<BR>
installation scripts) so as to get libc 6.1, apt 0.3.4, and libc++, which
<BR>
permitted clean installation of the remainder of the upgraded packages.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, this seems to *severely* break the X server.
<BR>
<P>Two severe symptoms:
<BR>
a) It periodically &quot;blanks out,&quot; with things reappearing as soon as I press
<BR>
a key.
<BR>
b) X server often doesn't seem to want to stay running for more than moments.
<BR>
c) Probably related to b, I get an XDM session going, and programs (Gnome,
<BR>
WindowMaker, Emacs) start running, but then things stop cold, as the
<BR>
connection to XDM on remote box gets lost.  The X server reports:
<BR>
&quot;XDM: too many keepalive transmissions, declaring session died.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Does this mean that 3.3.3.1 may be &quot;not ready for prime time&quot;?  Have others
<BR>
hit this sort of thing?  Is this some sort of Multia-related flakiness?
<BR>
<P>Do I perhaps need to do some aggressive tuning of /etc/X11/XF86Config?
<BR>
That's not been needed before; the only tuning of the output of xf86config
<BR>
that I've normally needed has been to pick favored mode information...
<BR>
