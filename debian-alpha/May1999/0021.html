<P>
Not complaints just observations:
<BR>
<P>I finally got what looks like an installation completed on an alpha pc 
<BR>
164 lx.  Here are some stumbling blocks I faced.
<BR>
<P>1.  Rawrite on an NT system pruduced unreliable disks.  It seemed to
<BR>
create the rescue disk properly, but it made several unusable root
<BR>
disks.
<BR>
<P>2.  I could not make a driver/module disk that would load without an
<BR>
error.  Oddly it seemed to work but I kept getting a barely readable
<BR>
message in the background about how the file system was wrong.  I was
<BR>
also unable to configure any modules which I needed to do to get the
<BR>
ethernet working.  From the shell I did an insmod to load the
<BR>
appropriate module -- which worked.
<BR>
<P>3.  nsf: I was able to do an nsf mount to get the base system;
<BR>
however, I again got one of those messages blips that &quot;nsf module
<BR>
couldn't be found&quot;.
<BR>
<P>4. Reboot.  Got hung up when I entered the root password, had to power 
<BR>
cycyle.  The second reboot worked and logged in root automaticly.
<BR>
Also I missed out on picking the configuration.
<BR>
<P>5. dselect: For the install I got some depedency conflicts that didn't 
<BR>
make sense.  I had to delete a couple of packages that I figured I
<BR>
could live without.  I think loadmeter was one of them.
<BR>
<P>Apt is busy downloading packages as I write.
<BR>
<P>Obviously I was kind of in a hurry to get redhat off, and I could have 
<BR>
documented a little better.  I have another system to install based on 
<BR>
the same motherboard but from a different vendor.  I suppose I could
<BR>
take some better notes if anyone is interested.
<BR>
