<P>
I have tried to get the on-board sound card working in my alphastation 255.
<BR>
It is a Microsoft Sound system with an 1854 codec chip (that's the number on
<BR>
the chips at any rate).  Looking through the kernel and OSS sources, the only
<BR>
codec chips that it looks as though that are supported are the 1816 and the
<BR>
1848 chips.
<BR>
<P>Something that makes me think something's wrong, is when the SRM console is
<BR>
booting, it says &quot;no sound card in isa config table not configuring, even when
<BR>
specified explicitly with iconfig.  It then shows up with &gt;&gt;&gt; iscfg -slot 1 
<BR>
<P>i compiled the sound support directly into the kernel, and the sound subset
<BR>
said &quot;Microsoft Sound system&quot; but there was also a Compaq XL soundcard detected
<BR>
and that was what was set to default, even though I had not specified that
<BR>
anywhere in the configs.  I then tried installing it as modules.  They
<BR>
compiled ok, insmod'd okay, but `cat /proc/sound` gave no devices being active.
<BR>
/dev/sndstat also gave a lack of anything being present.
<BR>
<P>does anyone have any ideas?
