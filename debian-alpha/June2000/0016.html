<P>In my unprofessional opinion, I would say that it should be increased.

Under any load openldap might as well not work with this as a problem.
<BR>
There was a stable release on 5/15 and this bug has been around for longer
<BR>
then that, so it seems as if it has be disregarded.  I'm not sure how this
<BR>
works when the problem seems to be upstream though.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Don't bother tracking this, as I've already submitted a patch.  In the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; future, the attached program (which gives you a shell from which any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; programs you run will die with SIGBUS immediately on unaligned traps)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should prove useful.  (that is, if Gnus decides not to eat the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attachment :P)
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure what release of 1.2.10 the patch was created from, but it
<BR>
doesn't seem to apply to the latest stable or release, so I have not been
<BR>
able to test it.  This leaves me in kind of an awkward position. =P
<BR>
Suggestions?
