<EM>&gt;&gt; Anyway, in the course of messing about with this, I thought I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; take a look at the milo source. However, debian does not appear to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; provide the source code! This is very bizarre considering that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I wondered when someone was going to notice that.  The problem is, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;build the 2.0.35 MILO (which we use, because it actually works), you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have to build a 2.0.35 kernel for every single subarchitecture then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;relink MILO with it.  So it's a rather involved process.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes; this is why I was hoping somebody else had done a source pkg :-&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The 2.2 MILO is easier to build since it uses a generic kernel.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However all of the binaries I have tried have simply not worked on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Miata (probably because of the IDE code in the kernel, but I'm not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sure) and there have been problems with other models too I think.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, didn't work on my LX164 (went nowhere at all), although the
<BR>
MILO image was rather smaller than the 2.0 one so I was suspicious
<BR>
of that...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;There are some other problems with MILO.  In particular, the only VGA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;console code that seems to work is based on a non-free 8086 emulator
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from DEC.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So you see why Compaq is rather eager to deprecate MILO.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm. I'm using MILO because when I used SRM I ran into a PALcode
<BR>
exception problem which somebody suggested was due to a 
<BR>
hardware bug/interaction with SRM's palcode. Also, I'd much
<BR>
rather use PALcode for which I have the source...
<BR>
Any chance of Compaq giving us the SRM console source? :-&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I am basically providing MILO in the boot-floppies as a courtesy to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people who have existing MILO-based installations.  I do not use MILO
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and don't have the time to invest in fixing either the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;no-source-package problem or the bugs in its filesystem code that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cause problems for the installation process.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Other people are certainly welcome to contribute, though, and you have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the source: <A HREF="ftp://genie.ucd.ie/pub/alpha/milo/milo-2.0.35-c7b.tar.gz">ftp://genie.ucd.ie/pub/alpha/milo/milo-2.0.35-c7b.tar.gz</A>
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe I'll get round to doing something at some point :-&gt;
