Hi,
<BR>
<P>my computer is still 2 hours too early. I know this problem has been
<BR>
discussed before. It was mentioned, that one should change the setting
<BR>
in /etc/default/rcS from UTC=no to UTC=yes. I did this, but it did not
<BR>
have any effect at all.  Since I still need RedHat for work until the
<BR>
Debian install is completed, I would anyway prefer having the system set
<BR>
to local time.  When changing the time manually in the BIOS setup,
<BR>
Debian changes system time as well, but it is always 2 hours ahead. 
<BR>
<P>After finding this hwclock command, I had a look in its manpages and
<BR>
tried this:
<BR>
<P>alphons:/etc/default# hwclock --show
<BR>
Sun Jun  4 21:12:55 2000  -0.961548 seconds
<BR>
<P>And this is obscure! Here in Cologne it is now 7:12 pm. It cannot read
<BR>
the BIOS clock properly.
<BR>
<P>I tried the debug option and this is the output:
<BR>
<P>alphons:/etc/default# hwclock --debug --show
<BR>
we have read epoch 1980 from /dev/rtc with RTC_EPOCH_READ ioctl.
<BR>
funky TOY!
<BR>
hwclock 2.4c/util-linux-2.10f
<BR>
Using /dev/rtc interface to clock.
<BR>
Last drift adjustment done at 959521188 seconds after 1969
<BR>
Last calibration done at 959521188 seconds after 1969
<BR>
Hardware clock is on UTC time
<BR>
Assuming hardware clock is kept in UTC time.
<BR>
Waiting for clock tick...
<BR>
/dev/rtc does not have interrupt functions. Waiting in loop for time
<BR>
from /dev/rtc to change
<BR>
...got clock tick
<BR>
Time read from Hardware Clock: 19:27:41
<BR>
Hw clock time : 100/06/04 19:27:41 = 960146861 seconds since 1969
<BR>
Sun Jun  4 21:27:41 2000  -0.362794 seconds
<BR>
<P>My alphons seems to be one of those Alphas mentioned in the manpages
<BR>
where the hwclock program is mislead by whatever. Alphons is an LX164
<BR>
with AlphaBIOS 5.66. Is it correct to use the funky toy option for it or
<BR>
might the problem be, that it cannot find any interrupt functions?
<BR>
The BIOS is set to the proper time, under RedHat it is displayed
<BR>
correctly and booting RedHat after Debian does not do any harm to the
<BR>
time setting in RedHat (Since I did not install RedHat on alphons, I
<BR>
have no idea whether the people, I got the computer from, did use some
<BR>
kind of trick. I just can say that it does not change properly from
<BR>
winter to summer time and vice versa. I have to remember doing this by
<BR>
myself.)
<BR>
<P>What's the trick here?
<BR>
<P><P>Thanks in advance,
<BR>
<P>regards,
<BR>
<P>Kerstin
