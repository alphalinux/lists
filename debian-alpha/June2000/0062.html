<P>
&nbsp;I've just reinstalled debian on my lx164, this time booting
<BR>
from the srm console to milo. This appears to work, although
<BR>
I had to create a tiny DOS partition for milo to read the kernel
<BR>
from, as it claimed my ext2 partition didn't have any files in it.
<BR>
( I'm pretty sure I asked the install process to create a file system
<BR>
readable by older kernels)
<BR>
<P>Anyway, in the course of messing about with this, I thought I'd
<BR>
take a look at the milo source. However, debian does not appear to
<BR>
provide the source code! This is very bizarre considering that
<BR>
we ship binaries as part of boot floppies...
<BR>
(the boot floppies source just provides a pointer to genie.ucd.ie,
<BR>
which does not appear to provide source code, although possibly
<BR>
I just missed it...)
<BR>
<P>One of the things I really like about debian is that it is very easy 
<BR>
to get the source code for any package, examine it and change it and 
<BR>
then rebuild the package. It would be great if this was the case for 
<BR>
milo as well.
