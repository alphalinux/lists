Hi!
<BR>
<P>I decided to test a 2.2 installation on a Multia, and I think
<BR>
I found some pitfalls in the process:
<BR>
<P>First, the hardware details:
<BR>
SCSI disk, 230MB SCSI-MO, SCSI-cdrom, 96MB RAM, 166Mhz CPU
<BR>
<P>After making the boot floppies, I tried booting from SRM. I was
<BR>
booting from ARC before, so this was new for me: SRM barfed
<BR>
right from the start with some kind of hardware failure and
<BR>
a stack trace - ugh! The machine was booting fine before, though.
<BR>
<P>It turned out bad/old firmware which doesn't grok the MO. After
<BR>
I turned it off, I got a prompt. Well, I decided not to upgrade
<BR>
the firmware and switched back to ARC booting, which was working
<BR>
fine as before. I think 6.8 from the installation manual is
<BR>
a bit too short:
<BR>
<P>6.8. Booting from the ARC or AlphaBIOS Console
<BR>
----------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the OS Selection menu, set `linload.exe' as the boot loader, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`milo' as the OS Path.  Bootstrap using the newly created entry.
<BR>
<P>There should be another pointer to the MILO-howto, or even the
<BR>
old description which was taken out of it, IMHO.
<BR>
<P>Afterwards, all went well until the mke2fs run (I decided to start
<BR>
from scratch), I choosed to use the non-compilant filesystem (*)
<BR>
and was unable to boot from that filesystem, because MILO (the old
<BR>
one and the one from 2.2) couldn't read the new filesystem.
<BR>
This weren't that bad, if I had known a way back! I was siting there,
<BR>
with a perfect running system which couldn't boot up from it's own
<BR>
root filesystem, which was mounting well.
<BR>
<P>I failed miserably to get mke2fs to write a 2.0.x compilant filesystem
<BR>
manually, because I didn't found the right option - I really don't
<BR>
know what I should have done at this point.
<BR>
<P>I ended up writing the filesytem with an old debian installation
<BR>
disk, used that filesystem as it was, and all was well. I know
<BR>
that an installation on Alpha is harder than on i386, and that
<BR>
the UDB is obsolete as hell, but at (*) there should be warning
<BR>
for MILO users, IMHO.
<BR>
<P>HTH,
<BR>
Uli
