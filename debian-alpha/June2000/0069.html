<P><EM>&gt; Anyway, in the course of messing about with this, I thought I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take a look at the milo source. However, debian does not appear to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; provide the source code! This is very bizarre considering that
</EM><BR>
<P>I wondered when someone was going to notice that.  The problem is, to
<BR>
build the 2.0.35 MILO (which we use, because it actually works), you
<BR>
have to build a 2.0.35 kernel for every single subarchitecture then
<BR>
relink MILO with it.  So it's a rather involved process.
<BR>
<P>The 2.2 MILO is easier to build since it uses a generic kernel.
<BR>
However all of the binaries I have tried have simply not worked on
<BR>
Miata (probably because of the IDE code in the kernel, but I'm not
<BR>
sure) and there have been problems with other models too I think.
<BR>
<P>There are some other problems with MILO.  In particular, the only VGA
<BR>
console code that seems to work is based on a non-free 8086 emulator
<BR>
from DEC.
<BR>
<P>So you see why Compaq is rather eager to deprecate MILO.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; to get the source code for any package, examine it and change it and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then rebuild the package. It would be great if this was the case for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; milo as well.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's certainly not impossible to make a source package for MILO.  It
<BR>
should be possible to have one that works similarly to the
<BR>
kernel-image-foo-alpha source package.  Quite simply, nobody has
<BR>
gotten around to doing it.
<BR>
<P>I am basically providing MILO in the boot-floppies as a courtesy to
<BR>
people who have existing MILO-based installations.  I do not use MILO
<BR>
and don't have the time to invest in fixing either the
<BR>
no-source-package problem or the bugs in its filesystem code that
<BR>
cause problems for the installation process.
<BR>
<P>Other people are certainly welcome to contribute, though, and you have
<BR>
