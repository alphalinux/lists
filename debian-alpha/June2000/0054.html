<P><EM>&gt; Afterwards, all went well until the mke2fs run (I decided to start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from scratch), I choosed to use the non-compilant filesystem (*)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and was unable to boot from that filesystem, because MILO (the old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one and the one from 2.2) couldn't read the new filesystem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This weren't that bad, if I had known a way back! I was siting there,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with a perfect running system which couldn't boot up from it's own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; root filesystem, which was mounting well.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I failed miserably to get mke2fs to write a 2.0.x compilant filesystem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manually, because I didn't found the right option - I really don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know what I should have done at this point.
</EM><BR>
<P>mke2fs -O none -b 1024
<BR>
<P>The '-b 1024' is essential if you have a fairly large disk.
<BR>
<P>Somebody should really fix the ext2 code in MILO...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I ended up writing the filesytem with an old debian installation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disk, used that filesystem as it was, and all was well. I know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that an installation on Alpha is harder than on i386, and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the UDB is obsolete as hell, but at (*) there should be warning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for MILO users, IMHO.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, the intent was that dbootstrap would just not give you the
<BR>
option to make a non-compliant filesystem, and I kind of thought that
<BR>
I had tested this code and made sure it did that.  But the code that
<BR>
is supposed to do this looks fairly obviously wrong to me.  I'm not
<BR>
sure if this is my fault or a case of boot-floppies developers who
<BR>
don't know C very well messing it up where it worked before.
<BR>
<P>I'll try to get around to fixing it this week and I will put up a test
<BR>
version for MILO users when I do so.
