ok, I've got a solution here...
<BR>
revert back to the old fugly way of doing it. It takes the pointers out of
<BR>
the menu stuff and sticks them elsewhere which would allow this to work
<BR>
correctly. although I don't like doing this, at least I can inflict
<BR>
bluefish on alphas now ;)

<EM>&gt; &gt; eek, that would be one hell of a compiler bug...

<EM>&gt; Actually, upon further review, it seems I'm wrong again (geez, big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shock...I seem to be wrong alot today).  It's not the compiler
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; misinterpreting at all.  It seems that it just doesn't like the cast (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for good reason....it shouldn't work at all according to standards).  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; substituted an integer for the quote (I used 999) and it worked fine.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also removed the ampersand from another line and got the same error that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it was throwing before.  In short, until the menus are implemented more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; properly, I don't think we'll ever get this compiled on Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; GTK most definitely is a magic box. put stuff in, different stuff comes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; out and it worked somehow.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I guess now's the time to figure out how it worked :-)  It seems that some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; back-end assumptions were being made on the i386-compiled code, but the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha compiler must be more picky about making such assumptions.  Either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that or the GTK code itself somehow behaves slightly differently on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certain archs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Well, I was actually planning on getting one as my next computer, not sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; where I'm gonna get the cash though.. heh
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They're not bad if you get them on eBay.  I built a nice 164SX 533MHz
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machine for a hair over $500 (I did have a nice SCSI hard drive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already,though, which saved me some $$$).
