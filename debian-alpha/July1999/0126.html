<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I would like to use it as a diskless X server running Slink, with

<EM>&gt; &gt; it's root filesystem nfs-mounted from an i386, also running Slink.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I still have a few questions on this setup.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; - Although most of my installation experience is with Debian i386, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; don't think it's possible to use the Debian installer on a system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; without a harddisk, but I am not sure.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If I really have to, I could temporarily install a disk, but I want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; avoid that if possible.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; You will need a harddisk, but you don't have to write to it. You will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need a partition wich has type linux, which you can mount as root. But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before actually installing you can umount it and remount a nfs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; partition. Its a bit tricky, but it can be done. I did it on an i386
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some time ago. Maybe the installation routin could be changed to allow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nfs mounts for root with a few lines of code instead of insisting on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; locally mounted root partition.
</EM><BR>
<P>Strange, because a harddisk isn't needed to run Debian. Before my
<BR>
attempts with this Multia, I already tried to install Slink on a
<BR>
notebook with a broken harddisk. Even using a ramdisk wouldn't help.
<BR>
<P>I think it's a nice feature to have, a more generic idea of a &quot;disk&quot; in
<BR>
the Debian installation system. Who knows what other devices users want
<BR>
to install Debian on. Even /dev/ram? would have helped me.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; If you have a spare disk, and even if its only a zip disk, use that as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; root to install the base filesystem and then transfer it to the nfs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; server. Its faster to unscrew the Multia and stick in a disk than to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work around the installation routine.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, then I'll need to do that. Well, I happen to have a raid5 array that
<BR>
can miss a disk :)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; - Because both systems are Debian systems, it may be possible to merge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; certain architecture independent trees (like /usr/doc), but doesn't that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; break the Debian package system (what if I dpkg -r a package on one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; system, but want to keep it on the other ??)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You can merge them, but for installation purposes all systems need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; write permissions to that partition. Removing a package on just one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maschine means that you have to reinstall it on another maschine to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get the deleted files back. Maybe you can use libtricks to fake the rm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; calls.
</EM><BR>
<P>I already thought that would be problematic, but why does the Linux
<BR>
filesystem standards say that directories like /usr/share can be shared
<BR>
between different architectures, but using the .deb system breaks that.
<BR>
Does this mean that the .deb system needs to be modified to be FHS
<BR>
compliant ??
<BR>
<P>Tot ziens,
<BR>
