<P>
The following message is a courtesy copy of an article
<BR>
that has been posted to comp.os.linux.alpha as well.
<BR>
<P><P>Below is a response I received from the Compaq code developers at
<BR>
University of New Hampshire who are working on the port of the
<BR>
FORTRAN/C compilers to Linux Alpha.  For my particular applications, I
<BR>
will need to be able to utilize the floating point compiler options.
<BR>
Otherwise, pprobably man-years of effort would be required to code
<BR>
around the floating-point overflows, etc., &quot;built-in&quot; to the
<BR>
very-large application.  Although this is the best option, I do not
<BR>
have the time and/or money to do that now.
<BR>
<P>I would imagine there are lots of Linux Alpha folks with similar
<BR>
issues.  Speed is nice to have, but for porting large, legacy FORTRAN
<BR>
code, you also need these floating point options.  Note other Unix
<BR>
compilers, such as AIX xlf, IRIX f77, etc., also have floating-point
<BR>
options such as these.  Also, note that g77 on the Intel platform
<BR>
allows for these floating-point occurances by default.  Also, the
<BR>
-mieee option with g77 on the Alpha allows for *SOME*, but not all, of
<BR>
these options, but greatly reduces the efficiency of the Alpha chip in
<BR>
doing so.
<BR>
<P>According to the response below, the problem is within Linux, and not
<BR>
their compilers.  Could some of the Linux Alpha developers possibly
<BR>
get involved and help?  Are these developers the best that can be
<BR>
obtained to solve this problem?  It is certainly out of my league!
<BR>

<P>Hello,
<BR>
Thanks for the question. To answer your question, compaq is still looking
<BR>
into the problem of handling floating point exception. It is because linux
<BR>
does not have a robust floating point exception handler compared to UNIX.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Compaq is as  of now in no position to promise any other support than
<BR>
-fpe0 and -fpe3 options. The README file that is installed also says
<BR>
th same.

Brief Problem Description = nonsupported 
<BR>
Architecture = all
<BR>
Operating System = Linux
<BR>
Compiler Information = fort
<BR>
Libraries Used = n/a
<BR>
Other Information = It is this restriction that really causes the problems:
<BR>
<P>Please note that CFAL does not contain certain features that
<BR>
are available in DIGITAL Fortran 90 on Tru64 UNIX Alpha:
<BR>
<P>~  floating-point exception handling levels 1, 2, and 4
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and &quot;-check underflow&quot; are not supported
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
Problem Category = Compiler Installation
<BR>
<P>Detailed Description = I have a FORTRAN application used under
<BR>
DEC-Unix 4.0B that I currently run.  It requires the FORTRAN -fpe1
<BR>
option (and similar options or by default on other computer / OSs
<BR>
). Without this capability, I cannot even start to beta test the new
<BR>
compiler (for what I need!)
<BR>
<P>When will this capability be offered?
<BR>
