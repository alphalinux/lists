I downloaded the compaq fortran compilers a couple weeks ago when they
<BR>
were only available in rpm format.  I attempted to install using alien,
<BR>
but ran into serious dependency problems, so I bailed.  I checked again
<BR>
today and I found that they had put debian packages on their ftp site
<BR>
which I promptly downloaded (I really need these compilers).  Upon trying
<BR>
to install them I ran into a dependency problem that seemed less than
<BR>
trivial to me.  I am running slink, which uses libc6.1 version
<BR>
2.0.7.something and the compilers require version 2.1.  I noticed that
<BR>
potato contains libc6.1 version 2.1, but needless to say dpkg spit that
<BR>
one out when I tried to install it on my slink based system.  I'm a bit
<BR>
afraid to just try to grab the source and install the new library because
<BR>
I have heard nightmare stories about people who have done that and then
<BR>
their entire system did not work.  Could someone suggest a course of
<BR>
action?  Do I need to install potato?
