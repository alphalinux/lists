<EM>&gt; &gt; You will need a harddisk, but you don't have to write to it. You will

<BR>
<EM>&gt; Strange, because a harddisk isn't needed to run Debian. Before my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attempts with this Multia, I already tried to install Slink on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; notebook with a broken harddisk. Even using a ramdisk wouldn't help.
</EM><BR>
<P>The installscript won't let you install, unless you have a partition
<BR>
of type linux mounted at /target and mounted by the install
<BR>
script. Once you have that you can select &quot;install drivers&quot; and
<BR>
remount a nfs drive before telling the installscript where to get the
<BR>
driver and rescue disk from. Same for installing base. You need a
<BR>
harddisk to make the script happy. You actually never have to write
<BR>
anything to it.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I think it's a nice feature to have, a more generic idea of a &quot;disk&quot; in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Debian installation system. Who knows what other devices users want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to install Debian on. Even /dev/ram? would have helped me.
</EM><BR>
<P>Have a look at the script. If you erase the parts that test for a
<BR>
valid root partition and replace them with more flexible once, you can 
<BR>
easily install on /dev/ram. Of cause you need to recompile your kernel 
<BR>
with a bigger ramdisk or give the boot parameter for it.
<BR>
<P>I had a linux in a 32 MB ramdisk including X, which I could boot via
<BR>
bootdisk on the universities NT systems (using dosntfs and
<BR>
c:\temp\ramdisk :).
<BR>
...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; OK, then I'll need to do that. Well, I happen to have a raid5 array that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can miss a disk :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, oh. Just when you formated the drive, another one from the raid
<BR>
will fail :) Murphys law.
<BR>
...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I already thought that would be problematic, but why does the Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; filesystem standards say that directories like /usr/share can be shared
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; between different architectures, but using the .deb system breaks that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Does this mean that the .deb system needs to be modified to be FHS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compliant ??
</EM><BR>
<P>Write a bug (and a fix) for dpkg to be fhs compliant. I have usr
<BR>
shared for several systems. They all have the same root filesystem and 
<BR>
I don't deinstall packages on them. Works great, but updating is
<BR>
painfull. Updating means that I update one system and then synchronise 
<BR>
all others root partition to that, except the host specific files.
