<P><EM>&gt; I downloaded the compaq fortran compilers a couple weeks ago when they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were only available in rpm format.  I attempted to install using alien,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but ran into serious dependency problems, so I bailed.  I checked again
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; today and I found that they had put debian packages on their ftp site
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which I promptly downloaded (I really need these compilers).  Upon trying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to install them I ran into a dependency problem that seemed less than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trivial to me.  I am running slink, which uses libc6.1 version
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.0.7.something and the compilers require version 2.1.  I noticed that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; potato contains libc6.1 version 2.1, but needless to say dpkg spit that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one out when I tried to install it on my slink based system.  I'm a bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; afraid to just try to grab the source and install the new library because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have heard nightmare stories about people who have done that and then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their entire system did not work.  Could someone suggest a course of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; action?  Do I need to install potato?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, not at all (from memory here).  I made those debs, fyi, and, while
<BR>
they are made on a potato system (all I have), the binaries are all
<BR>
static with the exception of ladebug, which is linked to libcstd2.8 (and
<BR>
oldlibs package).  Let me know if you have any problems and I can attempt
<BR>
to regenerate the debs on a slink system.  Compaq has been VERY
<BR>
cooperative with my requests in regard to offering debs, so I don't expect
<BR>
resistance if something pops up like this.  Also, if they happen to catch
<BR>
this message, THANKS for the help regarding this.
<BR>
<P>Try to install the packages anyway, is my advice.  Use --force-depends,
<BR>
but please install them in the proper order according to their
<BR>
instructions.  From my recall, ladebug doesn't need to be installed, but
<BR>
the rest does, and in order.
