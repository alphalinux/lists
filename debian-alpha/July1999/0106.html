<P><EM>&gt; I'd like to make a few observations about the install:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There is a problem with the postinstall scripts for the cpml-ev*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; packages, in that they (well I don't know about ev6, I have ev5,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of course) do not generate the libcpml.so: I tried also to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; download the corresponding rpm and regenerate the deb from it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using alien. Then I looked at the rpm and did what the script was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supposed to do by hand. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is this one a problem with alien or something different?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes and no.  When I initially generated the debs, I missed a step that, as
<BR>
it turns out, alien didn't perform properly anyway (no big deal).  I've
<BR>
since fixed the problem and am waiting for word from Compaq as to when I
<BR>
can upload the fixed copies.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A final non technical observation: I think this is a great thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and compaq should be thanked, of course. What I didn't like that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much was the fact that compaq seems to consider rpm as the sole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distribution method (at least according to what they say on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; release notes), and that in general no mention of Debian is made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on their Linux web page (unlike for Suse and Caldera) despite the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fact that Debian has had an alpha dist for quite some time now.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've thanked them profusely and, despite the non-mention of us on their
<BR>
pages, they've been more than cooperative as far as getting debs up for
<BR>
distribution.  In short, I'm SLOWLY working on getting them to install
<BR>
Debian somewhere or at least some of the packaging tools so that they can
<BR>
generate their own debs.  Their stance, which sadly is somewhat
<BR>
understandable, is that RPM is the dominant choice of packaging formats on
<BR>
Alpha right now.  If we keep up the good work on the distribution and get
<BR>
mroe people to choose Debian, perhaps they'll change their minds :-)
