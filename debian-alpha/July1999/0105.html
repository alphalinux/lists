Hi everyone,
<BR>
<P>I installed the compaq fortran debs on an SX164. This is a
<BR>
&quot;mostly&quot; Slink machine, in the sense that there are still Hamm
<BR>
pieces in it. 
<BR>
<P>I'd like to make a few observations about the install:
<BR>
<P>As previously observed in this list one has to use
<BR>
--force-depends to get the debs installed on a slink system. 
<BR>
<P>There is a problem with the postinstall scripts for the cpml-ev*
<BR>
packages, in that they (well I don't know about ev6, I have ev5,
<BR>
of course) do not generate the libcpml.so: I tried also to
<BR>
download the corresponding rpm and regenerate the deb from it
<BR>
using alien. Then I looked at the rpm and did what the script was
<BR>
supposed to do by hand. 
<BR>
<P>Is this one a problem with alien or something different?
<BR>
<P>Anyway, doing the &quot;ld -shared ...&quot; plus /sbin/ldconfig by hand
<BR>
apparently made the warning about the cpml go away. Still, fort
<BR>
is able to compile but not to link some small test progs that
<BR>
should be linked with code produced by g77 (CERN Libraries).
<BR>
Removing that part made the program link allright. I'll post more
<BR>
about this. 
<BR>
<P>A final non technical observation: I think this is a great thing
<BR>
and compaq should be thanked, of course. What I didn't like that
<BR>
much was the fact that compaq seems to consider rpm as the sole
<BR>
distribution method (at least according to what they say on the
<BR>
release notes), and that in general no mention of Debian is made
<BR>
on their Linux web page (unlike for Suse and Caldera) despite the
<BR>
fact that Debian has had an alpha dist for quite some time now.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ettore
<BR>
