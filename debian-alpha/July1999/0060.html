<P>
Thanks for the work on making the debs.  Well I already bit the bullet,
<BR>
got familiar with apt-get and upgraded to potato.  Everything worked fine
<BR>
and I was able to install the fortran compiler without a hitch.  I
<BR>
proceeded to my project and was able to compile the source perfectly.
<BR>
Unfortunately, whenever I got to the linking phase I found an interesting
<BR>
problem.  Something was quite wrong with the installation of the compaq
<BR>
math libraries.  A simple test program which does nothing more than
<BR>
calculate the value of a trig function returns:
<BR>
<P>/usr/bin/ld: cannot open -lcpml: No such file or directory
<BR>
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
<BR>
fort: Severe: Failed while trying to link.
<BR>
<P>after some further checking (and reinstalling the compiler and math
<BR>
libraries) I believe that the problem is with the placement of the
<BR>
packages.  The libraries that come with the compiler install themselves to
<BR>
/usr/lib/compaq/library-name/.  However the documentation suggests that
<BR>
they should install their libraries directly to /usr/lib.  Another area of
<BR>
concern particularly with the cpml package is that after installation via
<BR>
dpkg it puts libcpml.a and cpml.h into the /usr/lib/compaq/cpml-0.2
<BR>
directory, but does create libcpml.so that is mentioned in the readme
<BR>
(this is supposed to be a replacement for libm.so).  I also tried putting
<BR>
the directories (/usr/lib/compaq/cpml-0.2/  etc) in ld.so.conf and then
<BR>
running ldconfig, but that did not solve the problem.
<BR>
<P>I also encountered another problem when I was playing with the installed
<BR>
files.  I tried to run ladebug from the command line with no imputs. I got
<BR>
this error message:
<BR>
<P>Ladebug Debugger Version 4.0-54 caught signal &quot;Segmentation fault&quot; (11).
<BR>
This is an unexpected condition and may indicate the presence of a defect.
<BR>
If you wish to report this, please include the stack trace that follows.
<BR>
Diagnostic stack trace ... %%% Jun 24 1999 00:21:25 %%%
<BR>
0x200005276a4 : __uflow
<BR>
0x2000052309c : getc
<BR>
end of diagnostic stack trace.
<BR>
Unexpected exception in Session::parseCommandFromCin
<BR>
(ladebug) Segmentation fault
<BR>
<P>Which brings me to my final question.  Are these things that I should be
<BR>
reporting to the debian-alpha list, or should these go to the compaq
<BR>
people offering the compiler?
<BR>
<P>Thanks for all the work so far, I really appreciate it,
<BR>

<EM>&gt; Try to install the packages anyway, is my advice.  Use --force-depends,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but please install them in the proper order according to their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instructions.  From my recall, ladebug doesn't need to be installed, but

<EM>&gt; the rest does, and in order.
