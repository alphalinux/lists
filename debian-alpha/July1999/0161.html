<P>Hi Ryan,
<BR>
I'm at a disadvantage here, because I don't have an Alpha and rely on
<BR>
others on debian-alpha to get postgresql packages compiled for Alpha.
<BR>
Thanks for your efforts on this.
<BR>
<P>I just want to comment on what you are saying about generating a Debian
<BR>
source package.  There will be a problem, because you are proposing to
<BR>
provide source that will be different from the main 6.5.1 source; however,
<BR>
the Debian archive assumes that source is identical across all architectures.
<BR>
This means that the Alpha source for PostgreSQL must not be uploaded to the
<BR>
Debian archive because it will replace the source for all other 
<BR>
architectures.
<BR>
<P>If this were to be a permanent problem, it could be addressed by renaming
<BR>
the packages; however, this would cause a lot of trouble to many users,
<BR>
so I don't want to do that when 6.6 will remove the need for it.
<BR>
<P>What I propose to do is to disable the Alpha build in the next version of
<BR>
the Debian package (6.5.1-4) and make it put out information that the
<BR>
Alpha source must be downloaded from &lt;somewhere&gt;.  I would prefer that to be
<BR>
in my account at www.debian.org, so that I can incorporate any changes
<BR>
that go into the mainstream package.
<BR>
<P><P><P>As to producing the Alpha packages, the procedure should go something
<BR>
like this:
<BR>
<P>1. Patch postgresql-6.5.1.orig (i.e. postgresql as provided at ftp.postgresql.org).
<BR>
<P>2. Examine the patches in the latest debian postgresql-6.5.1-x.diff.gz
<BR>
(where x is the latest Debian release) and merge everything that does
<BR>
not conflict with the new Alpha patches.
<BR>
<P>3. Update the version number in debian/changelog to 6.5.1-x.0.1alph and
<BR>
build the binary packages.
<BR>
<P>4. Upload the binary packages only.
<BR>
<P>5. Put the source package in my account (and make sure I have permission
<BR>
to write it!).
