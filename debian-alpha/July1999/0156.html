<P><EM>&gt; Old user of debian on Intel, I've decided to buy an Alpha system. But I need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some advices before.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - the motherboard is a Samsung Alpha 164 UX2, the processor a 21164, with a S3
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Virge 4Mo video, a Symbios UW SCSI. Is it possible without too many troubles to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  install the Slink on this system ? Is the Slink stable, as well on Intel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systems ?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure if the correct kernel is on the slink CD (or in the directory
<BR>
on ftp), so you may need a different kernel, but I haven't heard of any
<BR>
problems thusfar with the UX2s.  As for stability...I've been running
<BR>
slink (and now potato) for a long time now with very few problems if any.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - I've heard of several versions of the Alpha 21164 (pc, a ?). What are the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; differences ? and what version of the processor is installed on this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; motherboard ?
</EM><BR>
<P>If I remember correctly, the 21164a is on the UX2's.  The differences
<BR>
between the two (again, from what I recall...can't find my docs anywhere
<BR>
since I just moved) basically boils down to addressable cache.  The
<BR>
21164a's are superiour and can address up to 4MB of external cache.  I
<BR>
believe the PC's can only handle 1MB.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - I'm using PosgreSQL : does it run on Slink/Alpha ?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but you may have to compile it (don't worry...it's not tough at
<BR>
all...I can walk you through it since I helped get PostgreSQL working on
<BR>
Alpha again).  I'm currently using it to support a database at work and
<BR>
it's FAST!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - And, more generally, are they some special things to beware before buying thi
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; s machine ?
</EM><BR>
<P>None that I can think of.  You may want to check the RedHat axp-list
<BR>
archives specifically for things relating to the UX2, though, for
<BR>
machine-specific issues since my memory is obviously non-functioning today
<BR>
:-)
