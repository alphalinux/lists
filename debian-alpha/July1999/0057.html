<EM>&gt; I downloaded the compaq fortran compilers a couple weeks ago when they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were only available in rpm format.  I attempted to install using alien,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but ran into serious dependency problems, so I bailed.  I checked again
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; today and I found that they had put debian packages on their ftp site
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which I promptly downloaded (I really need these compilers).  Upon trying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to install them I ran into a dependency problem that seemed less than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trivial to me.  I am running slink, which uses libc6.1 version
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.0.7.something and the compilers require version 2.1.  I noticed that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; potato contains libc6.1 version 2.1, but needless to say dpkg spit that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one out when I tried to install it on my slink based system.  I'm a bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; afraid to just try to grab the source and install the new library because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have heard nightmare stories about people who have done that and then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their entire system did not work.  Could someone suggest a course of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; action?  Do I need to install potato?
</EM><BR>
<P>In any case, the only package manager that can handle 2.0-&gt;2.1 for Debian is
<BR>
apt.  Try availing yourself of its options; the binary is called &quot;apt-get&quot;. 
<BR>
Going to unstable isn't so bad, if you update when its dependencies are
<BR>
reconcilable.  There's also an apt-get 'chooser' out there now in beta, which
<BR>
might be even more useful after you install apt(-get), as apt itself won't let
<BR>
you choose individual packages but only the &quot;upgrade&quot; option via cli.  Sorry, I
<BR>
can't remember the name of the apt-chooser, but I'm fairly certain I remember
<BR>
it turning up on Freshmeat.
<BR>
<P>Big dummyhead that I am, I just became reacquainted with apt &gt; dpkg,
<BR>
categorically, with the perl 5.004-&gt;5 upgrade, which is in progress as I type.
<BR>
If only I had looked at the perl dpkg description earlier... ;)
<BR>
<P>Hope this smoothes the way for you, Luke.
