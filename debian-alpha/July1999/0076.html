<P>Actually, upon further review, it seems I'm wrong again (geez, big
<BR>
shock...I seem to be wrong alot today).  It's not the compiler
<BR>
misinterpreting at all.  It seems that it just doesn't like the cast (and
<BR>
for good reason....it shouldn't work at all according to standards).  I
<BR>
substituted an integer for the quote (I used 999) and it worked fine.  I
<BR>
also removed the ampersand from another line and got the same error that
<BR>
it was throwing before.  In short, until the menus are implemented more
<BR>
properly, I don't think we'll ever get this compiled on Alpha.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; GTK most definitely is a magic box. put stuff in, different stuff comes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out and it worked somehow.
</EM><BR>
<P>I guess now's the time to figure out how it worked :-)  It seems that some
<BR>
back-end assumptions were being made on the i386-compiled code, but the
<BR>
Alpha compiler must be more picky about making such assumptions.  Either
<BR>
that or the GTK code itself somehow behaves slightly differently on
<BR>
certain archs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Well, I was actually planning on getting one as my next computer, not sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where I'm gonna get the cash though.. heh
</EM><BR>
<P>They're not bad if you get them on eBay.  I built a nice 164SX 533MHz
<BR>
machine for a hair over $500 (I did have a nice SCSI hard drive
<BR>
already,though, which saved me some $$$).
