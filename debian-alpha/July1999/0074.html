<EM>&gt; &gt; Item 4 seems to be what screws up the Alpha compiles. Here's how I got it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to work the way I needed it to...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Item 4 wants an int, I needed to put a string there because it would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; simplify things GREATLY. After trying various things, it somehow worked by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; casting the char* to int because it got cast back to a char* somewhere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; withing GTK. I still do not know how this worked.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This is what happens without the cast to int...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; In file included from toolbars.c:41:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; menu.h:86: warning: initialization makes integer from pointer without a cast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It still works on my system, but having appx 400 warnings pop up during a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; compile is not something I like to see, esp when it works if I do a cheesy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; hack like casting it to an int. ;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hmmm...well, technically, doing such casts really isn't great to do since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's Just Not Proper(TM).  But, I don't think that the cast is what's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; throwing us for a loop here.  It appears that the compiler itself is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ignoring the quotes and trying to interpret something like &quot;&amp;test&quot; just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like it does with &amp;test (which are obviously two seperate things).  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be more proper, obviously, to not do such casts, though, and rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; associate the ints with the text another way.  This may be the only way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that we're going to compile it on the Alpha for now, unfortunately.
</EM><BR>
<P>eek, that would be one hell of a compiler bug...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The GTK stuff says that using gint is more portable than using just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; straight int. So if someone wants to try that as a fix, then run &quot;sed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; s/(int)/(gint)/ menu.h&quot;. I'm not sure if that will do much other than just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cast it back to regular int. It might work, who knows.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'll give it a shot, but I don't think it'll work.  From my (very)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; limited knowledge of GTK, it seems that they try to provide something akin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to a &quot;magic box&quot; programming model, where you give it info and it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transforms it for you (hence the cast to int working somehow), but this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; behaviour may not be terribly portable, unfortunately.
</EM><BR>
<P>GTK most definitely is a magic box. put stuff in, different stuff comes
<BR>
out and it worked somehow.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I'm pretty clueless about this as the highest bit processor I have worked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with is 32 and I can't test for stuff like this. I really need to get an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; alpha... hehe.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hehehehe...you should!  64-bit Linux is a wonderful thing :-)  It's really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not hard to adapt to and it seems that the code is portable otherwise, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I wouldn't worry too much.  Just be careful when it comes to assumptions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the sizes of some of the common types.  On Alpha, short=2, int=4,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and long=8.  Also, void=8, fyi....a big change from i386-land...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; C
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I was actually planning on getting one as my next computer, not sure
<BR>
where I'm gonna get the cash though.. heh
