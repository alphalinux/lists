Hi Chris (and all the rest of the list)...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know you do a great deal to further the Debian cause on the Alpha
<BR>
platforms and have techniques you utilize to correct this type of a problem
<BR>
(unaligned traps).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was wondering if there is a HOWTO paper anywhere which describes the
<BR>
methods to review the source code of applications (and any other software
<BR>
source code as well) to find and correct unaligned traps and other
<BR>
&quot;features&quot; &lt;grin&gt;...  One of the reasons for the question is Snort in Potato
<BR>
currently has such a &quot;feature&quot; and is also at least 2 revisions behind the
<BR>
current version of Snort... I would like to clean it up (reduce the
<BR>
/var/log/messages file size to relevant information).  I know you and the
<BR>
rest of the list have other more pressing issues to deal with and this would
<BR>
give me more insight into the alpha.
<BR>
<P>Any suggestions or sources of information would be greatly appreciated (and
<BR>
then I could get the latest version of Snort running as well &lt;grin&gt;...)...
<BR>
<P>Oh - btw:  The last time I had sent an email to you it was about the Seti
<BR>
program not working on my system and you (and a few others) suggested using
<BR>
a different method - well - I did it a different way than that... I
<BR>
downloaded the latest version for Linux-alpha and just used the -nolock flag
<BR>
and the software was happy (just have to watch out and not try to run
<BR>
multiple sessions in the same directory &lt;grin&gt;).... worked out fine that way
<BR>
(and kept it running in a pure Debian environment too)...
<BR>
<P>gm...
