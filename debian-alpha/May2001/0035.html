Hi,
<BR>
<P>[... stuff deleted ...]
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The VM has been reworked quite a bit.  Did you hit swap during any of your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tests?  Also, is this EV6 or EV67?
</EM><BR>
<P>Reworked is good - it's rather a total rewrite ;-) The VM is one of my suspects, but
<BR>
I also question the new scheduling policies.
<BR>
As all UP2000's being EV-67 ( or 68 ), mine is a EV-67, 667Mhz and 2Mbytes L2.
<BR>
The system comes with 1.5Gig RAM, which should ( and does ) ensure, that swap
<BR>
isn't reached.
<BR>
<P>[ ... on kernel 2.2.19 crashing ...] 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Take out the RTC and see if that helps. I've had problems with it on my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; UP2k here and there.  I don't think that it is a good solution,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personally, but if it works...
</EM><BR>
<P>Good, i'll try that. I obviously have CONFIG_RTC set. On that issue: It used to be the
<BR>
case, that the Alphas encountered clock-skews without that option set in earlier 2.2 kernels,
<BR>
that could be overcome by setting RTC. Is that resolved ? Having the correct time is
<BR>
quite critical in my setup ( time-based services running across several NFS exports ).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What other cards do you have in the system?  Oh, also, bear in mind that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Adaptec driver has changed in 2.4.x, IIRC, so that may explain things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by itself :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>It's 3 adaptecs in there, plus one 3COM networking card ( 905B ). I've seperately ran
<BR>
tests on all harddrives, using bonnie, hdparm and my own stuff. All results indicated no
<BR>
difference in drive performance and associated CPU consumption. All disks are in fact
<BR>
SCSI disks. I had one IDE drive with an SCSI-to-IDE adaptor being connected to it;s
<BR>
own adaptec ( since it can't do TCQ ), but that was completely disabled during the tests.
<BR>
I am aware, that there is a completely new aic driver in 2.4.4, which gave the reason
<BR>
to test disk performance.
<BR>
I do like the fact, that the new driver is apparently able to determine the optimum TCQ depth
<BR>
during run-time. However, i prefer to set things via boot-parameters. Anybody ever
<BR>
figured out, how to do that with the new driver ?
<BR>
<P>On the issue of the performance difference, i have had tests, that measure process CPU
<BR>
consumption with both, times(2) and getrusage(2). The ones with getrusage(2) show
<BR>
strange behaviour, by giving user-times on kernel 2.2.19, that are questionable.
<BR>
<P>Has anybody ever found evidence, that getrusage() reports strange user-times ?
<BR>
The most bizarre thing is, that real- as well as system time seem OK, as well as times(2) times ;-)
<BR>
<P>Anyway, this _is_ weird....
<BR>
<P><P>Regards,
<BR>
Kirk
