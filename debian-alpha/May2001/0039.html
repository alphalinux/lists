<P><EM>&gt; Reworked is good - it's rather a total rewrite ;-) The VM is one of my suspects, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I also question the new scheduling policies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As all UP2000's being EV-67 ( or 68 ), mine is a EV-67, 667Mhz and 2Mbytes L2.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The system comes with 1.5Gig RAM, which should ( and does ) ensure, that swap
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't reached.
</EM><BR>
<P>True, but I've seen stranger things happen :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Good, i'll try that. I obviously have CONFIG_RTC set. On that issue: It used to be the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; case, that the Alphas encountered clock-skews without that option set in earlier 2.2 kernels,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that could be overcome by setting RTC. Is that resolved ? Having the correct time is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quite critical in my setup ( time-based services running across several NFS exports ).
</EM><BR>
<P>I would recommend running an NTP daemon or something to sync the time on
<BR>
all of your servers on boot and periodically rather than relying on the
<BR>
RTC.  It tends to be more reliable when you're dealing with multiple
<BR>
servers anyway (rather than having to set time that's fairly close on
<BR>
multiple machines by hand).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It's 3 adaptecs in there, plus one 3COM networking card ( 905B ). I've seperately ran
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tests on all harddrives, using bonnie, hdparm and my own stuff. All results indicated no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difference in drive performance and associated CPU consumption. All disks are in fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SCSI disks. I had one IDE drive with an SCSI-to-IDE adaptor being connected to it;s
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own adaptec ( since it can't do TCQ ), but that was completely disabled during the tests.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am aware, that there is a completely new aic driver in 2.4.4, which gave the reason
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to test disk performance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I do like the fact, that the new driver is apparently able to determine the optimum TCQ depth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; during run-time. However, i prefer to set things via boot-parameters. Anybody ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; figured out, how to do that with the new driver ?
</EM><BR>
<P>I haven't looked at it too hard yet.  I personally like the old driver
<BR>
better, but that's only because I'm more familiar with it code-wise :-P
<BR>
<P>Was there much net traffic when you ran the tests or was the 3Com mostly
<BR>
inactive?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; On the issue of the performance difference, i have had tests, that measure process CPU
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consumption with both, times(2) and getrusage(2). The ones with getrusage(2) show
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strange behaviour, by giving user-times on kernel 2.2.19, that are questionable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Has anybody ever found evidence, that getrusage() reports strange user-times ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The most bizarre thing is, that real- as well as system time seem OK, as well as times(2) times ;-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Not yet.  I'll see if I can free up some time to look at it more
<BR>
in-depth.  Sounds like you definitely have a strange case,
<BR>
though.  Perhaps I'll run some tests on my UP2k at work over the coming
<BR>
weekend and see if I get similar results.
