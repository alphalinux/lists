<P><EM>&gt;     I know you do a great deal to further the Debian cause on the Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; platforms and have techniques you utilize to correct this type of a problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (unaligned traps).
</EM><BR>
<P>It's actually easier now that it used to be...we have a binary that will
<BR>
fire up gdb when an unaligned access occurs and puts us right at the spot
<BR>
in question.
<BR>
<P>I'm attaching the source for it, so enjoy it :-)
<BR>
<P>All you need to do, once it's compiled, is type:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unaligned &lt;binary&gt;
<BR>
Where &lt;binary&gt; is the name of the programme that's showing unaligned
<BR>
traps.  I highly recommend doing this on unstripped programmes, though,
<BR>
since otherwise, you may not be able to easily correlate where you are
<BR>
when in gdb with the source code.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &quot;features&quot; &lt;grin&gt;...  One of the reasons for the question is Snort in Potato
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; currently has such a &quot;feature&quot; and is also at least 2 revisions behind the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; current version of Snort... I would like to clean it up (reduce the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; /var/log/messages file size to relevant information).  I know you and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rest of the list have other more pressing issues to deal with and this would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; give me more insight into the alpha.
</EM><BR>
<P>I looked at snort awhile ago, but didn't have the conditions to reproduce
<BR>
the unaligned access (it used to happen only if you had a ppp
<BR>
connection...I only have ethernets on this box, so I didn't see the
<BR>
trap messages).  I think this behaviour has changed, though, so it would
<BR>
probably be a good thing to go over again with 'unaligned' to see where
<BR>
the problems are now.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Oh - btw:  The last time I had sent an email to you it was about the Seti
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; program not working on my system and you (and a few others) suggested using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a different method - well - I did it a different way than that... I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; downloaded the latest version for Linux-alpha and just used the -nolock flag
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the software was happy (just have to watch out and not try to run
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; multiple sessions in the same directory &lt;grin&gt;).... worked out fine that way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (and kept it running in a pure Debian environment too)...
</EM><BR>
<P>Glad that we could help :-)
