Hi,
<BR>
<P>[.... jobs running into swap ? ...]
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; True, but I've seen stranger things happen :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Me too ;-) But after checking my entries in /proc, the was no swap activity during
<BR>
all of the benchmark runs.
<BR>
<P>[... CONFIG_RTC broken in 2.2.19/alpha SMP ...]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I would recommend running an NTP daemon or something to sync the time on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all of your servers on boot and periodically rather than relying on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RTC.  It tends to be more reliable when you're dealing with multiple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; servers anyway (rather than having to set time that's fairly close on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; multiple machines by hand).
</EM><BR>
<P>I do already run ntp synchronized to an external clock-source. But until ntp gets
<BR>
started, various files have their atime and ctime already set to a date in the year 2049.
<BR>
That, of course, sucks. Also, in my ntp-setup, a clock-skew of that difference, causes
<BR>
ntp to write to logs instead of happily adjusting date+time back 50 years ;-)
<BR>
I could configure it otherwise, of course, but I'd rather stick with my current setup, whch
<BR>
is necessary for various reasons.
<BR>
Set aside the fact, that i strongly dislike working around obvious kernel-bugs that way.
<BR>
Currently, I'm poking around the rtc-driver in an attempt to fix the stuff myself.
<BR>
Therefore the question, if any patch is already available ( maybe in 2.2.20-pre.. ) ?
<BR>
<P>[.... on the new aic .vs. old aic driver ...]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I haven't looked at it too hard yet.  I personally like the old driver
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; better, but that's only because I'm more familiar with it code-wise :-P
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, the new driver did not show any obvious problems yet. Since my setup's purpose is
<BR>
(partly ) to verify configs, that are duplicated in customers machines, I maintain, my
<BR>
personal preference has to be to stick to mainstream configs as close as possible - on
<BR>
*that* machine, that is ;-)
<BR>
<P>[ at this point, it should be mentioned, what a *great distribution* Debian is, when it
<BR>
comes to running business critical/relevant jobs. Thanx and respect to all involved.
<BR>
This has to be said, once in a while, IMHO ;-) ]
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Was there much net traffic when you ran the tests or was the 3Com mostly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inactive?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd say, mostly inactive. However, the UP2000 runs headless with an x86 serving as
<BR>
multihead-Xterminal. So all traffic between Xserver on the x86 and xterms, fvwm2 and
<BR>
the like on the alpha goes via net. So, there is *some* traffic, but i'd hardly call it
<BR>
significant.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Not yet.  I'll see if I can free up some time to look at it more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in-depth.  Sounds like you definitely have a strange case,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though.  Perhaps I'll run some tests on my UP2k at work over the coming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weekend and see if I get similar results.
</EM><BR>
<P>Mee too. I currently pushed the issue a bit down on my to-do list and reverted back
<BR>
to 2.4.4. But i'll look into it in the next days and provide further details.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
T. Weyergraf
