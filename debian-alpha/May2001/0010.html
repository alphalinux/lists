<P><EM>&gt; I'm looking for a few people to help with creating boot-floppies for

<EM>&gt; Alpha. Right now a lot of work needs to be done in a very short amount
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of time. We need to get the woody boot-floppies created and tested or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we'll probably end up not having a woody release for Alpha. So I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looking for a few people who are willing to work as a small team on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it. Do I have any volunteers?
</EM><BR>
<P>I've gotten many responses (thanks!) Here is what we need to do first:
<BR>
<P>1) Those of you who are currently Debian Developers and are willing to
<BR>
help with coding on boot-floppies, please contact me and let me know
<BR>
that you ARE a DD. 
<BR>
<P>2) Those of you who want to become Debian Developers and also want to
<BR>
help with coding on the boot-floppies, please contact me and let me
<BR>
know that you WANT to become a DD.
<BR>
<P>3) Those of you who are not Debian Developers and don't want to become
<BR>
one, you can still help with testing! Those of you who have already
<BR>
emailed me, I still have your name/address so you don't need to do
<BR>
anything but watch here for an announcement when were are ready to
<BR>
start testing.
<BR>
<P>Big thanks to everyone who has offered to help!
