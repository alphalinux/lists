<EM>&gt; Hi,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [... stuff deleted ...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The VM has been reworked quite a bit.  Did you hit swap during any of your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; tests?  Also, is this EV6 or EV67?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Reworked is good - it's rather a total rewrite ;-) The VM is one of my suspects, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I also question the new scheduling policies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As all UP2000's being EV-67 ( or 68 ), mine is a EV-67, 667Mhz and 2Mbytes L2.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not all UP2000s run with EV67 (or 68), there are some that have 
<BR>
EV6 slotBs, yours is a 67 though.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Good, i'll try that. I obviously have CONFIG_RTC set. On that issue: It used to be the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; case, that the Alphas encountered clock-skews without that option set in earlier 2.2 kernels,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that could be overcome by setting RTC. Is that resolved ? Having the correct time is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quite critical in my setup ( time-based services running across several NFS exports ).
</EM><BR>
<P>If I remember correctly RTC in 2.2 is broken for SMP....did you have 2
<BR>
CPUs? Don't remember seeing that.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; What other cards do you have in the system?  Oh, also, bear in mind that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the Adaptec driver has changed in 2.4.x, IIRC, so that may explain things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; by itself :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's 3 adaptecs in there, plus one 3COM networking card ( 905B ). I've seperately ran
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tests on all harddrives, using bonnie, hdparm and my own stuff. All results indicated no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difference in drive performance and associated CPU consumption. All disks are in fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SCSI disks. I had one IDE drive with an SCSI-to-IDE adaptor being connected to it;s
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own adaptec ( since it can't do TCQ ), but that was completely disabled during the tests.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am aware, that there is a completely new aic driver in 2.4.4, which gave the reason
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to test disk performance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I do like the fact, that the new driver is apparently able to determine the optimum TCQ depth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; during run-time. However, i prefer to set things via boot-parameters. Anybody ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; figured out, how to do that with the new driver ?
</EM><BR>
<P>There's two adaptec drivers in 2.4 right? One from Adaptec and then the
<BR>
original one (which is no longer maintained). Haven't even tried to
<BR>
compilethe adaptec version yet.....perhaps that could be one of the
<BR>
differences??
