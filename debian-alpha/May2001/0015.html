Hello Ron,
<BR>
<P>I have a bunch of Alpha's (I have a least one of every DEC/Compaq model) but 
<BR>
not a lot of time.  If this is something that could be done in a day or so, I 
<BR>
would be happy to help.
<BR>
<P>Best Regards,
<BR>

<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm looking for a few people to help with creating boot-floppies for

<EM>&gt; &gt; we'll probably end up not having a woody release for Alpha. So I'm

<EM>&gt; &gt; looking for a few people who are willing to work as a small team on

<EM>&gt; &gt; it. Do I have any volunteers?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've gotten many responses (thanks!) Here is what we need to do first:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1) Those of you who are currently Debian Developers and are willing to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; help with coding on boot-floppies, please contact me and let me know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that you ARE a DD.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2) Those of you who want to become Debian Developers and also want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; help with coding on the boot-floppies, please contact me and let me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know that you WANT to become a DD.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3) Those of you who are not Debian Developers and don't want to become
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one, you can still help with testing! Those of you who have already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; emailed me, I still have your name/address so you don't need to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything but watch here for an announcement when were are ready to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; start testing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Big thanks to everyone who has offered to help!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ron
