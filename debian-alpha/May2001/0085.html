<P>
I have 2 Debian/Alpha machines running v2.2r3 stable with nearly
<BR>
identical setups.  Machine #2 has no problems.  On Machine #1, I have 
<BR>
experimented with 2.4.4 kernels and have had problems with it, so both 
<BR>
machines are running v2.2.19 of the kernel.
<BR>
<P>The problem is that somehow the file /var/run/random-seed got corrupted on 
<BR>
machine #1.  This file is packaged by sysvinit and is created on bootup by
<BR>
the /etc/init.d/urandom script.  The problem is that I cannot remove the 
<BR>
corrupted file /var/run/random-seed.  I get an error message 
<BR>
<P>fea6:/var/run# rm random-seed
<BR>
rm: cannot remove `random-seed': Input/output error
<BR>
fea6:/var/run#
<BR>
<P>This file is normally overwritten from /dev/random on boot.  So I suspect 
<BR>
that somehow a v2.4.4 kernel boot has caused this corruption.
<BR>
<P>I have tried copying the 512 byte file from Machine #2 and write over Machine 
<BR>
#1 file just to force this problem to clear, but it will not do it.
<BR>
<P>This problem also causes the entire AMANDA backup of this filesystem to fail 
<BR>
due to this one file; bummer!
<BR>
<P>I have not tried to reboot yet to see if this will help fix the problem.  I 
<BR>
am a little worried about doing that for fear of another problem might show 
<BR>
up.  
<BR>
<P>I also wonder if this is related to why I have had problems with the v2.4.4 
<BR>
kernel.  I can't remember if random number generation is needed in the kernel 
<BR>
?
<BR>
<P>Does anyone know how I can force /var/run/random-seed to go away and be 
<BR>
recreated ?
<BR>
<P>Thanks
