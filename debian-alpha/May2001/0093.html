<P>
I have had trouble with each new version of the 2.4.x kernel on my 
<BR>
Debian/Alpha machine.  Now I know why it is failing, but I will need help to 
<BR>
fix it.
<BR>
<P>Quite by accident, the ethernet card was disabled from the .config after a 
<BR>
clean &quot;make oldconfig&quot; from a working 2.2.19 kernel.  This worked fine 
<BR>
without any problems.  However, I quickly realized that there was no ethernet 
<BR>
card enabled.
<BR>
<P>The machine has a Digitial Fast Etherworks DE500-AA network card.  The 2.2.19 
<BR>
kernel config selects the &quot;Generic DECchip &amp; Digital Etherworks&quot; selection 
<BR>
and works great.  However, this selection with any 2.4.x kernel (now I know) 
<BR>
fails (after a period of time).   I have also tried the &quot;DECchip Tulip&quot; and 
<BR>
&quot;DEPCA, DE...&quot; selections.  The tulip card also works for a period of time, 
<BR>
but fails.  DEPCA doesn't work at all (so it never causes the system to fail 
<BR>
and crash).  Yes, the system fails with a hard crash which causes a 
<BR>
file-system check on boot.  Fortunately, I have always recovered on the 
<BR>
reboot.
<BR>
<P>Also, I use the knfsd option.  Is this working for the Alpha ?  I think I may 
<BR>
have read where this could be a problem.  I also use automount.
<BR>
<P>Any help is appreciated
<BR>
