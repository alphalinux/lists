<P>
I have a AS 1000A 4/266 (Noritake) with 128M memory running Debian unstable 
<BR>
just fine, but as I don't have it doing anything right now I wanted to install 
<BR>
Tru64 5.1 to play around with it but the kernel on the install CD, a CDR direct 
<BR>
copy of an original from Compaq, doesn't even boot. It starts loading the 
<BR>
kernel and booting it but panics with something like &quot;Machine Check : Hardware 
<BR>
Error&quot;. If it really is hardware I'd like to see if I can figure out what's 
<BR>
wrong and possibly fix/replace it, but the thing I don't get is Linux runs just 
<BR>
fine without error. I even ran memtest from sysutils for a day and it never 
<BR>
burped. While I'm on the subject is there a way to test all of hte memory, 
<BR>
Linux will only let memtest mlock 50% of the available memory, so it could be 
<BR>
missing the bad chip if there is one.
<BR>
<P>I also just noticed an error on the SRM console when I shutdown Linux, it said:
<BR>
<P>System Machine Check through vector 660
<BR>
Machine Check Code: 0x205
<BR>
Idsel not asserted
<BR>
<P>If the IPRs: info after that is important I can send that too, but it's a lot 
<BR>
to type right now =)
<BR>
<P>I am running SRM V5.6-106 because it supports my DAC960 since the newer ones 
<BR>
don't see it, but since it happened with the newer SRM too I don't think that's 
<BR>
the problem.
<BR>
<P>Any ideas?
<BR>
