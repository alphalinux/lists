<P>
We've been having problems getting routed or zebra to work on a fairly
<BR>
current potato system.  A similar configuration works quite happily on
<BR>
an i386 Slink machine.  Both systems are running kernel 2.2.14.
<BR>
<P>routed doesn't seem to be able to discover neighbouring routers
<BR>
(although when you point it at one it picks up routes just fine) and
<BR>
refuses to advertise any routes.  It seems that what happens is that
<BR>
when it looks for interfaces routed gets (IIRC) ENODEV and so decides
<BR>
that it doesn't have any connected ethernets.
<BR>
<P>Zebra seems to suffer from the same problem - it disclaims all knowledge
<BR>
of all the interfaces, but I haven't checked to see that it's getting
<BR>
the same error.  The only other networking program I've had problems
<BR>
with is nmap, which also reported being unable to find locally attached
<BR>
interfaces.  Otherwise, the system seems to be functioning normally.
<BR>
<P>What am I missing here (I checked the kernel configuration, but I may
<BR>
have missed something)?
<BR>
