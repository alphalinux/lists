<P>
The following message is a courtesy copy of an article
<BR>
that has been posted to comp.os.linux.alpha,comp.windows.x.kde as well.
<BR>
<P><P>Thanks to all who sent in help.  The fix to the problem was
<BR>
to delete the character string &quot;,yp&quot; from the file &quot;/etc/svc.conf&quot;
<BR>
that was installed by the Compaq package.  The program had the
<BR>
appearance of hanging X11, but it was just searching the net for
<BR>
something it would never find.  The probem was totally unrelated to
<BR>
kde.  The error messages I was getting from a kde package was just a
<BR>
message printed in abruptly exiting kde with cntrl-alt-backspace.
<BR>
<P>Netscape is really nice on an Alpha!  Thanks be to Compaq and
<BR>
Netscape!
