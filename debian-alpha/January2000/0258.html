Hi,
<BR>
<P>I've gotten the full set of boot-floppies to build to my satisfaction and
<BR>
sort of work - they boot on my PC164SX with SRM and dbootstrap runs (library
<BR>
reduction was broken but I fixed it).
<BR>
<P>The set is at <A HREF="http://eradicator.org/debian/alpha-potato-boot/">http://eradicator.org/debian/alpha-potato-boot/</A>
<BR>
<P>Some notes:
<BR>
<P>1) I'm using MILO 2.2-14, so there are separate disks (bootable from
<BR>
ARC/AlphaBIOS and SRM, or at least, I hope so :) with MILO and linload.exe
<BR>
on them.
<BR>
<P>2) There is a single rescue disk, built from the generic 2.2.13 image (there
<BR>
isn't a 2.2.14 package yet, I think I might build it).  Two issues to keep
<BR>
in mind:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;* IP autoconfiguration is turned on, and in 2.2 it takes MUCH longer for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BOOTP and RARP requests to time out :(  so be patient ... next version
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;won't have this &quot;feature&quot;.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;* The kernel is compiled for SRM/aboot, so I don't know if MILO will boot
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it.  We may have to have two separate rescue disks in that case.
<BR>
<P>3) For SRM you can still boot directly from the rescue disk.  I put an
<BR>
aboot.conf on the disk but I'm not sure it will work right, as I haven't
<BR>
tested it.  The full boot command should be:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; boot dva0 -file linux -flags &quot;root=/dev/fd0 load_ramdisk=1&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>4) Yes, the base system is morbidly obese.  This is partly because libc is
<BR>
not stripped, but actually the main space waster is locales, it seems.
<BR>
<P>And of course, the usual caveats about this being CVS boot-floppies apply
<BR>
... some of the installation sequence might be broken.  Comments about
<BR>
dbootstrap and such should probably go to debian-boot.
<BR>
<P>I'm going to do a test install on a spare disk here soon.  Things I'd like
<BR>
other people to test are:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;- ARC and AlphaBIOS installs
<BR>
&nbsp;- Installs on machines with defective SRM (Jensen, anyone?)
<BR>
&nbsp;- Netbooting
<BR>
<P>One big gotcha for SRM is that you'll be dropped into cfdisk for
<BR>
partitioning.  I'm thinking that there should be some way for dbootstrap to
<BR>
notice that you're booting from SRM, and run fdisk instead.
<BR>
