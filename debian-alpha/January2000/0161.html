<P>
Because Debian on Alpha doesn't work very well with the 2.0 kernel (at
<BR>
least on my Miata type machine), I upgraded to 2.2.  The problems included
<BR>
the known init issue as well as multiple X things.  The libncurses4
<BR>
problem is nothing to sneeze at either, but at least it's managable. Also,
<BR>
I'm running a fairly minimal unstable (woody, now?) dist-upgraded from the
<BR>
slink base. 
<BR>
<P>But neither the stock 2.2.13 nor the 2.2.14 I build myself seems to work
<BR>
with the ethernet, though 2.0 did.  I cannot contact any IPs other than
<BR>
127.0.0.1. Has anyone else had this problem?  Could someone give me some
<BR>
ideas?  When displaying the routing tables with the route command, it
<BR>
hangs after showing localnet. And the card is recognized and everything on
<BR>
bootup. (It's a tulip.) Thanks.
