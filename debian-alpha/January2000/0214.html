<P><EM>&gt; Fact is: it didn't work with the latest CVS checkout on Alpha, it did work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the two lines reverted to the previous version. We'll look into it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Now that I think of it, the alpha-functioning version of these two
<BR>
lines broke things on i386.  In the worst case, you can put a switch
<BR>
that depends on the current architecture, rather than one sed line for
<BR>
all arches.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; YOu can make this problem go away if you just build your kernels with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; those built in... Will it fit?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not sure. We are pretty short of space already with MILO and the kernel. My
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guess is that it won't work but I'll check. There aren't any 2.2.14 alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kernel images anyway so I'll have to consult with Herbert Xu about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; configuration.
</EM><BR>
<P>Um, Herbert does the alpha kernels as well as i386?  that doesn't
<BR>
sound right.  Anyhow, there's no reason why the alpha kernel has to
<BR>
match the i386 one option by option.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Are you working from CVS?  Will you be committing your changes or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sending patches?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, we are working from CVS but I guess we aren't allowed to commit changes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unless every developer automatically gets commit access.
</EM><BR>
<P>They do.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So the choice is yours which way we should sync up.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would suggest just commiting to CVS, but first making sure that none
<BR>
of the alpha changes will *break* other platforms, espeically i386.
<BR>
If in doubt, wait until 2.2.5 is uploaded.
