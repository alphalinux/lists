<P><EM>&gt;  Cool.  I just checked their web site, and found that Debian is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  mentioned at all!  Will you please have their webmaster add us to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  list of Linux distributions?  It would be great to see our logo up on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the Compaq sites.

<P>We're currently working with them to get their first Debian installation
<BR>
going.  With a company as large as &quot;the big Q&quot;, it's hard to get in
<BR>
contact with the right people sometimes :-)  I've been working with their
<BR>
compiler group for at least 6 months, but they don't handle the
<BR>
website.  You know how these things go :-)
