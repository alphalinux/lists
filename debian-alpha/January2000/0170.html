<P>
Thanks for the tip about the de4x5 driver.  That did the trick.  But now
<BR>
I'm having a new problem: sound.  It works, but it appears to play at half
<BR>
speed.  This problem seems only to occur for mp3s, though, but all the
<BR>
different mp3 players have the same problem (mpg123, xmms, etc.)  The date
<BR>
comand seems to follow the time correctly, but the time that the sound
<BR>
player shows seems to go by at half the speed it should.  I have a Miata,
<BR>
specifically a PW 500a, and I'm fairly sure it has an ES1888. Here is the
<BR>
boot messages I get for the audio config (nothing looks wrong with it that
<BR>
I can see): 
<BR>
<P>Sound initialization started
<BR>
ESS chip ES1888 detected
<BR>
&lt;ESS ES1888 AudioDrive (rev 11) (3.01)&gt; at 0x220 irq 5 dma 1,5
<BR>
&lt;ESS ES1688&gt; at 0x330 irq 9 dma 0
<BR>
&lt;Yamaha OPL3&gt; at 0x388
<BR>
Sound initialization complete
<BR>
<P>Any ideas?  Oh, and one other thing, which is probably not an
<BR>
Alpha-related matter per se: Window Maker shows a nifty root menu that
<BR>
changes when I install packages on my x86 system, but shows a fixed menu
<BR>
on this system.  How can I fix this? 
<BR>
<P>Thanks.
<BR>
<P>Martin.
