<P>
The aboot in Debian is severly out of date.  I've just gone through
<BR>
some difficulties, and thought I'd spare others the trouble.
<BR>
<P>I decided to convert my system (PC164LX) from AlphaBIOS/MILO to
<BR>
SRM/aboot, for a couple reasons:
<BR>
1. it boots quicker
<BR>
2. my colleagues (I work for Compaq in the Alpha chip group) tell me
<BR>
that SRM has better/more recent PALcode than MILO.  This is evidently
<BR>
more important for EV6-based systems.
<BR>
3. I'm crazy in the head, and had nothing better to do with my evening.
<BR>
<P>I had to back up one of my drives and repartition it using BSD
<BR>
disklabels, as in the new SRM HOWTO on AlphaLinux.org.  This was a big
<BR>
PITA, but presented no real difficulties.
<BR>
<P>I also had to rebuild my kernel with SRM and BSD disklabel support. 
<BR>
Wanting to upgrade to 2.2.14 was the motivation behind this whole mess.
<BR>
<P>The big problem is that the aboot in Potato (0.5-4) doesn't understand
<BR>
recently-created ext2 filesystems.  ext2 has had a couple of
<BR>
extensions added to it, evidently, that our version of aboot doesn't
<BR>
understand.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, to fix the problem, I downloaded the RPM for aboot 0.5-15 from
<BR>
RedHat and installed via alien.  I can boot now...
<BR>
