hello
<BR>
<P>I've had my AXPpci33 for about a year now, and it has been running Slink
<BR>
2.1 for almost as long. Recently I got a leased line and decided it should
<BR>
work as a router/firewall. So, an upgrade to get rid of the time problems
<BR>
and get a faster system, I wanted to upgrade to a 2.2 kernel.
<BR>
<P>But, the milo (2.0.30) doesn't like 2.2-kernels and I don't know how to
<BR>
install a 2.2 milo, so I tried to get 2.0.38 running. I fetched the latest
<BR>
slink egcs and cpp, aswell as the 2.0.38 as .deb. There's a problem with
<BR>
2.0.38, it wants to add -m21164a when invoking gas (I used menuconfig,
<BR>
that might matter) but replaced that with -m21066 and finally got
<BR>
something that booted.
<BR>
<P>The kernel reports this
<BR>
bios32.sio_fixup: weird, device 8086:0484 coming in on slot 7 has no irq line!!
<BR>
(I don't know if this matters)
<BR>
<P>it continues and then halts with a scsi busy, waits a while and then
<BR>
stops.
<BR>
<P>The scsi driver I compiled was the Generic NCR5380/53c400, as that was the
<BR>
closest I could find, is it the wrong one? (port mode)
<BR>
<P>Equipment:
<BR>
<P>ET4000 (ISA)
<BR>
NE2000 (ISA, not in pnp-mode)
<BR>
3COM 3C900 (PCI)
<BR>
0.2+1.0GB Conner SCSI disks
<BR>
<P>The cards have been tested with 2.2.13 on an i386-machine and worked.
<BR>
<P>Any hints about what I'm doing wrong would be very welcome!
<BR>
<P><P>yours
<BR>
