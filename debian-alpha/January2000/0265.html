<EM>&gt; Any opinions from other Alpha users ?

<P>Yeah, I was hoping to get some opinions on this with my other posts on the
<BR>
subject.  Failing that I figured I'd try it out to see if it causes problems
<BR>
or not ... apparently it does :(
<BR>
<P>Can the 2.0 milos cope with 2.2-formatted filesystems?  (i.e. sparse
<BR>
superblock, other features)  In my experience they can't, so that was one
<BR>
reason to use the 2.2 MILO.  The other is that Ruffian appears to be better
<BR>
supported in the 2.2.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, the 2.0 MILOs appear to be much better tested (the SuSE
<BR>
guy says the 2.2 ones are only really tested on 164LX and Ruffian)
<BR>
<P>Oh, as to your earlier question, about leaving the System.map off the
<BR>
rescue disk, that's where it typically gets installed from, but seeing as
<BR>
i386 may be going with a different kernel on the rescue disk anyway, we'll
<BR>
probably be installing the actual kernel from somewhere else too (I don't
<BR>
really know how it's set up there - ask Randolph Chung, who's working on it)
