<EM>&gt; I will report if found something.

<P>We know why it's happening, but just not what's at fault yet.  So far, it
<BR>
appears that gcc is just generating unaligned things under very specific
<BR>
conditions.  But then again, I thought the same thing in the past when it
<BR>
turned out to be the code, so that avenue is being explored as well.  :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Well, I also wonder how I send a bug report which is architecture 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specific. Is this place(debian-alpha) is right for that?
</EM><BR>
<P>It's a good start.  Usually the BTS is a great spot also.  If the regular
<BR>
maintainers have an alpha problem that they can't solve, they usually
<BR>
write to us.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For example, neither current ldso(1.9.11-5.0.1) nor libc6.1(2.1.2-11)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has /usr/bin/ldd. (I could not find another alpha package which has 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ldd.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Should this kind of problem be reported here?
</EM><BR>
<P>In this case, yes, since I know about it :-)  The binaries that used to be
<BR>
in libc6.1's deb have been moved per policy to libc6.1-bin.  I know, there
<BR>
should be a dependency.  Joel (the maintainer of glibc for Debian) has
<BR>
already stated that he's going to fix this in his next upload.
