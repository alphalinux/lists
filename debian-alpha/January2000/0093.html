<P>
I have been having weird lock ups w/ my PC164, which has a 21164PC 500Mhz
<BR>
processor.  These are *hard* locks.  Sysreq won't respond.  There is no
<BR>
method to when the locks happen, or why.  I have beeen unable to track it
<BR>
down exactly, but here is what I have done-
<BR>
<P>*First I thought it was bad memory, but then I did a build of X overnight
<BR>
and nothing locked.. along w/ X, I re-built a large portion of the base
<BR>
system.  So, gcc compiling has been pretty much eliminated as a
<BR>
candidate for the lockup.
<BR>
<P>*My next suspect was IDE interface.  A few times it hard locked while
<BR>
accessing the IDE devices (1 hdd, 1 cd).  The onboard controller is the
<BR>
CMD646 (kernel driver avail).  I tried kernels w/ and w/o CMD646 compiled
<BR>
in.  I then disconnected all the IDE devices, and did not track it down.
<BR>
<P>*Next I thought it was the SCSI controller.  NCR53c875.  I ruled that out,
<BR>
by modularizing it, and using an IDE disk.  Locked up w/o SCSI controller
<BR>
initialized.
<BR>
<P>*I am now left w/ the video card.  It is a Matrox PCI G200.  The system
<BR>
has often locked up while in X, but not always.  The system will not boot
<BR>
if fbdev support is compiled in monolithically.  
<BR>
<P>Anyone with a similar system experience anything like this?  Anyone have
<BR>
thoughts on settings for the G200 in X?
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
