<P>
Paul,
<BR>
<P>Thanks for the quick reply and the helpful suggestions.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Do you have st as a module, or compiled into the kernel?
</EM><BR>
<P>I had it compiled into the kernel.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you use the module, take st out of /etc/modules, and try loading it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at a later stage (I have it auto-loading). Maybe with/without a tape
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; present makes a difference? Is the tape drive external? Is all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; termination as it should be? I.e. all the usual SCSI questions; SCSI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support on alpha's is nothing special (It Just Works), so don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concentrate on the fact this happens to be an alpha. Sometimes that can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be the cause of the problem, here I very much doubt it...
</EM><BR>
<P>The drive in an internal, and termination looks ok.
<BR>
<P>Following your suggestions, I put a tape into the drive and booted (kernel
<BR>
with driver compiled in) and it booted fine. Then recompiled the kernel
<BR>
with st as a module, /etc/modules set to auto. Booted without a tape in
<BR>
the drive and it hung at the same point as before, right after detecting
<BR>
the hard disk. After putting a tape in the drive and rebooting it detects
<BR>
the drive properly, boots up, and loads the module on demand.  
<BR>
<P>So it works, provided there is a tape in the drive on boot. My question at
<BR>
this point is whether this is related to the driver for the controller
<BR>
(qlogicisp). The doc for it says:
<BR>
<P>&quot;This driver works well in practice, but does not support disconnect/
<BR>
reconnect, which makes using it with tape drives impractical.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Not sure how to interpret this since the tape drive does work, the only
<BR>
issue seems to be booting from the hard disk without a tape in the drive
<BR>
(perhaps that is the impractical part.)
<BR>
<P>Since the machine boots fine from the floopy disk (root=/dev/sda2) is
<BR>
there any difference in the boot code (on the floppy vs bootlx on the
<BR>
hard disk) that loads the kernel? If it is a driver issue, then perhaps a
<BR>
request could be filed with the developer for inclusion in a future
<BR>
release? 
<BR>
<P>Again, thanks for the help.
