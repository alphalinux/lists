<P><EM>&gt; Yep. I should have posted to debian-alpha as well, since I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; running slink. The problems I have are that it can't stat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; svc.conf. I briefly checked with the libraries from 4.0F and I

<P>You do _have_ an /etc/svc.conf? In that case, how do you know it can't stat
<BR>
it?

<P><EM>&gt; I've seen this and I don't have ideas. The workaround has been to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; set junkbuster as an http proxy at 127.0.0.1 at the appropriate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; port (5865 for debian). Makes http work, at least.

<P>Yes, I run squid which makes everything work fine except Java applets that
<BR>
want to make direct connections somewhere. Putting each host you want to
<BR>
access in /etc/hosts also works, but is not very practical.

I've always been mad I know I've been mad like the most of us are             
Pretty hard to explain why you're a madman even if you're not mad
