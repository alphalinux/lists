<P><EM>&gt; Ok, I realize I've been posting a bit, and my posts have been fairly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nonconstructive, but this question is really killing me.  What's the deal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with libncurses4 regarding its nonexistence?  I've downloaded it (the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; debian source stuff anyway) and tried to compile it, but it claims it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't be compiled as a dynamic library. Is someone working on this?  Are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all of the packages going to be converted to libncurses5 fairly soon? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Finally, is an older version of libncurses4 available, like one that would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; satisfy the dependencies at least?  The one from stable is just slightly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; too old. I've scoured the net to the best of my ability but to no avail.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The only references on this list that I've seen are from March 1999 and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; refer to problems with libc6.1.  Some help would be very appreciated.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm about to work on this again.  It is VERY odd since one day, I uploaded
<BR>
libncurses4 debs and they were installed and the next day, they were
<BR>
totally gone from master.  It was waaaay too weird.  I've been trying to
<BR>
convert as many packages as possible, but it still won't be a
<BR>
substitution.
