<P>
I have a PC164 Motherboard which seems to have a problem sensing the Floppy
<BR>
drive (dva0 under SRM).  It activates the drive but there is no head
<BR>
activity and the SRM returns an error message which basically reads &quot;unable
<BR>
to open dva0&quot;.  Has anyone run into this situation and what was the
<BR>
corrective action taken.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I fear the onboard floppy controller may have a problem in the floppy data
<BR>
in line (internal problem) which is the reason the board is not reading the
<BR>
floppy.  I have tryed replacing the floppy drive (twice) and replacing the
<BR>
floppy drive cable (twice) with known good hardware.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing which has changed from the time the board was reading the
<BR>
drive until it stopped was the board was moved from a tower case to a
<BR>
rack-mount case.  Care was execised to insure there was not a possiblity of
<BR>
static damage during the move (anti-static workbench - grounded work area -
<BR>
ect, ect, ect) and the board was not subjected to any stress in the move
<BR>
operation (both the tower case and the rackmount case have a removable
<BR>
motherboard mounting plate so as to preclude physically stressing the
<BR>
motherboard).
<BR>
<P>Does anyone know if the SRM is capable of probing the ISA buss for a floppy
<BR>
drive controller card in place of the onboard floppy controller (one
<BR>
option).  If not then I have to figure out a method by which to get the
<BR>
machine booted.  I have an EB164 system as well and suppose I could move the
<BR>
system disk from the PC164 system, setup for booting from the hard drive,
<BR>
then move the drive back over to the PC164 but I would much rather have a
<BR>
floppy operational (for recovery if in the field as the machine is slated to
<BR>
be moved to another location for a T-1 connection to the Internet).
<BR>
<P><P>TIA,
<BR>
