<P>The thing is, Star Office was already ported to a few other archs (not
<BR>
64-bit, mind you, but it was ported), so it has a shot at being decent.

If Sun treats this like they treated the JDK, we've ALL got problems, but
<BR>
if they're kind enough to supply the full source, we could probably do the
<BR>
port ourselves and see how receptive they are about the patches.  If they
<BR>
say &quot;no&quot;, at least we tried and can probably distribute the patches
<BR>
outside of their acknowledgement.

<P><EM>&gt; There have been MANY articles on /. in the last two weeks on this, some imply it WON'T be a true Open Source license, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; others say it might. Guess, we'll have to wait and see...
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep.  It's anyone's guess since Sun is not known for being too generous
<BR>
with their licensing.
