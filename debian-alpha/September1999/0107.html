Hello,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a sx164 motherboard with a 533Mhz alpha. I installed redhat 6
<BR>
on it a while ago and since then decided I wanted my debian on it
<BR>
aswell. I got the proper rescue disk, and root1440.bin, dd the images on
<BR>
disks and tryied to boot.
<BR>
MILO boot fd0:/linux load_ramdisk=1
<BR>
It boots up all nice and happy and then asks me to change disks. I out
<BR>
in the root image and it give me an error saying that the image is too
<BR>
big. Even after adding the option ramdisk_size=32768 which should make
<BR>
the maximun ramdisk size 32 megs it give me this error. I have tried re
<BR>
writing the disks with no luck. I also tried a different kernel with no
<BR>
luck. I also tried to have the disk with the root1440.bin image be
<BR>
mounted as the root but I get a kernel panic because it can't mount the
<BR>
disk. The only thing I can find that could possible be the cause of all
<BR>
this is that during boot the kernel detects my floppy as a 2.88 meg
<BR>
drive, which is not and the alpha bios detects it as a 1.44 meg drive.
<BR>
Also the redhat kernel I used to install redhat did the same thing but
<BR>
its root disk worked fine. I have a cd so if someone can tell me how to
<BR>
boot of the cd and have it load a ramdisk that would be great. but
<BR>
anyhelp would be greatly appreciated.
<BR>
<P>Thank You
<BR>
matt
