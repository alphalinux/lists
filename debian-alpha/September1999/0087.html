Hallo !
<BR>
I recently got an CD-set containing Debian 2.1 for Intel and Alpha. I
<BR>
havn't used Debian before so maybe I made some beginners mistakes (I used
<BR>
SuSE/RedHat so far for many years). This is about my attempt to install
<BR>
Debian on my Alpha along with some problems/questions.
<BR>
<P>The installation went fine up to the point just before package selection.
<BR>
Unfortunately at that point I did not record the errors. Somehow it
<BR>
couldn't find a file which it was able to create (albeit slowly). I then
<BR>
went through the packages but was unable to select all I wanted because of
<BR>
some missing dependencies.
<BR>
<P>When I intended to start the installation it complained again about some
<BR>
file but I &quot;solved&quot; it by choosing single CD (instead of multi CD). I did
<BR>
not go through the package listing again. 
<BR>
<P>During install some &quot;odd&quot; things seemed to happen. GPM could not
<BR>
autodetect (I just Ctrl-Ced it and manually selecte PS2). Then messages
<BR>
like:
<BR>
<P>memory violation at pc=1555555db58 rp=155555fff4
<BR>
bad adress 00000fc9
<BR>
<P>appeard (the numbers may be slighly off). Suddenly (?) the installation
<BR>
finished with the message:
<BR>
halted too many errors
<BR>
<P>and I got an login prompt. Since I was quite exhausted I rebooted back
<BR>
into RedHat. Unfortunately I havn't found a way to convince AlphaBios to
<BR>
boot into Debian again since it is some rear partition on my IDE disk.
<BR>
<P>Machine type:
<BR>
LX 164 128 MB RAM, 1 SCSI, 1 IDE Disk, Debian on IDE.
<BR>
<P>Question:
<BR>
Is something wrong with the media ? I couldn't find simmilar experiences
<BR>
in the archives. Is multi-CD working on Alpha ?
<BR>
<P>I am probably willing to kill the SuSE partition and install Debian up
<BR>
front on the IDE disk.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for any help
<BR>
