<P>
Unfortunately, one of the users was using my AS255 earlier this week and it
<BR>
died a horrible death on him.  Entire file ssytem corruption :(
<BR>
He was creating a CD image, ... machine died, he couldn't bring it back up.
<BR>
Aboot boots, but can't get access to the /etc/aboot.conf file.
<BR>
I booted off the install floppies, and tried fscking the drives ..... 15 mins
<BR>
later after a fsck -y /dev/sdb4 ..... a desire to go home and continue
<BR>
studying for my exams was decided.
<BR>
My thoughts were the large file creation that was killing the 2.2.6 - 2.2.10
<BR>
(IIRC) kernels, but it ws running 2.2.5 which I presumed was free of this
<BR>
bug.
<BR>
Unfortunately, I will not be able tosee what happened with the apt, ld.so
<BR>
problem reported last week, as a full reinstall looks likely.
<BR>
<P>back soon,
<BR>
