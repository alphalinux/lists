</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; get nowadays? There's quite a lot of different motherboards out there...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I need scsi (pref. UW), network, and a couple of free slots for my ISDN
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and sound card (and room for maybe a second scsi card), Being able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; recycle the Matrox PCI I had would be great as well. Oh yeah, it's got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to be available in Europe, and of course cheap :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't know about having it fixed, but I believe the 164UX is the only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; board with UW scsi and networking onboard. I like this board but it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't have SRM, ARC, or AlphaBIOS. Only ARCSBIOS. If you need SRM or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AlphaBIOS, then the LX is probably the next best. I don't think the LX
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has onboard scsi and networking though.
</EM><BR>
<P>The LX doesn't have the onboard SCSI and networking, but SRM and
<BR>
AlphaBIOS make it more expensive than the UX. The UX has on-board
<BR>
ether, but I couldn't get the Tulip drivers that are necessary for it
<BR>
to work on a 100mbit connection, only 10mbit, so I ended up using a
<BR>
3Com card. The UX also has a good UW SCSI controller, as well as more
<BR>
RAM banks and PCI slots, so if that's important, the UX is a better
<BR>
board. However, it's pretty much impossible to use any OSes other than
<BR>
NT and Linux on the UX because ARCSBIOS is pretty much only designed
<BR>
for NT (i.e., forget that nice new Tru64 offering from Compaq and
<BR>
forget *BSD).
