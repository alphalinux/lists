Hi,
<BR>
<P>I am having a wee bit of trouble with installing slink on a Jensen.  Having
<BR>
been through many trials and tribulations, using the faqs at alphalinux.org
<BR>
and ftp.digital.com i eventually have scrapped the idea of booting from
<BR>
hard disk that both the faq's reccomend, and decided to boot initially from
<BR>
CD.. which works nicely.  However once I get to the aboot prompt and type
<BR>
the following (which i think is right) then I hit problems....
<BR>
<P><EM>aboot&gt;&gt;  /boot/jensen/linux root=/dev/fd0 load_ramdisk=1 prompt_ram
</EM><BR>
<P>aboot: booted_dev='scsi 1 6 0 0 400 0 jens-io', guessing boot_device
<BR>
= 'scd0'           &lt;-- I guess this means it is booting from the scsi cd
<BR>
which is fine
<BR>
aboot: loading plain /boot/jensen/linux ...
<BR>
aboot: unexpected object file format 137631
<BR>
aboot: loading compressed /boot/jensen/linux ...
<BR>
<P>unzip : unknown compression method
<BR>
&lt;-- And here it has issues with the way the kernel is compressed.
<BR>
<P>then it goes back to the aboot prompt.
<BR>
<P><P>So.. the kernel compression seems to be the issue, but the kernel is just
<BR>
the standard CD image one, the CD that the system has just booted from in
<BR>
fact.
<BR>
Am I doing something silly?  Like not putting a parameter on the boot
<BR>
command in aboot?
<BR>
Can anyone give me some helpful pointers or even a complete set of docs for
<BR>
the version of aboot which is on the slink cd??
<BR>
<P>Thanks in advance!
<BR>
<P>Patrick
