Hardware:
<BR>
- Alphastation 255/300 (avanti), with on-board Symbios 810a.
<BR>
- Tekram DC390U2B (wide fast-40 lvd based on Symios 895).
<BR>
- IBM DDRS hard drive (wide fast-40 lvd).
<BR>
<P>Software:
<BR>
- SRM 6.something (a 1996 version)
<BR>
- Linux 2.2.12.
<BR>
- Tried with both ncr and sym drivers, even in safe:y mode.
<BR>
<P>SRM:
<BR>
- There's a setting named pci_parity; it can be set to on, off or sniff (?).
<BR>
<P>With this configuration, I get an error rate in the order of 10^-9 (1 wrong
<BR>
bit out of 10^9 bits). Some errors seem quite reproducible, some are
<BR>
transient.
<BR>
With pci_parity set to on, the system crashes back to SRM on error, and
<BR>
becomes wildly unstable: a new boot most of the times hangs the machine.
<BR>
With pci_parity off or sniff, the system carries on the wrong data without
<BR>
notice.
<BR>
<P>The same controller and hard disk, installed in an Intel-based PC, work
<BR>
perfectly.
<BR>
<P>Substantial differences are: the on-board BIOS is NOT run on the Alpha
<BR>
machine; the PCI parity setting is not available for configuration (and,
<BR>
in fact, I don't know it).
<BR>
<P>My hypotheses are:
<BR>
- some sort of initialization is performed by the controller BIOS but not
<BR>
by the Linux driver
<BR>
- some sort of PCI level incompatibility between the Alpha PCI bridge
<BR>
(which is an Intel chip!) and the SCSI board
<BR>
- some sort of hardware breakage in my workstation
<BR>
<P>Anybody can help?
<BR>
<P>Would a newer SRM execute the SCSI BIOS (which is Intel code, of course)?
<BR>
Would that help?
<BR>
<P>Ciao, William
