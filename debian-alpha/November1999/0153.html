<P><EM>&gt;   (a) root.bin is too large to fit in 1.44FD. (about 1.6Mbytes)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         possily because of very large size of libc and binaries.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         In particular, we might have to reduce the libc.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is after compression?  'rootdisk.sh' is currently built at 3200k
<BR>
-- this was enough to build the sparc version, for instance...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   (b) aboot does not work well.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         In aboot prompt, I typed 'linux' but aboot said
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         'linux: file not found'.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm... well, you know that we're splitting root and boot disks now,
<BR>
right?  On the boot disk, is the kernel getting copied into place
<BR>
properly?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For (b), I tried to use aboot as possible as simple.  Using new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; floppy, I just did 'e2writeboot /dev/fd0 /boot/bootlx', mounted it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and copied kernel in name of 'linux', but aboot cound not find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kernel too.  (Actually aboot was loaded, but aboot seemed to fail to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; find kernel)
</EM><BR>
<P>I dunno the aboot stuff very well -- I've never had an Alpha to play
<BR>
with...  I guess you could ask the alpha folks.  rescue.sh should be
<BR>
the one building the rescue disks for you -- you shouldn't have to do
<BR>
it manually.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I do not have CVS write access to the boot-floppies tree.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If there is any way to apply for Debian developer, I would like to know.
</EM><BR>
<P>Are you asking for boot-floppies write access?  I don't have any
<BR>
control over new-maintainer but I can add people who are *not* debian
<BR>
developers to have write access to boot-floppies.  I would prefer if
<BR>
you first send a patch to this list for review before you commit stuff
<BR>
if you're new to all this though, at least for the first round...
<BR>
<P>If you have an account on va, you already can use that for write
<BR>
access..
