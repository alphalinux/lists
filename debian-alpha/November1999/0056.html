<EM>&gt; good to see another one of these around.  I have an AS255/233 ;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have snipped out most of your email and replied to all of it here:.

<EM>&gt; I am only using the built in ncr-810a on the mobo.  I can't comment on the

<EM>&gt; Tekram..... Theyre may be a bug in the kernel driver&gt;  Can anyone else comment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on this??
</EM><BR>
<P>It is possible but not quite probable: it works very well with the onboard
<BR>
810 chip, and it works (same kernel version) on Intel.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; SRM-6.xxxx  update it!  There are a couple of bugs with the older versions.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't remember what they were, but they did have PCI stuff in them, so that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *may* be what's affecting you.  This may also be what's giving you those nice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; messages with the pci_parity option.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm in the process of upgrading it; I've just stopped burning a defective
<BR>
floppy :(
<BR>
I'll try AlphaBIOS too.
<BR>
(not a great idea upgrading my firmware at 1 am, is it? :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ALso note, that the BIOS on the Tekram card will *never* ever be run by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SRM console.  AFAIK, this is only a requirement for PooE-Cee motherboards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which have dumb BIOSes as opposed to the nice interactive features of SRM,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alphabios and the SPARC OpenPROM.
</EM><BR>
<P>Uhm. Of course we don't need no INT 13 emulation or the like, but... some
<BR>
init to the hardware by the manufacturer wouldn't hurt.
<BR>
And, AlphaBIOS has an option about SCSI BIOS emulation (none/some/all);
<BR>
didn't test it yet.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Substantial differences are: the on-board BIOS is NOT run on the Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; machine; the PCI parity setting is not available for configuration (and,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in fact, I don't know it).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which PCI parity option are you talking about here?  In the kernel source?
</EM><BR>
<P>In the motherboard BIOS setup (equivalent to the one in SRM or AlphaBIOS).
<BR>
Currently I don't really know wether the PC mb implements PCI parity or not
<BR>
(but this isn't the problem, I suppose).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Just out of interest, how far through the boot/install process are you?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Just checking for any possible problems with you config/system.
</EM><BR>
<P>I had a working potato installation on a small disk connected to the 810;
<BR>
then I bought the new controller and disk and added them (still booting
<BR>
from the 810); currently I moved the new ctrl/disk to the PC and use them
<BR>
via NFS, having boot and root on the small disk.
<BR>
<P>I'll post a report after upgrading the firmware.
<BR>
<P>Ciao, William
