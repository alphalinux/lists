I'm running Debian (on a DEC Multia), although am fairly new to alphas and
<BR>
linux. However, after installing the stable version from CD-ROM, i couldn't
<BR>
find a working web browser. One just disappeared and another seemed to be
<BR>
loading the information (modem LEDs were blinking) but continued to show a
<BR>
black screen and never showed the web pages.
<BR>
<P>I eventually got sick of the one that just vanished whenever it felt like it
<BR>
and so decided to look for a new browser. I heard Mozilla is the go, so i
<BR>
downloaded it only to find it required other packages, so i downloaded them
<BR>
aswell. Unfortunately i think i ended up with half an original
<BR>
kernel(stable?) and half a new kernel(unstable?) as linux wouldn't work
<BR>
properly after installing the files Mozilla needed. I then couldn't seem to
<BR>
step back down to the original files as 'dselect' seems only to support
<BR>
upgrading not downgrading (unless you completely remove the package and then
<BR>
reload the original version).
<BR>
<P>So after reloading the stable version from the beginning i attempted to
<BR>
completely upgrade to unstable version (downloaded approx 200Mb) so as to be
<BR>
able to have a useable browser. I had memory errors during the configuration
<BR>
of the new packages (every time it was modifying the 'menu's) but eventually
<BR>
got most of the packages configured.
<BR>
<P>--Now for my question (sorry about the preamble) --
<BR>
<P>When i rebooted i got (and still get) the following error messages (it
<BR>
nearly gets there...):
<BR>
<P>error in configuration file
<BR>
Not starting x display manger       (i always got this message...i think i
<BR>
know what it is)
<BR>
<P>INIT: id &quot;3&quot; respawning too fast: disabled for five minutes
<BR>
INIT: id &quot;2&quot; respawning too fast: disabled for five minutes
<BR>
INIT: id &quot;6&quot; respawning too fast: disabled for five minutes
<BR>
INIT: id &quot;1&quot; respawning too fast: disabled for five minutes
<BR>
INIT: id &quot;4&quot; respawning too fast: disabled for five minutes
<BR>
INIT: id &quot;3&quot; respawning too fast: disabled for five minutes
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;...etc            (this is the real problem)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;It just keeps scrolling on with these 'INIT' messages every 4-10 seconds.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;As i can't log in, i dont know what to do. I really don't want to reload
<BR>
&nbsp;everything again.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Also, surely upgrading to the unstable version shouldn't mean i have to
<BR>
&nbsp;download approx. 200Mb
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Any help would be appreciated...i didn't expect linux to tire me out so
<BR>
&nbsp;quickly.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Regards,
<BR>
&nbsp;David.
