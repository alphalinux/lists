<P>
first of all, thanks a lot for all the people who replied.
<BR>
<P>if anyone would be interested in knowing about my experience with this,
<BR>
here's an account of my successes and failures.
<BR>
<P>the machine had two disks in the same support frame. i didn't bother
<BR>
untightening screws, so i just took the whole frame off the machine
<BR>
with both disks.
<BR>
<P>I connected the disk to the scsi bus and booted, but the kernel didn't
<BR>
recognize the disklabel (it said something like &quot;unknown partition
<BR>
table&quot;). naturally i didn't believe the kernel boot messages and I tried
<BR>
with fdisk to see the disk partitions (people in despair tend to suffer
<BR>
these kind of fantasies a lot) with no success. I spent some time thinking
<BR>
whether I had forgot anything, I even recompiled the kernel again (I thought
<BR>
I might had forgot to do &quot;make dep&quot;, who knows?...)
<BR>
<P>I finally considered myself defeated but, just for the fun of it,
<BR>
decided to try to use the other disk. guess what, the kernel liked that
<BR>
one. it reported the partitions on boot, fdisk had no problems in
<BR>
reading the disklabel and printing the partitions on the screen and
<BR>
the final test of mounting the filesystem (with the option ufstype=old)
<BR>
worked too. I could now list any directory inside it, view any file
<BR>
everything was fine. unfortunately that's not the disk I was interested
<BR>
in (cf. Murphy's law).
<BR>
<P>any hints on why one of the disklabels is read fine and the other is not?
<BR>
could it be a disk size problem (the disk that is not mountable is 9GB
<BR>
while the other is 4GB)?
<BR>
<P>anyway, I finally solved my problem in a more obvious way (but not so
<BR>
challenging :-). I took the graphics card from the linux box and
<BR>
put it on the other machine. X failed with this new card, but that's ok
<BR>
I only wanted to be able to use the disk. of course I could have thought
<BR>
of this before, but the idea of being able to use a DU filesystem in
<BR>
Linux was so appealing!
<BR>
<P>sorry for such lengthy and boring story.
<BR>
cheers,
<BR>
Alfred
