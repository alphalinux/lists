<P>I agree, yet disagree.  While -mieee would definitely help alot of
<BR>
packages, it is much more than just a minor slowdown in many cases.  I've
<BR>
had software take an unusually longer amount of time due to -mieee.  Plus,
<BR>
to add that much overhead to the execution of every programme is just not
<BR>
needed in 95% of the cases.
<BR>
<P>As for compiling for the submodel, I'm assuming you mean for the machine
<BR>
type.  I wish we could (I have a 21164PC and would love to use that BMX
<BR>
instruction for once), but we can't due to the large amount of 21066's and
<BR>
21164's out there.  As I found out accidentally with glibc (I miscompiled
<BR>
it with alphapca56 as a target), things just won't run on other Alphas
<BR>
with differing processors if compiled as such.  I assumed that the kernels
<BR>
were providing some of the instruction set functionality for processors
<BR>
without them (albeit slower), but it does not.
