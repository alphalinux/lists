<P>
So I just got my new PC164 board all installed and put a eepro board in
<BR>
PCI slot 2 (64-bit) and a 3c595 in PCI slot 4 (32-bit) with a G200 in Slot
<BR>
1 (64-bit) and a Tekram 390F in slot 3 (32-bit).
<BR>
<P>The problem is that the 3c595 driver doesn't seem to work on my system. I
<BR>
installed the base system off of floppies but now I need ethernet to suck
<BR>
with the rest of it via apt-get. And the disks don't have an eepro driver.
<BR>
If someone could be so kind as to point me to a pre-built module for the
<BR>
eepro under kernel 2.0.36 (or a monolithic kernel with eepro support in
<BR>
it) for the PC164 I would be most appreciative.
<BR>
<P>The problem with the 595 is that I can load the module successfully,
<BR>
ifconfig the interface, even add routes... but it won't transmit or
<BR>
receive traffic. My Cisco 675 router shows the card flooding the network
<BR>
quickly with little bits of traffic. This, I can assume, is bad. For some
<BR>
reason, both the 10 and 100 mbit lights come on.
<BR>
<P>The eepro's leds come on just fine, but alas, the driver disk has no
<BR>
modules for it. And I can't build one, since I have no compiler. And I
<BR>
can't get a compiler until I get ethernet... Sigh.
<BR>
<P>Thanks in advance,
<BR>
<P><PRE>
