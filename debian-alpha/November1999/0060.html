</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get nowadays? There's quite a lot of different motherboards out there...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I need scsi (pref. UW), network, and a couple of free slots for my ISDN
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and sound card (and room for maybe a second scsi card), Being able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recycle the Matrox PCI I had would be great as well. Oh yeah, it's got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be available in Europe, and of course cheap :-)

<P>I don't know about having it fixed, but I believe the 164UX is the only
<BR>
board with UW scsi and networking onboard. I like this board but it
<BR>
doesn't have SRM, ARC, or AlphaBIOS. Only ARCSBIOS. If you need SRM or
<BR>
AlphaBIOS, then the LX is probably the next best. I don't think the LX
<BR>
has onboard scsi and networking though.
