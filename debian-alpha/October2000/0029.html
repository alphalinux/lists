FYI, it's not just egcs that's causing the problems when compiling Qt2.2,
<BR>
it's also binutils.  According to TrollTech, you need a binutils version
<BR>
that's EXTREMELY old just to be able to properly link Qt2.2 on
<BR>
Alpha.  I've posted a bug report on the binutils list, but I've received
<BR>
no replies as of yet.  Apparently, there are some function and/or variable 
<BR>
definitions which are being merged by either gcc or the linker (most
<BR>
likely the linker) when linking Qt2.2 as a shared library, which causes
<BR>
any binaries linked to the library to segfault on exit (see the gcc docs
<BR>
for the option '-fconserve-space' for reference of the problem).  I
<BR>
haven't had time to diagnose the problems further myself yet, though, and
<BR>
I'm not about to upload an ancient binutils since it would effectively
<BR>
kill support for some of the newer ports (ARM, sparc64, etc).
<BR>
<P>In short, this is a problem that should be fixed upstream in the
<BR>
toolchain.  The ICEs that you encounter while compiling Qt2.2 can be
<BR>
worked around by editing the configs/linux-g++-* files and removing the
<BR>
&quot;-O2&quot; optimisation.  The library will still fail to link properly (despite
<BR>
giving no warning of such), though.
