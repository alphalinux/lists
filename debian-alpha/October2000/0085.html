Hello fellows,
<BR>
<P>I have to migrate a DS10 from True64Unix to linux. My choice was for potato.
<BR>
<P>The debian/linux is on a second hard drive.
<BR>
As the server may not be down very long, the install procudure is done during 
<BR>
late hours, and it won't be in production before everything works correctly. 
<BR>
So for now, we boot tru64 on the first drive, and make corrections to potato 
<BR>
form time to time on the second drive.
<BR>
<P>I installed the OS one month ago, without problems.
<BR>
<P>During the last month, the tape-drive cable was finally installed on the 
<BR>
machine, still with tru64. After that, when I wanted to boot Debian, I 
<BR>
discovered after an hour that the OS would'nt discover the second hard drive 
<BR>
as long as no tape was in the tape driver. Can someone explain me why ?
<BR>
<P>Second problem is with the console a vt420 terminal on the serial port.
<BR>
<P>When I installed th OS, it worked fine. Since the tape Installation (I guess, 
<BR>
since nothing else has changed) the boot message freeses on the console when 
<BR>
the portmap daemon is booting. (I removed the portmap daemon from the boot 
<BR>
process, and the freeze occured after the network interfaces are setup).
<BR>
More, the text on the terminal seems to shake slowly, which I have never seen 
<BR>
before.
<BR>
I'm not used with working with terminals, as my experience is mostly on 
<BR>
smaller machines, But I installed a AS1000 without a problem. Can someone 
<BR>
point me to an explanation ?
<BR>
<P>Note that at that point, I am able to log in the machine from the network. 
<BR>
Except it is very slow before the login prompt. I suspect it may be because of 
<BR>
the autonegociation between the computer and the switch, which I'll fix 
<BR>
tonight. My two NICS are from DEC, model tulip.
<BR>
<P>And, finally, I'd like to configure that server as a mail gateway for all my 
<BR>
organisation, but without it habing any users. All incoming messages should be 
<BR>
redirected to our internal mail server, but it would also relay all mail for 
<BR>
the internet coming form our internal mailserver to the internet.
<BR>
<P>If I am not wrong, the internal mail server would be the MAIL_HUB, and the 
<BR>
server would be the smart host. Am I right ? Can someone poit me to clear doc 
<BR>
for that ?
<BR>
<P>Thanks in advance
<BR>
<P>Marc Dubrowski
