<EM>&gt; As it turns out, I had a Debian 2.1 (slink) alpha CD under my nose and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; e-mailed the package to him.  We'll see how far he gets.

<P>Ok.  It's not that KDE2 isn't ported yet, it's more of a compilation
<BR>
problem with Qt 2.2.  Seems that binaries linked against it are
<BR>
segfaulting on exit, which is unacceptible.  I just got word that one of
<BR>
the gcc snapshots might solve this, so I'm waiting to find out which one
<BR>
so that I can isolate the fix and perhaps backport it.
<BR>
<P>Qt 2.2 has been the bane of my existance for quite awhile now.  I know it
<BR>
seems that nobody is working on it, but I assure you that I work on trying
<BR>
to figure out the problem at least once per day.  As soon as we resolve
<BR>
the situation, you'll definitely start seeing KDE packages being uploaded
<BR>
:-)
