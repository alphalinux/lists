<P><EM>&gt; What is the difference between ld and ldd (I read that ldd is the

</EM><BR>
<P>I think you're thinking of ld-linux.so (dynamic
<BR>
linker). Basically, it handles, in simple terms, runtime linking
<BR>
to shared libs.  When you compile a shared binary, it most likely uses
<BR>
functions from other libs (printf(), et.al).  What ld-linux.so does is try
<BR>
to load those functions from the other libs that the shared binary is
<BR>
linked to.  This is opposed to compiling a static binary, which directly
<BR>
includes the functions in the binary itself (meaning larger binaries, but
<BR>
they do not rely on other libs).
<BR>
<P>To summarise ld, I must quote the docs since they really do describe it
<BR>
best:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`ld' combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their
<BR>
data and ties up symbol references. Usually the last step in compiling
<BR>
a program is to run `ld'.
<BR>
<P>Basically, ld actually massages the object files (.o) into an executable
<BR>
binary.  This process can include making sure that the binary's external
<BR>
symbol locations can be resolved (and where to find them) in the case of
<BR>
shared binaries, or actually including the external functions in the final
<BR>
binary in the case of static binaries.  If you want some good ld info,
<BR>
check the texinfo docs ('info ld').  I don't mean to sound like I'm saying
<BR>
&quot;RTFM&quot; in a negative way, but it really does summarise ld better than I
<BR>
could.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What does this error message mean (what is this linker script file?):
</EM><BR>
<P>Linker scripts basically describe how to perform the linking process to
<BR>
ld.  Here's another quote from the ld docs:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of the linker script is to describe how the
<BR>
sections in the input files should be mapped into the output file, and
<BR>
to control the memory layout of the output file.  Most linker scripts
<BR>
do nothing more than this.  However, when necessary, the linker script
<BR>
can also direct the linker to perform many other operations, using the
<BR>
commands described below.
<BR>
<P>Linker scripts are VITAL to the operation of the linker.  Many of us have
<BR>
some custom linker scripts laying around for various specialised
<BR>
tasks.  On Alpha, the most common and well-known is the one that is used
<BR>
when -taso is passed to ld (reorients the resulting binary to a 32-bit
<BR>
space).  If ld is claiming that it can't find the script, you may want to
<BR>
check /usr/lib/ldscripts to see if you can find the script name somewhere
<BR>
in there.  The default binutils installation on Alpha should have
<BR>
these files in /usr/lib/ldscripts:
<BR>
alpha.x
<BR>
alpha.xn
<BR>
alpha.xu
<BR>
elf64alpha.xbn
<BR>
elf64alpha.xr
<BR>
elf64alpha.xu
<BR>
alpha.xbn
<BR>
alpha.xr
<BR>
elf64alpha.x
<BR>
elf64alpha.xn
<BR>
elf64alpha.xs
<BR>
<P>If you have any more questions about binutils, let me know (I'm the
<BR>
binutils maintainer for Debian, fyi, and have been working on the Alpha
<BR>
port for years now).
