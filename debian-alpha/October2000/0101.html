<EM>&gt; &gt; ummm...I never thought of trying my v3 card but if you havn't picked up

<EM>&gt; &gt; a card by early next week I'll give it a shot...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ok, great.  I doubt I'll have one by then since finding a non-AGP card in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this town is very tough (and no money to have one shipped out with any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expediency).  I'll let you know when I get the package finished.  I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gotten glide3 to build ok, but am trying to get the device3dfx maintainer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to update his sources before doing any real uploads (the current ones in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; woody are circa 9 months old and therefore too old to build on Alpha).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm also trying to figure out just what I want to build and how.  I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'll start off with just the &quot;h3&quot; target (V3's) and will add the others as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can test them.  So far, I haven't even heard of a V4 or V5 being used in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an Alpha...
</EM><BR>
<P>I have a voodoo5 here at the office that I've used in the UP1100....the
<BR>
Xserver and glide stuff seems to still be under heavy development....at
<BR>
least that was my impression about a month ago. IMHO h3 would be best for
<BR>
the moment.
