<P><EM>&gt; During the last month, the tape-drive cable was finally installed on the

<EM>&gt; machine, still with tru64. After that, when I wanted to boot Debian, I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discovered after an hour that the OS would'nt discover the second hard drive 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as long as no tape was in the tape driver. Can someone explain me why ?
</EM><BR>
<P>I vaguely recall reading something like this, it was some bug or so
<BR>
in the scsi host adapter driver. What adapter is it? maybe not probing
<BR>
multiple LUNs will also help (kernel config option).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Second problem is with the console a vt420 terminal on the serial port.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When I installed th OS, it worked fine. Since the tape Installation (I guess, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since nothing else has changed) the boot message freeses on the console when 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the portmap daemon is booting. (I removed the portmap daemon from the boot 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; process, and the freeze occured after the network interfaces are setup).
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds more like a name resolving timeout issue. Anything in the way
<BR>
of DNS servers changed, and not updated in the system?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; More, the text on the terminal seems to shake slowly, which I have never seen 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not used with working with terminals, as my experience is mostly on 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; smaller machines, But I installed a AS1000 without a problem. Can someone 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point me to an explanation ?
</EM><BR>
<P>The shaking of text on a vt420 isn't something linux can influence :-)
<BR>
You usually see this when the terminal is next to another device (e.g.
<BR>
another terminal, monitor, or power supply of some computer), and the
<BR>
(magnetic) interference from that other device is deflecting the
<BR>
electron beam.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Note that at that point, I am able to log in the machine from the network. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Except it is very slow before the login prompt. I suspect it may be because of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the autonegociation between the computer and the switch, which I'll fix 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tonight. My two NICS are from DEC, model tulip.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, this is probably also due to a name resolving timeout. You
<BR>
connect from another system, and the debian system wants to know
<BR>
what the name of that other system is (e.g. for logging and/or
<BR>
tcp wrappers), and that fails. Check your nsswitch.conf, resolv.conf,
<BR>
/etc/hosts, ...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And, finally, I'd like to configure that server as a mail gateway for all my 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organisation, but without it habing any users. All incoming messages should be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; redirected to our internal mail server, but it would also relay all mail for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the internet coming form our internal mailserver to the internet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If I am not wrong, the internal mail server would be the MAIL_HUB, and the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; server would be the smart host. Am I right ? Can someone poit me to clear doc 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for that ?
</EM><BR>
<P>It's not quite like that. The server is not the smart host, but the
<BR>
smart user host. It's something that is very easily done with exim
<BR>
(the standard mailer with debian), see the exim FAQ (either in the
<BR>
exim-doc package or on the www.exim.org website).
