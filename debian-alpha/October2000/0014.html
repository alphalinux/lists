<P>
I have already sent this question to the disribution list some weeks ago
<BR>
but, unfortunately, I could not connect with my news system to see if
<BR>
somebody replied to me. Thanks in advance for any help!
<BR>
<P>I am trying to install Debian 2.2 in an AlphaStation 200/4 166 MHz, booting
<BR>
from a CD-ROM through the SMR console.
<BR>
<P>I 'succeeded' in making a first installation, but several things did not
<BR>
work okay. For example, the system was unable to start X and it also
<BR>
reported some problems with the mouse. I tried to solve these problems by
<BR>
reconfiguring the system using xf86config, but I did not obtain any result.
<BR>
<P>Therefore, I decided to reinstall Debian 2.2 and I am now having problems
<BR>
with the installation itself:
<BR>
<P>At the step 'Make Linux Bootable Directly From the Hard Disk', the systems
<BR>
fails and reports:
<BR>
<P>'... aboot was unable to install. Most likely this is because your first
<BR>
partition overlaps the area where aboot was written'.
<BR>
<P>However, this is not true, since at the step of partitioning my hard drive,
<BR>
I started the first partition on the 2nd cylinder, according to the
<BR>
instructions of the installation program:
<BR>
<P>'... because aboot second-stage bootloader must occupy the first sector of
<BR>
the disk, you will need to leave about  1Mb of empty space before the first
<BR>
partition. On most of drives, it should suffice to start the 'a' partition
<BR>
at cylinder 2'
<BR>
<P>And indeed it sufficed the first time I installed Debian 2.2!
<BR>
<P>I would appreciate very much any help to overcome this problem. Many thanks.
<BR>
