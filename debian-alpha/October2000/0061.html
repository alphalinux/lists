Hi,
<BR>
<P>Ian, thanks for your help.  I had dpkg 1.4.0.31 and libc6.1 2.1.3-10, so
<BR>
both newer than the lchown change (that happened at dpkg 1.4.0.25,
<BR>
according to the changelog).
<BR>
<P>My kernel was ancient: 2.0.34.  So I grabbed the source for 2.2.17pre6
<BR>
from the source directory, built it and rebooted - and got a complete and
<BR>
utter crash.
<BR>
<P>Any ideas?  I'm afraid I used to be competent at this sort of thing, but
<BR>
I'm long out of practice.  My milo is from kernel 2.0.30, which could be a
<BR>
problem - could it?  I didn't apply any patches at all - I just took the
<BR>
.orig.tar.gz file; could that be the trouble?  (I take it there aren't any
<BR>
separate alpha patches any more ...).
<BR>
<P>This is what happened:  when I did a shutdown -r, it crashed when jumping
<BR>
to the kernel.  When rebooting through milo, milo kept rerunning itself,
<BR>
and I never got to the kernel ...
<BR>
<P>Oh, my 2.0.34 kernel with new dpkg/libc is also doing some very odd
<BR>
things, like the date is 1970, and I've been getting lots of messages
<BR>
starting `&lt;sc' (but that isn't dpkg/libc, as I've been getting them for a
<BR>
while ...).
<BR>
<P>Any help here much appreciated ...
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
<P>Nikhil.
