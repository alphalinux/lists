<P>
<EM>&gt; My kernel was ancient: 2.0.34.  So I grabbed the source for 2.2.17pre6
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from the source directory, built it and rebooted - and got a complete and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; utter crash.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm long out of practice.  My milo is from kernel 2.0.30, which could be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things, like the date is 1970, and I've been getting lots of messages
</EM><BR>
<P>i had similar problems with my alpha for a while.  (couldn't boot new
<BR>
kernels from my 2.0.30 milo disk, which i'd had since i got the
<BR>
machine)... the fix was to reinstall and make it boot from SRM, &quot;the way
<BR>
it should be&quot;.... :)
<BR>
<P>check your date in the hardware, and also make sure that the system knows
<BR>
how your date is set... there are often multiple methods and possible
<BR>
offsets.
