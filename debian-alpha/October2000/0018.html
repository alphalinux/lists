<EM>&gt; Thanks.  My point to him was that, other than the changelogs, there is

<EM>&gt; nothing to denote that the upload is for potato as well.  Guess it doesn't
</EM><BR>
<P>Argh, now I understand. It was uploaded to woody (as well, but you
<BR>
didn't realize that, you only saw it appear in woody) and you
<BR>
built it (on woody of course :) and uploaded as usual. And the
<BR>
changelog happened to say &quot;stable unstable&quot; so it also got installed
<BR>
into potato. I didn't realize what exactly had happened at first.
<BR>
In this case I *do* find it very curious that the other (auto)builders
<BR>
had no trouble about linking to the wrong version of libs; that would
<BR>
mean that either they explictly only upload to unstable (overriding
<BR>
what's in changelog) or that those machines are out of date. I assume
<BR>
the first (that's what the alpha autobuilder does as well, or at least
<BR>
did, which is why potato got left behind when it got frozen, and
<BR>
packages were being uploaded to &quot;frozen stable&quot;).
