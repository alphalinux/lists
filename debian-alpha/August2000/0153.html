</EM><BR>
<P>The 2.4.0-test kernel series have rarely compiled for me, mostly due to
<BR>
changes only being done on one arch rather than across the board.  I
<BR>
haven't tried using make-kpkg (in the computer world, I'm an old dog and
<BR>
have a hard time learning new tricks mid-stream :-P), but can look into
<BR>
the problems once 2.4 goes stable.  Sorry I cannot assist in fixing that
<BR>
at the moment, but system stability is paramount on my system right now
<BR>
(where alot of the woody compilation occurs).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  1. make-kpkg clean removes arch/alpha/vmlinux.lds,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even if mach archdep makes it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  2. removing 'rm -f arch/alpha/vmlinux.lds' from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; makefile allows the compilation to proceed further,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but it still fails
</EM><BR>
<P>This seems like it should be easy to fix.  I'll look into it sooner than I
<BR>
mentioned above since it seems like it should be trivial to fix.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Any suggestions would be great since i have usb
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; devices just begging to be used
</EM><BR>
<P>In almost every instance, I've been unable to compile a 2.4.0-test kernel
<BR>
without making patches.  Honestly, I'm afraid to even look at the state of
<BR>
USB code WRT using on Alpha.  My experience with the kernel folk is
<BR>
quickly becoming sour again since it seems that even IA64 is getting more
<BR>
attention by kernel developers than any other platform.  I hate to say it,
<BR>
but it's getting back to the point where ports are second-class citizens
<BR>
in the kernel world again.  It's frustrating for those of us that are left
<BR>
to support the ports, but still a worthy project, IMO.  Not to get
<BR>
political, but I wish Linus and Alan would actually use the Alphas that
<BR>
have been given to them rather than letting them collect dust...
<BR>
<P>Ok...frustration vented...
<BR>
<P>Which test kernel are you trying and what error are you getting if you try
<BR>
to compile it &quot;the old fashioned way&quot;?  I can probably come up with a
<BR>
patch to at least get you through compilation (and most likely will get
<BR>
the kernel booting).  I still have some of my previous test patches, but I
<BR>
doubt they'll be much help at this point since most of the changes I made
<BR>
were already fixed upstream.
