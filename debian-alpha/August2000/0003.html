<P><EM>&gt; Has anyone got the gnomeicu package patched yet?  If

<P>Yes, it's been patched, but hasn't been uploaded yet.  I'm working on
<BR>
getting the fixed version (including source) into potato, but the
<BR>
maintainer seems to have disappeared and not replied to my emails.
<BR>
<P>On a good note, the release manager knows that we have a patch and that
<BR>
I'm waiting for it to be addressed by the maintainer, so I may get to NMU
<BR>
it soon.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Also on a separate note, i downloaded the Mozilla M16
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deb from woody, and it segfaults every time it loads. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Has anyone else had this experience?
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm...no idea.  I'm still running potato until it's released, so I can't
<BR>
upgrade yet (since I've been making sure that potato is up-to-date).  I'll
<BR>
probably have access to a woody machine soon, though, so I may be able to
<BR>
test it.  Most likely, it may be related to mozilla relying on older
<BR>
versions of Gtk or something, though...Does it give any reason for it
<BR>
segfaulting?  (I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't fyi).
