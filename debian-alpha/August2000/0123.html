Hi,
<BR>
just for your info:
<BR>
I successfully compiled linus-2.4.0-test6 for my UP2000, which has
<BR>
been so far the first 2.4.0 series kernel working for me.
<BR>
Hint: make dep does not seem to run make archdep correctly, so vmlinux.lds
<BR>
is not build from vmlinux.lds.in in arch/alpha. Prior to make boot, make
<BR>
sure to run make archdep.
<BR>
<P>So far, I have not encountered problems. I would like to give 2.4.0 a
<BR>
try, since it fixes some things, I would like to see fixed.
<BR>
<P>Are there any good resons not to use 2.4.0 - aside from the obvious
<BR>
&quot;it's certainly not production-release yet&quot; ?
<BR>
I have some rather obscure races and stuck spinlocks in 2.2.14-16, which
<BR>
2.4.0 is apparently not suffering. Anything, I should be aware of ?
<BR>
( The &quot;rest&quot; of my System is a potato snapshot taken at a time
<BR>
between test-cycle 2 and 3 - unfortunately, I seems to take some time
<BR>
until the 2.2 release appears at my favorite mirror, and ftp.debian.org
<BR>
is overloaded, as expected. grumbl )
<BR>
<P>Anyway, just FYI.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
Thomas Weyergraf
