<EM>&gt; &gt; Argh, rpm is really that stupid that you have to tell it when it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; upgrading?! 
</EM><BR>
<P>There's more, if you pass RPM the -U flag (for upgrade) it will upgrade
<BR>
existing RPMs and install any you don't have installed. If you just want
<BR>
to upgrade what you already have installed you need -F (for Freshen!).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yep.  Worst thing is, it's still not guaranteed that it won't replace
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; configuration files upon &quot;upgrade&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>right, if you're lucky you end up with a configfile.rpmsave, which is
<BR>
better than nothing except when you reboot it then starts all of your
<BR>
daemons with the default config files not your config file.

<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm __so__ glad the debian alpha port was already usable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (although it wasn't &quot;release-ready for more than a year, and still better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; than the RH product) when I first got my alpha, and had fought with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; RH install for a month :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hehehe...yeah, it kinda sucked when I first came into it.  At the time, we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were still patching dpkg to get it to compile :-)  And I won't give the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; history on gcc.... :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Imagine what RH users will think of &quot;apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, as a RedHat user I can tell you that I'm impressed. I've started
<BR>
setuping up some machines at work with Debian (with some help from
<BR>
Chris...thanks) and so far things are looking good. I'm still learning
<BR>
about the wonders of dpkg and co.... but apt-get is just marvelous.
<BR>
<P>I must admit that RPM is better than nothing, but it looks like a toy
<BR>
compared to dpkg.
