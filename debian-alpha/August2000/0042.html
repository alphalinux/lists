<P><EM>&gt; There's more, if you pass RPM the -U flag (for upgrade) it will upgrade
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; existing RPMs and install any you don't have installed. If you just want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to upgrade what you already have installed you need -F (for Freshen!).
</EM><BR>
<P>I noticed that :-P  It's funny, though, how relatively undocumented RPM
<BR>
really is.  Having not used RPM for about two years before my last job, I
<BR>
couldn't remember anything about it other than 'rpm -i'.  Finding more
<BR>
docs on the real-world operation of RPM was akin to going to the dentist.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; right, if you're lucky you end up with a configfile.rpmsave, which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; better than nothing except when you reboot it then starts all of your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; daemons with the default config files not your config file.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, IF YOU'RE LUCKY :-P  I wasn't in the case of an inetd upgrade, which
<BR>
hosed one of our servers until I messed with it.  Luckily, I'm a good
<BR>
sysadmin and backed up all of the conf files before doing the upgrade.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Well, as a RedHat user I can tell you that I'm impressed. I've started
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; setuping up some machines at work with Debian (with some help from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Chris...thanks) and so far things are looking good. I'm still learning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the wonders of dpkg and co.... but apt-get is just marvelous.
</EM><BR>
<P>I know.  When apt first came around, I was amazed and it just keeps
<BR>
getting better.  It's sooooo easy to upgrade one package, a few, or an
<BR>
entire system, all while using the sources that you wish for package
<BR>
retrieval.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I must admit that RPM is better than nothing, but it looks like a toy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compared to dpkg.
</EM><BR>
<P>Dpkg could use improvement, but I personally think it's light years ahead
<BR>
of rpm.  We're really working on signed packages (which RPM has and is
<BR>
definitely good) and a few other things.  The developer tools are also
<BR>
much better, IMO (I really hate .spec files...is it just me or are they
<BR>
more difficult to deal with than the debian/ dir stuff?).
