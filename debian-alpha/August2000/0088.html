<P><EM>&gt; I'm having problems getting the floppy on my XL to work. I took it apart
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before, and I completely took the cabling out and everything. The floppy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cable that's in there has a direction notch on it (so it's harder to put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it on wrong), but the floppy drive doesn't have a border around its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connector, so I can put the cable in either way.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When I put it in one way, the drive light never comes on at all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When I put it in the other way, the drive light comes on when the system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boots up, and it stays on -- it never goes off.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In both cases, NT boots fine, I can log on etc. but I can never access the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; floppy drive. It shows the thing as working properly in NT's device
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thingy, and in the ARC console it detects it as a removable drive either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way I put the cable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My guess is that the drive's bad, but maybe it's the floppy controller? I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't know-- anyone with experience in this type of thing?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Oh, and I tried it with another floppy cable from an old PC as well.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well you could take the floppy out of the &quot;old PC&quot; and try it. If it
<BR>
works then you know it is the original drive. If it doesn't work then it
<BR>
could be the controller. AFAIK the controller for the 164LX is onboard
<BR>
so hopefully that is NOT the problem. Since you don't get any errors
<BR>
from NT (surprise!) it might be that the controller is ok but the floppy
<BR>
or cable is toast. $10 or so for a new floppy drive is a lot cheaper
<BR>
then replacing the motherboard.
