<P>
The 2.2 CD images are available from cdimage.debian.org.
<BR>
<P>At present, I'm not happy about the alpha &amp; sparc images, so until the
<BR>
images get linked to the 2.2_rev0 directory tree treat them as
<BR>
pre-release still.
<BR>
<P>The rest seemed to build fine though, and even if the alpha or sparc
<BR>
CDs change, they will be pretty close to what's there now, so rsyncing
<BR>
should be relatively quick.
<BR>
<P>Remember to use the -H option to rsync to preserve the hard-links
<BR>
between the potato_test &amp; 2.2_rev0 images, otherwise you'll waste a
<BR>
load of bandwidth and disk space.
<BR>
<P>The full CD mirror now takes a little over 14GB
<BR>
<P>ALPHA Problems:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;tools/boot/potato/post-boot-alpha was not executable, so I'm
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;rebuilding that now.
<BR>
<P>SPARC Problems:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I forgot that the sparc build needs to be done as root (or at least
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;fakeroot) so it can create the device files it needs, so I'll be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;rebuilding that next.
<BR>
<P>ARM Problems:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no Release files --- does anyone care?
<BR>
<P>If you're not actually running a mirror, please wait until this stuff
<BR>
starts appearing at mirrors, rather than going straight to
<BR>
cdimage.debian.org, otherwise it'll never get to the mirrors.
<BR>
<P>If you are running a mirror, then please use the pseudo-image-kit if
<BR>
at all possible, and if it's not possible then use a mirror that has
<BR>
more bandwidth (like sunsite.org.uk for example, who already have the
<BR>
binary-i386-1 and 1_NONUS images available)
<BR>
<P>If people could mention when they've got copies of the images, so that
<BR>
others can start mirroring from them, it might help spread the load
<BR>
more (cdimage.d.o is only a P166, so cannot stand too many rsyncs).
<BR>
<P>If things get out of hand, I may switch the password checks back on
<BR>
until the excitement dies down, so if that happens, and you're running
<BR>
a top level mirror, and you've not got a password, mail me.
<BR>
<P>Cheers, Phil.
