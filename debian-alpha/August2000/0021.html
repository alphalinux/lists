</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My limited tests on sparc, i386 and powerpc show no incompatibilites. I do

<EM>&gt; agree with a staging area, and that was my next suggestion. Problem is,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how do we stage for this to keep all C++ applications from breaking? Will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we need a libstdc++2.10-glibc2.1 like with the 2.0-&gt;2.1 upgrade had, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if so, what will I need to do to enable this?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've Cc'd alpha list to ask about the package name currently involved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (libc6.1) will that need to change to 6.2? What about libc0.2 for hurd?
</EM><BR>
<P>If it identifies itself as libc6.2, then yes, the package name should
<BR>
change to libc6.2 (if this happens on all archs, we can FINALLY be inline
<BR>
with the rest of the archs).
<BR>
<P>I'm also concerned about the C++ application breakage, so keep me posted
<BR>
on this.  As soon as potato is released, I'll upgrade my Alpha to woody
<BR>
and participate more, as per normal.  If I understand correctly, we'll
<BR>
probably need a transition package like a libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2, FYI.
<BR>
<P>Matthias, fyi, the last gcc snapshot that you packaged had bootstrap
<BR>
problems on alpha, so it wouldn't build.  I'm going to check the latest
<BR>
CVS snapshot probably tomorrow and see if things build ok (I'm getting
<BR>
access to a dual-processor EV6, so the build should take much less time).
