<P><EM>&gt; Slightly off-topic, but i'm a regular in #e on efnet,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the attitude of developers towards non-intel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machines is pretty low. It does look like we need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; raise the profile of alpha's, and work with the teams
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; working on other archs to get a better deal.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree...either that, or we just take over the port (which I'm becoming
<BR>
tempted).  I'm still hoping that one of them will realise &quot;just because we
<BR>
don't have one on our desk (or haven't plugged in the one that I have in
<BR>
the garage) doesn't mean that it's not worthwhile&quot;.  I guess &quot;the coolness
<BR>
factor&quot; of getting Linux ported to other archs wore off and those of us
<BR>
with more than one Alpha (I've got three and one that I loaned out) are
<BR>
left to fend for ourselves.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; IA64 - and how many people do they think will be able
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to afford one of these when they come out? All that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effort for a platform that hasn't even been released
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yet.
</EM><BR>
<P>I know.  I mean, I'm anxious to play with an IA64 (where did they pull the
<BR>
name &quot;Itanium&quot; from anyway), but I *KNOW* that I won't be able to afford
<BR>
one until long after they're initially released.  I still think that most
<BR>
people honestly believe that the pricing structure for IA64 chips will be
<BR>
akin to the current chips that are out...they'll be sadly mistaken when
<BR>
the time comes.  Even Intel has stated that the initial releases will be
<BR>
price-targeted for the server market.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have tried tests 4-7 and all of them have failed. To
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be honest, I don't trust myself to compile and install
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a kernel the non-debian way, so i'll wait until i can.
</EM><BR>
<P>I can help you through that if you'd like.  I would like to get a copy of
<BR>
your .config and any error messages that you've run into (especially
<BR>
unresolved symbols).  I just tried the test8-pre1 patch and got two
<BR>
unresolved symbols at the end (big shock: they're the same two that were
<BR>
missing since test5...that's progress for ya).
<BR>
<P>I can probably whip up a patch for my problems and yours in one fell
<BR>
swoop, assuming trivial to moderate issues are to blame.
