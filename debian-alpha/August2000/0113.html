Hi David,
<BR>
<P>I just wanted to thank you for doing a _great_ job on the new boot floppies.
<BR>
<P>I've done three installs from scratch now on different machines and they all 
<BR>
worked great (lx164, as255 aka avanti and as200 aka avanti).
<BR>
<P>lx164 was done from alphabios via milo. people (like me) with half-flash
<BR>
boards (like sx164 and lx164) with Adaptec controllers should stay with 
<BR>
alphabios as srm can't boot from Adaptecs (right, Jay ?). I'll file a (minor) 
<BR>
documentation bug against the alpha boot floppies doc. 
<BR>
<P>I just tried boot floppies. I didn't boot from a CD.
<BR>
<P>I'll just summarize the alpha specifics for lx164 (alphabios boot)
<BR>
step by step as a reference:
<BR>
<P>* upgrade your firmware as suggested in the alpha install docs. For alphabios
<BR>
it's easy just follow the NT instructions, you need a DOS formatted floppy.
<BR>
copy over fwupdate.exe and choose 'Alphabios upgrade' from your alphabios
<BR>
setup (for srm see below)
<BR>
<P>* copy linload and the milo for your machine to a DOS formatted floppy
<BR>
<P>* create an entry MILO in your OS selection setup of Alphabios 
<BR>
(ignore the warnings about the name). select A: as boot device and 
<BR>
linload.exe as bootloader
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
* boot MILO. at the milo prompt type the following (as described in the
<BR>
alpha install docs):
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; boot fd:linux.gz root=/dev/fd0 load_ramdisk=1
</EM><BR>
<P>* start installation 
<BR>
<P>* partion with a DOS label (as suggested in the advice during the install 
<BR>
process). make a small (2-5 mb) DOS partition (don't forget to set the type 
<BR>
of the DOS partition). 
<BR>
<P>* 'Make hdd bootable' did the magic and formatted the DOS partition and copied
<BR>
linload and milo from the boot floppy over to the hdd. Quite satisfying ;-)
<BR>
<P>* upon reboot enter the setup of the alphabios and create in os settings
<BR>
an entry before MILO called e.g. LINUX. set boot device to the first disk, 
<BR>
first partition, set bootloader to linload.exe, set secondary boot loader 
<BR>
arguments to 'boot sda2:vmlinuz root=/dev/sda2' and boot
<BR>
<P>* the rest should be Debian generic
<BR>
<P>alpha specifics for avantis (srm boot, note that with ^C you enter the srm
<BR>
console) 
<BR>
<P>* (optional but recommended) upgrade your srm firmware. this is slightly more 
<BR>
tricky than alphabios as there are no easy options you could use from a pure 
<BR>
GNU/Linux setup. my best option was to use the Digital Unix instructions and 
<BR>
use the mkbootfirm utility to produce a bootable firmware upgrade floppy. 
<BR>
Unfortunately mkbootfirm is a _dynamically_ linked DU binary so you need an 
<BR>
Linux alpha with DU libs.
<BR>
Jay, would it be possible to produce a statically linked mkbootfirm for the
<BR>
Linux community or even better the source code for mkbootfirm ? Any chance
<BR>
that mkbootfirm works on a i386/Linux platform ? 
<BR>
<P>* enter srm console and do a 'boot dva0'
<BR>
<P>* start installation
<BR>
<P>* partion with a BSD label (again as suggested in the advice), leave the 
<BR>
first cylinder empty for aboot
<BR>
<P>* 'Make hdd bootable' writes aboot to the first cylinder and it works, 
<BR>
that is, if you set bootdef_dev to dka0 and auto_action to boot in srm ;-)
<BR>
<P>So the alpha specific features work great if you follow the instructions.
<BR>
<P>I'll probably go over the alpha install docs in my copious free time (tm) 
<BR>
and propose a couple of enhancements but don't hold your breath.
<BR>

<BR>

What's the railroad to me ?
I never go to see
Where it ends.
It fills a few hollows,
And makes banks for the swallows, 
It sets the sand a-blowing,
And the blackberries a-growing.
                      (Henry David Thoreau)
