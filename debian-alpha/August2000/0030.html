<P>Very true.  Again, I don't think any changes need to be made to the
<BR>
current scheme if binary compatibility isn't broken with glibc
<BR>
2.1.95.  'libc6.1' has worked for alpha for (soon to be) two releases, so
<BR>
no need to change what's not broken at this point.
<BR>
<P>Let's deal with this when binary compatibility is affected by a glibc
<BR>
release (hopefully never :-P).
