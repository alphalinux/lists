<P>This &quot;... time seemed to jump around randomly...&quot; is exactly what I have

seen, for example, on UP1000 with a kernel compiled without RTC support.

If you will read with hwclock in a loop some of returned values will
<BR>
be correct and some will jump around.  How often one or another seems
<BR>
to depend on a phase of a moon.

<EM>&gt; Please try it for yourself :-) It was hashed out here in the list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think almost a year ago. It is definitely an incompatibility in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the potato libs which simply won't work on a 2.0 kernel as far as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time is concerned.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have no idea about libs in potato but I have seen &quot;jumping time&quot;
<BR>
happening too many times.  In particular in many situations updating
<BR>
'clock' (later 'hwclock') without touching anything else made a huge
<BR>
difference.
