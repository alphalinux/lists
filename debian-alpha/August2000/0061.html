Andy,
<BR>
<P>Those beeps probably indicated some kind of hardware problem. Judging from what
<BR>
you wrote ,
<BR>
probably a badly seated simm.
<BR>
<P>The other thing sound like you found the heat sensor , which basically give
<BR>
lower resistance when
<BR>
temperature gets higher , causing the fan to run faster. Shorting it out would
<BR>
cause the fan to
<BR>
run at full speed. If your CPU gets too hot , you should try to put that sensor
<BR>
somewhere in the airflow
<BR>
coming from the CPU. Mind you , alpha's do get quite hot. (running it at max rpm
<BR>
won't hurt either)
<BR>
<P>And yes , IIRC , a XL won't run without the case fan plugged in  ;-)
<BR>
<P>Good luck installing potato !
<BR>

<BR>
<P><P><P><P>hi everyone.
<BR>
<P>I got an old Alpha XL 266, and was going to install debian on it.
<BR>
Whenever I flipped the switch, it would beep at me a couple of times and
<BR>
not go anywhere. The keyboard LEDs would flash, the hard drive would spin
<BR>
up, the floppy would access, but nothing on screen.
<BR>
<P>Last night, I took the entire thing apart, cleaned up the inside (it was
<BR>
pretty dusty), and put it all back together again, and it works fine
<BR>
now. What was the beep for? Was some electrical thing being shorted
<BR>
somewhere? What did I miss?
<BR>
<P>(The other thing is, inside the case there is a power wire going to the
<BR>
case fan, and another pair of wires in the same area that are white. When
<BR>
I short the two white wires together, the power supply fan and the case
<BR>
fan both jump to much greater RPMs. Should I run it like this, or without
<BR>
the high speed? The CPU/riser board gets pretty hot to the touch without
<BR>
it. Also, before I opened the case, the wires had some weird taped
<BR>
contraption that looked like they were beig shorted out, but I couldn't
<BR>
tell--I cut it off.)
<BR>
<P>And is it cool that if the case fan isn't plugged into the power supply,
<BR>
when you flip the switch the power supply will kick up to +5V, then die
<BR>
down and the fan will stop? If the fan's plugged in it works perfectly.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I'm planning on installing potato now, wish me luck. ;-)
