<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; glibc, binutils and libstdc++, before an upload is done. Currently I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; don't know of any incompatibilities between 2.1 and 2.2, which should

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; affect libstdc++ ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; My limited tests on sparc, i386 and powerpc show no incompatibilites. I do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; agree with a staging area, and that was my next suggestion. Problem is,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; how do we stage for this to keep all C++ applications from breaking? Will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; we need a libstdc++2.10-glibc2.1 like with the 2.0-&gt;2.1 upgrade had, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; if so, what will I need to do to enable this?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I've Cc'd alpha list to ask about the package name currently involved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (libc6.1) will that need to change to 6.2? What about libc0.2 for hurd?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If it identifies itself as libc6.2, then yes, the package name should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; change to libc6.2 (if this happens on all archs, we can FINALLY be inline
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the rest of the archs).
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually I'de rather get rid of that altogether. Makes upgrading horrible,
<BR>
AFAICT. How would people cope with upgrades? libc6.2 would have to
<BR>
conflict/replace libc6.1, and that doesn't sound like an ideal situation.
<BR>
Given that 2.2 is pretty much binary compatible with things compiled on
<BR>
2.1, I don't think changing the package name is needed (should only be so
<BR>
if the soname changes, which would be expected if binary compatibility was
<BR>
lost).
<BR>
<P>Can we take ths chance to make alpha more like everything else and
<BR>
simply call it libc6? Obviously it's name will have to change anyway, and
<BR>
that's a whole lot easier than changing it on all the other archs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm also concerned about the C++ application breakage, so keep me posted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on this.  As soon as potato is released, I'll upgrade my Alpha to woody
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and participate more, as per normal.  If I understand correctly, we'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably need a transition package like a libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2, FYI.
</EM><BR>
<P>Right. Question is, how to do that. I'm not familiar with how it was done
<BR>
before. IMO, this time we should work on doing everything we can to get
<BR>
rid of it, really fast (binary only recompiles, etc..).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Matthias, fyi, the last gcc snapshot that you packaged had bootstrap
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problems on alpha, so it wouldn't build.  I'm going to check the latest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CVS snapshot probably tomorrow and see if things build ok (I'm getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; access to a dual-processor EV6, so the build should take much less time).
</EM><BR>
<P>There are a lot of patches not merged into the main tree. Sparc64 compiler
<BR>
wont build without them, and Matthias hasn't added them to the gcc-ss
<BR>
package yet.
