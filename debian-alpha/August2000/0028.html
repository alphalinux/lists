<P>Yes, that was the problem. It's been corrected in the CVS tree already so
<BR>
I'm trying a newer CVS snapshot.  So far, it built just fine, now I'm
<BR>
running the testsuite (ugh).

<P><EM>&gt; I am also concerned that 128 MB were *barely* enough to compile
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; libstdc++-v3, with stopping all daemons and stopping working... This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is really not good, especially since there are Alphas with even less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memory out there; I have no idea what to do about it, though...
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, that won't be a problem for me to build at all (the dual EV6 I have
<BR>
access to has 1GB RAM) and once it's built, it's built.  Most people won't
<BR>
want to recompile it themselves and those who do would probably have more
<BR>
RAM any way (fingers crossed...besides, on my old UDB, which did most of
<BR>
the work on slink, it took nearly a day to compile gcc anyway).
