<P><EM>&gt; Can't you simply add a dummy package called lib6.1 that Depends: or

<EM>&gt; can get rid of it but it would get the Alpha back in line with the

<EM>&gt; other archs. And there's not ever going to be a real libc6.1 anyway.

<P>Well, you can change the package name, but you must not change the soname
<BR>
or you are going to break binary comaptiblity with every other alpha dist
<BR>
out there. Our policy does say that the soname should be in the package
<BR>
name which means this scheme is somewhat against policy too..
