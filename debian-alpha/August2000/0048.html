<P>
I have a question about video cards and alpha machines.
<BR>
<P>I have a DEC AlphaServer 400 4/166 and right now the machine has the factory
<BR>
S3 card (894 or someting) installed in it. This card sucks and I am having a
<BR>
hard time getting it to behave under X. So I am wondering what my options
<BR>
for other video cards on this machine are?
<BR>
<P>Can I pretty much take a PCI video card and put it in this machine and
<BR>
(provided Xserver exists) expect it to work? Can anyone recommend a
<BR>
particular family of cards that are well behaved and supported for alpha? I
<BR>
have a spare 2MB ATI 3D Xpression kicking around (I think it is Mach64-VT or
<BR>
GT chip) and I would like to use that since I know it worked very well on a
<BR>
PC i had running linux.
<BR>
<P>Any information would be appreciated. thanks
<BR>
<P>Another question I have is the same as above, but sound cards. Can I take a
<BR>
SoundBlaster and put it in this machine?
