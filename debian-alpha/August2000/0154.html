<P>
Chris,
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; In almost every instance, I've been unable to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compile a 2.4.0-test kernel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without making patches.  Honestly, I'm afraid to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even look at the state of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; USB code WRT using on Alpha.  My experience with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kernel folk is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quickly becoming sour again since it seems that even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IA64 is getting more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attention by kernel developers than any other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; platform.  I hate to say it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but it's getting back to the point where ports are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; second-class citizens
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the kernel world again.  It's frustrating for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those of us that are left
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to support the ports, but still a worthy project,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IMO.  Not to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; political, but I wish Linus and Alan would actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use the Alphas that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have been given to them rather than letting them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; collect dust...
</EM><BR>
<P>Slightly off-topic, but i'm a regular in #e on efnet,
<BR>
and the attitude of developers towards non-intel
<BR>
machines is pretty low. It does look like we need to
<BR>
raise the profile of alpha's, and work with the teams
<BR>
working on other archs to get a better deal.
<BR>
<P>IA64 - and how many people do they think will be able
<BR>
to afford one of these when they come out? All that
<BR>
effort for a platform that hasn't even been released
<BR>
yet.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Ok...frustration vented...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Which test kernel are you trying and what error are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you getting if you try
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to compile it &quot;the old fashioned way&quot;?  I can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably come up with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; patch to at least get you through compilation (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most likely will get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the kernel booting).  I still have some of my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; previous test patches, but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doubt they'll be much help at this point since most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the changes I made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were already fixed upstream.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have tried tests 4-7 and all of them have failed. To
<BR>
be honest, I don't trust myself to compile and install
<BR>
a kernel the non-debian way, so i'll wait until i can.
<BR>
<P>Robert
