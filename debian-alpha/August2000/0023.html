<P><EM>&gt; Actually I'de rather get rid of that altogether. Makes upgrading horrible,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AFAICT. How would people cope with upgrades? libc6.2 would have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conflict/replace libc6.1, and that doesn't sound like an ideal situation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Given that 2.2 is pretty much binary compatible with things compiled on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.1, I don't think changing the package name is needed (should only be so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if the soname changes, which would be expected if binary compatibility was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lost).
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm...well, changing Alpha's libc package name would involve the same
<BR>
situation as if we all changed to libc6.2, at least on alpha.  We'd have
<BR>
to conflict/replace AND provide libc6.1 (to cope with older packages
<BR>
and/or non-Debian-offered packages, such as the compilers that I helped to 
<BR>
package for Compaq).  I don't think any of us would mind staying with
<BR>
'libc6.1' on alpha since were so used to it, so if binary compatibility
<BR>
isn't broken and we aren't changing the other archs' package name, then
<BR>
let's stick to libc6.1 on alpha as well.  The only time it really gives
<BR>
problems for me is when dealing with hard-coded dependencies, which
<BR>
shouldn't be around anymore anyway, IMO.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Can we take ths chance to make alpha more like everything else and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simply call it libc6? Obviously it's name will have to change anyway, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that's a whole lot easier than changing it on all the other archs.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wish I had been of importance enough on Alpha when the libc6-&gt;libc6.1
<BR>
change was made (I was still just getting started as a Debian
<BR>
developer).  I'm afraid it's a situation that we won't be able to change
<BR>
easily until the soname does change for glibc.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Right. Question is, how to do that. I'm not familiar with how it was done
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before. IMO, this time we should work on doing everything we can to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rid of it, really fast (binary only recompiles, etc..).
</EM><BR>
<P>Basically, we made the libstdc++ packages with the glibc version number so
<BR>
that we could differentiate what'd been recompiled and what
<BR>
hadn't.  Luckily, libstdc++ changed sonames at the time, so it kinda took
<BR>
care of itself after that, but if it hadn't, those packages would still be
<BR>
there.  I suppose we could do binary-only recompiles, which may make it
<BR>
faster, but it would be harder to track across all archs than if we just
<BR>
told all maintainers to upload new packages for recompilations to a
<BR>
staging area that autobuilders don't look at until their libstdc++
<BR>
packages are updated (we ran into this problem on Alpha before...had to
<BR>
recompile ALOT of stuff as binary NMUs since the autobuilder hadn't been
<BR>
updated, but was building the packages with &quot;recompiled under new
<BR>
libstdc++&quot; in their changelogs).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There are a lot of patches not merged into the main tree. Sparc64 compiler
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wont build without them, and Matthias hasn't added them to the gcc-ss
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; package yet.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm building the latest snapshot now on Alpha.  The problems that I noted
<BR>
appear to have been fixed (from what I can tell) since the last gcc-ss
<BR>
package was made.
