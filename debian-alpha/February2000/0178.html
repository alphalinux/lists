<P><EM>&gt; 1) Constant spew of unaligned access messages from all programs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    written in C++.  This is not acceptable for a release.  People are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    working hard (Jason did a great job of isolating the problem) on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    this but it may not be possible to fix it before release, and we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    cannot hold up other architectures for it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed.  In fact, I doubt we can/will fix it before that time,
<BR>
unfortunately.  I lack the time to really beat on a solution enough right
<BR>
now.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2) Many, many programs do not build correctly due to internal compiler
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    errors, or do not work correctly due to miscompilation or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    misoptimization.  I'm working on producing testcases for these bugs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    so that they can be forwarded to the gcc lists, but even then I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    doubtful that they will be fixed in the gcc 2.95.x release stream.
</EM><BR>
<P>Also agreed.  All compiler iterations for Alpha have had problems, mostly
<BR>
because Alpha really isn't an arch that is owned by a few million people
<BR>
on the average.  Also, because of some pretty widespread changes in the
<BR>
future of gcc, I doubt many more things will be done to 2.95.x.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3) Our C library can't even be built with the compiler we are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    shipping.  Enough said.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is not true at all anymore.  The appropriate patch has been included
<BR>
in Debian's gcc packages to allow glibc (and many other math packages) to
<BR>
be compiled now.  I'm going to get the new glibc packages compiled today,
<BR>
fyi.  Also, the reason that we don't autobuild glibc, gcc, and a few other
<BR>
packages is because of their importance.  If they should somehow be
<BR>
miscompiled or should have an unanticipated problem, the generated debs
<BR>
could trash all of our systems.  I've held up on compiling some glibc
<BR>
versions because of problems and, believe me, we ALL were lucky in those
<BR>
cases that they weren't autobuilt.  In other words, those packages deserve
<BR>
(rather than require) a bit more personal attention than the rest.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 4) We are not binary-compatible with Red Hat 6.1 and 6.2beta.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    (However as mentioned in an earlier message this is probably not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    our problem).  Aside from the big horrible problem of our libc
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    providing exception-handling symbols while theirs doesn't, C++
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    programs compiled on Debian can't run on Red Hat anyway since we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    are using libstdc++2.10.
</EM><BR>
<P>Great point!  I never thought of this and would break compatibility anyway
<BR>
(has anyone on -devel noticed that fact yet?).  I hear that RH6.2 is in
<BR>
the beta stages now, so I guess we'll have to check that out and see what
<BR>
they're doing in both regards.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In short, our system is in a mess due to circumstances entirely beyond
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; our control.
</EM><BR>
<P>True.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In every case, the culprit is obvious:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ****** GCC 2.95 IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL (on alpha at least) *******
</EM><BR>
<P>Argh! No.....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I would like to propose that the Alpha distribution revert to egcs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1.1.2 for potato, recompile glibc and all c++ programs to match, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leave gcc 2.95.x in woody, so that we can work on fixing the bugs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's ALOT of work and should really be discussed on -devel.  Keep in
<BR>
mind that when we started potato, RH5.2 was still out and we could never
<BR>
have forseen these events.  Also, I wish I could say that I kept a RH
<BR>
system around to check these things (if I did, I would've seen this
<BR>
already), but I can't.
<BR>
<P>On top of all of that, there are some real
<BR>
misconceptions floating around as to why we're using gcc 2.95 to begin
<BR>
with.  No, it's not because the version numbers should go up.  It's more
<BR>
because gcc 2.95 is technically a superiour compiler to egcs 1.1.2 and,
<BR>
believe it or not, provides better support for Alpha than before.  It was
<BR>
unforseeable that RH would base their distribution on egcs 1.1.2, but the
<BR>
big argument is, do we, as a distribution, use RH as a standard that we
<BR>
must follow or do we have our own development cycle?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It's okay that we put unstable software (such as CVS versions of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; glibc) in the unstable release with the expectation that they will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fixed by the time the next release rolls around.  HOWEVER, if these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unstable versions are NOT fixed, we MUST back them out!  It is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; irresponsible to our users to do otherwise.  We CANNOT continue to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assume that version numbers can only go up.
</EM><BR>
<P>Believe me, nobody here just expects version numbers to increase.  I'm
<BR>
waiting on the glibc maintainer to comment on our current situation before
<BR>
bringing the whole thing up on -devel.  I also wouldn't consider gcc
<BR>
2.95.x to be &quot;unstable&quot;.  EGCS 1.1.x had NUMEROUS bugs that we either
<BR>
worked around or caused us to not compile certain packages, but I would
<BR>
consider EGCS more &quot;unstable&quot; simply because it was a prerelease version
<BR>
of gcc to begin with (among other things).  Right now, there are no easy
<BR>
answers anyway and, if needed, I say we just opt to skip the release cycle
<BR>
for Alpha or at least postpone it.  I know it's never been done before,
<BR>
but why couldn't it be?
