<EM>&gt; &gt; Because the autobuilder only uploads (perhaps past tense?) to unstable,

<EM>&gt; &gt; debian-alpha: &quot;Autobuilder status&quot;.

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; But this doesn't explain why my hand uploads are being

<EM>&gt; rejected...hmmm....I'll go back and look at the thread...thanks!

<P>The problem is: the autobuilder has already uploaded e.g. foo 1.2-3 to
<BR>
woody, and you're trying to upload foo 1.2-3 to potato AND woody.  The
<BR>
installer finds that &gt;= 1.2-3 is already in woody, and rejects the
<BR>
entire foo upload.  Yes, it's not expected behaviour, but there _is_
<BR>
some logic in it :-)
<BR>
<P>So by editing the *.changes file to remove &quot;unstable&quot; from the
<BR>
&quot;Distribution:&quot; line (and resigning it) you can get the upload to work.
