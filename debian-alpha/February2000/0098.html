<P><EM>&gt; Greetings, and thanks for your work on the blas!
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks, but it's really not my work, Kazushige Goto deserves the credit.  I just
<BR>
spent a couple of hours plugging it in.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Have you by chance timed these routines against the atlas package blas?  Atlas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; automatically tunes the blas for your particular hardware, and is open source.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, but I'll give it a try; I suspect the Goto routines (dgemm in particular) will
<BR>
be at least twice as fast because he does some really interesting unrolling
<BR>
things, and it's written in very tight assembler.  You should see the inner loop
<BR>
of the gemm routine- it has exactly one add, one multiply, and two load/store
<BR>
instructions per clock cycle, hand-unrolled to 32 cycles, which totally maxes out
<BR>
the Alpha's theoretical performance.  (I'm not an assembler programmer, just know
<BR>
a little bit about the chip's operation, and read through his code once a while
<BR>
back.  BTW, the code is so well documented, it's worth the read even if you have
<BR>
no interest whatsoever in Alpha assembly.)  It's *extremely* difficult, probably
<BR>
impossible, to get near this level of performance from compiled code, even using
<BR>
Compaq's new FORTRAN Linux compilers.
<BR>
<P>In fact, his routine is twice as fast as the original assembler BLAS routines
<BR>
shipped by Digital!!  Compaq has included his routines in their CXML library which
<BR>
ships with their Linux compilers- with the author's permission for a GPL exeption
<BR>
of course.
<BR>
<P>There are Debian packages for the Q compilers and libs, but they're very
<BR>
non-free.  At some point I'm going to check performance of this enhanced GPL BLAS
<BR>
package against CXML, and also try compiling the regular BLAS with Q compilers, to
<BR>
see whether the free libs (they're still free if compiled by a non-free compiler,
<BR>
right?) are as fast as the non-free CXML.
<BR>
<P>I'll also at some point try to make a deb of Goto and Joachim Wesner's Free Fast
<BR>
Math lib for Alpha, which is not quite as fast as CPML, but (is free and) includes
<BR>
&quot;vectorized&quot; versions of sqrt, cos, sin which are substantially faster than looped
<BR>
calls to CPML (I think he said something like 12 clocks per argument, but I don't
<BR>
remember which function that was).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And what's better, it has hooks allowing the user to provide a small number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kernel routines to time against the others and possibly include in the finished
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; library.  In fact, a few others and myself are working on that right now for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; PIII, using the kni and prefetch x86 extensions.  We're seeing significant gains
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with these instructions, and hope to contribute them to atlas soon.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds interesting.  A bit beyond my understanding, but if there's significant
<BR>
vectorization, could it approach Alpha's 800 MFlops performance?  How many add/mul
<BR>
double-precision floating units are there on PIII?

<P>Thanks very much, I'll give these a try (probably in a week or two) and report a
<BR>
comparison, also vs. the non-free Q libs.
<BR>
<P>BTW, I haven't heard a reply to the legal question yet- &quot;This software is in the
<BR>
public domain&quot; is GPL-compatible, right?  If not, I'll have to take down the
<BR>
patches and debs. :-(
