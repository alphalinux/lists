Hi,
<BR>
<P>I've been doing a few things to make installing Debian on Alphas that boot
<BR>
from SRM firmware a bit more pleasant, and I'm wondering about how to
<BR>
proceed with a few things.
<BR>
<P>First, on MILO machines, the &quot;make the system bootable from hard disk&quot; and
<BR>
&quot;write a boot floppy&quot; steps are not relevant to the installation, as the
<BR>
details of MILO installation are, I fear, beyond the scope of dbootstrap
<BR>
(you either have to flash it into firmware or make a small DOS partition
<BR>
containing MILO and linload.exe), so these steps should not (IMHO) be
<BR>
present in the main dbootstrap menu.
<BR>
<P>However, on SRM machines, they are definitely relevant.  I've committed some
<BR>
patches to bootconfig.c and to the root.bin scripts to include the necessary
<BR>
aboot utilities and files in order to make SRM-bootable floppies and disks.
<BR>
<P>There are two things I'm wondering about:
<BR>
<P>1) dbootstrap needs to detect whether it has been booted from SRM or MILO,
<BR>
then adjust the installation sequence accordingly, neither of which I can
<BR>
figure out how to do.  (well, the former can probably be done by a 'dmesg |
<BR>
grep -q SRM' :) Can one remove/add steps from the main menu at runtime or
<BR>
does it have to be done at compile time?
<BR>
<P>2) dbootstrap also needs to run the correct fdisk program based on this
<BR>
detection - cfdisk cannot create OSF partition maps, so SRM machines must
<BR>
use fdisk instead.  I would also like to put up a dialog box explaining that
<BR>
you need to put fdisk into disklabel mode with the 'b' command (it would be
<BR>
nice if you could simply launch fdisk in disklabel mode - I might hack it so
<BR>
that this can be done), and start the first partition at cylinder 2 rather
<BR>
than cylinder 1 to leave room for aboot.  (BTW, the Red Hat 6.1 installer is
<BR>
very nice about this - it has its own partitioning utility, so it does all
<BR>
that for you automatically and transparently)
<BR>
<P>Obviously I could compile two separate dbootstraps, and make two separate
<BR>
root.bins, one for MILO and one for SRM, but I don't want to do that (it's
<BR>
bad enough that people have to deal with fdisk :P)
<BR>
<P>How should I go about this stuff?
<BR>
