<P><EM>&gt; The documentation does not mention much of ANYTHING that's helpful to Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; users.  Many, many people have asked for help on this list who wouldn't have had
</EM><BR>
<P>Unfortunately all Alpha documentation is in a similar state.  But ours
<BR>
is particularly bad, agreed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So, WHERE is the current Potato documentation, and HOW can one contribute?  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sent a patch for the slink documentation months ago which seems to have vanished
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into thin air.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you are a developer:
<BR>
<P>export CVS_RSH=ssh
<BR>
cvs -d :ext:&lt;your user name&gt;@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/debian-boot checkout boot-floppies
<BR>
<P>Otherwise,
<BR>
<P>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/debian-boot login
<BR>
&lt;hit return at the prompt&gt;
<BR>
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/debian-boot checkout boot-floppies
<BR>
<P>Subscribe to the debian-boot list, send patches there too if you don't
<BR>
have write access (all developers have write access).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It's frustrating to see some of the same questions come up over and over again,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to try to do something about it, and to be ignored.  In spite of all the work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being put into boot floppies, if there are bad docs, it really gives the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impression that Debian doesn't care at all about new Alpha users.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've been working on them a bit.  Don't worry, we won't forget about
<BR>
documentation (although my goal is to make the process of installing
<BR>
on an Alpha self-documenting to some extent).  Your contributions are
<BR>
certainly welcome :)
