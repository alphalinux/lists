Hi,
<BR>
<P>I've just done a fresh install of potato on the DS10 here at work, and
<BR>
I have some rather grave concerns about our readiness for release on
<BR>
this platform.
<BR>
<P>First, the good news (yeah, that's the wrong order to do this in, but
<BR>
oh well...): boot-floppies (as they stand in CVS - I'm putting off
<BR>
building a release for reasons I'll get into later) are *definitely*
<BR>
on track.  I dare say that they are already much better than the ones
<BR>
we released with slink, though that's not too hard.  Documentation is
<BR>
also coming along well I believe.
<BR>
<P>Now, the bad news:
<BR>
<P>1) Constant spew of unaligned access messages from all programs
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;written in C++.  This is not acceptable for a release.  People are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;working hard (Jason did a great job of isolating the problem) on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this but it may not be possible to fix it before release, and we
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot hold up other architectures for it.
<BR>
<P>2) Many, many programs do not build correctly due to internal compiler
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;errors, or do not work correctly due to miscompilation or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;misoptimization.  I'm working on producing testcases for these bugs
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that they can be forwarded to the gcc lists, but even then I'm
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doubtful that they will be fixed in the gcc 2.95.x release stream.
<BR>
<P>3) Our C library can't even be built with the compiler we are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shipping.  Enough said.  This makes it particularly hard for us to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deal with the latest rearrangements of the glibc dependencies since
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;glibc can't be autobuilt.  At the moment I'm in a tough situation
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here because I need to use my workstation for development, but many
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very important packages (gtk+ in particular) are uninstallable
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until I have new glibc packages that contain /usr/bin/ldd and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provide gconv-modules.
<BR>
<P>4) We are not binary-compatible with Red Hat 6.1 and 6.2beta.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(However as mentioned in an earlier message this is probably not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our problem).  Aside from the big horrible problem of our libc
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;providing exception-handling symbols while theirs doesn't, C++
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;programs compiled on Debian can't run on Red Hat anyway since we
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are using libstdc++2.10.
<BR>
<P>In short, our system is in a mess due to circumstances entirely beyond
<BR>
our control.
<BR>
<P>In every case, the culprit is obvious:
<BR>
<P>*******************************************************************
<BR>
****** GCC 2.95 IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL (on alpha at least) *******
<BR>
*******************************************************************
<BR>
<P>I would like to propose that the Alpha distribution revert to egcs
<BR>
1.1.2 for potato, recompile glibc and all c++ programs to match, and
<BR>
leave gcc 2.95.x in woody, so that we can work on fixing the bugs
<BR>
there.
<BR>
<P>It's okay that we put unstable software (such as CVS versions of
<BR>
glibc) in the unstable release with the expectation that they will be
<BR>
fixed by the time the next release rolls around.  HOWEVER, if these
<BR>
unstable versions are NOT fixed, we MUST back them out!  It is
<BR>
irresponsible to our users to do otherwise.  We CANNOT continue to
<BR>
assume that version numbers can only go up.
<BR>
