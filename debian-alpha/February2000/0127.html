<P>Argh!  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Could the cause of this be that our glibc is built with gcc 2.96 snapshots,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whereas theirs is built with egcs 1.1.2?  I say that they may be in the

<EM>&gt; wrong, because the glibc2.1 FAQ indicates that glibc2.1 is suppposed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; provide the exception handling symbols in order to prevent other libraries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from providing them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  Our first libc6.1 packages were built with egcs 1.1.x, but most of
<BR>
the latter ones have all been built with gcc 2.95 or one of the snapshots
<BR>
(the last I uploaded was built with 2.95 with the complex patch to allow
<BR>
glibc to compile on Alpha with proper complex support).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Also, on i386, both Debian and Red Hat's glibc2.1 seem to be providing them,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since the same program does show __register_frame_info@@GLIBC_2.0 and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; company in its 'nm' output (well, it's listed as 'U' on Red Hat, and 'w' on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Debian, but that's not really important since it's a dependency either way).
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, i386 shouldn't have this problem since gcc 2.95 is used on both to
<BR>
build the glibc packages (they never had the complex support problem we
<BR>
did).  I'd have to toss this one back into RH's court, though, since we're
<BR>
really doing things &quot;the right way&quot;.  Problem is, I'd like to maintain
<BR>
compatibility.  Argh, what an ugly problem.  Any suggestions?  I mean, we
<BR>
could, for now, recompile glibc with egcs 1.1.x and then recompile all
<BR>
affected packages (pretty much all), but that's alot to do in such a short
<BR>
amount of time.
<BR>
<P>Is it possible that we just bill this as &quot;the next step&quot; type of release
<BR>
and wait for RH to catch up for a change?
