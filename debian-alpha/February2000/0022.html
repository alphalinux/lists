<P>
I am fairly new to linux and alphas, but have managed so far to install
<BR>
Debian slink and compile a 2.2.14 kernel.
<BR>
<P>Firstly the web browsers that were installed when i first installed slink do
<BR>
not work too well. Arena seems to download web pages but does not show
<BR>
anything on the screen. Gozilla works ok, but disappears (closes) at random
<BR>
times.
<BR>
<P>I would like to install the newly released Netscape but don't know how. I
<BR>
have the .rpm file and have converted it to .deb but i can't seem to get it
<BR>
to work. Is there somewhere i can get step by step instructions to install
<BR>
netscape for debian (alpha)?
<BR>
<P>Is there libraries i need to do this? How do i get and install these
<BR>
libraries?
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
David Hocking.
