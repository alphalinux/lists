<EM>&gt; &gt; Hi,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I've been doing a few things to make installing Debian on Alphas that boot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; from SRM firmware a bit more pleasant, and I'm wondering about how to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; proceed with a few things.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hey, that's great. I checked in our alpha subarch stuff (it's just really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the old stuff a bit cleaned up) in CVS this afternoon. The next TODO items
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for Alpha are:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * fixing the alphaspecific bootfloppies bugs
</EM><BR>
<P>Which ones are these again (aside from usability issues like selecting the
<BR>
correct fdisk and boot method)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; * make harddisk bootable and make rescue floppy 
</EM><BR>
<P>I did these for SRM on Thursday (and actually tested/fixed them on Friday :)
<BR>
Should we try to do something for MILO installs as well?  The problem is
<BR>
that people might be loading MILO in any number of different ways (it could
<BR>
be in firmware, on a DOS partition, or from SRM even) so there doesn't seem
<BR>
to be any general method for making a machine bootable with MILO.  Also
<BR>
there isn't much point in making a MILO bootfloppy (or an SRM one even,
<BR>
actually) I don't think, since the kernel (&quot;rescue&quot;) disk is basically the
<BR>
same thing...
<BR>
<P>That said, we could check for a DOS partition and offer to copy MILO and
<BR>
linload.exe to it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; * boot from CDROM
</EM><BR>
<P>Do we have potato CD scripts (for any architecture) yet?  Who is working on
<BR>
this?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; * update the Alpha documentation
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes - I think I can do this.  This is probably the most important thing, as
<BR>
slink's documentation was nearly useless...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you're tackling the second issue that would be great. Could you discuss
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your ideas with Flynn Marquardt &lt;flynn@isr.uni-stuttgart.de&gt; ? He's done
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a lot of work and testing with our Alpha boot-floppies setup and has got a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; couple of ideas for the boot issues too.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've Cc:'ed him - the code that I've got so far is in
<BR>
utilities/dbootstrap/bootconfig.c, utilities/dbootstrap/partition_config.c,
<BR>
and utilities/dbootstrap/main.c (where the SRM/MILO detection should go -
<BR>
it's not there yet, and just defaults to SRM :)
