<EM>&gt; If you look at the exception handling code in the runtime environment

<EM>&gt; assumed that any data in the DWARF2 frame info is potentially

<EM>&gt; unaligned ... I've been searching in vain for a reference to this

<EM>&gt; possible that it's just broken by design.

<P>Great work!  BTW, the offending code is also in binutils' source and is
<BR>
quite a bit more explicit (see gas/ehopt.c).  I need to look at the DWARF2
<BR>
spec, but I don't see why it would require such a fixed alignment.  FYI,
<BR>
the ehopt.c code is specifically there to optimise gcc's EH frame
<BR>
relocations, so that may be another worthwhile avenue for you to
<BR>
pursue.  Being the binutils maintainer, I really wish I could work on this
<BR>
more right now, but it's a bad time (today's my first day back from my
<BR>
2-week-long vacation/honeymoon).  Let me know if you need me to patch
<BR>
something, though, as I'm equally interested in solving the problem for
<BR>
good.
