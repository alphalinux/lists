<P>[As I've flamed before...]
<BR>
<P>The documentation does not mention much of ANYTHING that's helpful to Alpha
<BR>
users.  Many, many people have asked for help on this list who wouldn't have had
<BR>
to if any of the documentation was remotely Alpha-related.  There's the list of
<BR>
arches and boot floppies, but if you're installing from floppies, it (the HTML
<BR>
version anyway) doesn't even give a link to the eighth base floppy, so you get
<BR>
an incomplete set!!
<BR>
<P>So, WHERE is the current Potato documentation, and HOW can one contribute?  I
<BR>
sent a patch for the slink documentation months ago which seems to have vanished
<BR>
into thin air.
<BR>
<P>It's frustrating to see some of the same questions come up over and over again,
<BR>
to try to do something about it, and to be ignored.  In spite of all the work
<BR>
being put into boot floppies, if there are bad docs, it really gives the
<BR>
impression that Debian doesn't care at all about new Alpha users.
<BR>
<P>With hope for better Potato docs,
<BR>
