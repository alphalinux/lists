<EM>&gt; Aha.  Smoking gun.  I don't know exactly what the issue is/was, but a while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; back (first of the year or so) I spent an evening on IRC with someone figuring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out that the problem was something about the compiler, maybe an optimizer
</EM><BR>
<P>Ahh, I got this from Raul, thought he had talked to you:

<P><EM>&gt; Thanks to Joel, I think I have a solution for this bug (just use
</EM><BR>
&lt;math.h&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; instead of &lt;nan.h&gt;), but I don't know how to test it.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I told him about faure and lully.
<BR>
<P>Incidentally, I run the Alpha autobuilder, so it was built on my
<BR>
system :-)  If this turns out to be the problem, I would suggest
<BR>
applying a patch in your package so that this same problem doesn't
<BR>
recur everytime the package gets rebuilt on alpha.
<BR>
<P>Thanks,

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; problem, I really don't recall, when the package was built for alpha by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; auto-builder.  They built a version that worked, and uploaded it... my guess
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is that my uploading a new version triggered the same but in the auto
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; builders?  Sorry, I don't remember who was helping chase this, it's been a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; while.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Can you try recompiling from the source package on your system and seeing if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the problem persists?  I'll CC debian-alpha on this in case someone else wants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to jump in with some insight.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm on my way out of town (to Toronto) for the weekend, but will be happy to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; help chase this down starting Monday night, if need be.
