<P>
Regarding NTP, and the speedup problem reported in bug 56822.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; this is alpha.
</EM><BR>
<P>Aha.  Smoking gun.  I don't know exactly what the issue is/was, but a while
<BR>
back (first of the year or so) I spent an evening on IRC with someone figuring
<BR>
out that the problem was something about the compiler, maybe an optimizer
<BR>
problem, I really don't recall, when the package was built for alpha by the
<BR>
auto-builder.  They built a version that worked, and uploaded it... my guess
<BR>
is that my uploading a new version triggered the same but in the auto
<BR>
builders?  Sorry, I don't remember who was helping chase this, it's been a
<BR>
while.
<BR>
<P>Can you try recompiling from the source package on your system and seeing if
<BR>
the problem persists?  I'll CC debian-alpha on this in case someone else wants
<BR>
to jump in with some insight.
<BR>
<P>I'm on my way out of town (to Toronto) for the weekend, but will be happy to 
<BR>
help chase this down starting Monday night, if need be.
<BR>
<P>Bdale
