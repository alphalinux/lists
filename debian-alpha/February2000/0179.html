<EM>&gt; &gt;    working hard (Jason did a great job of isolating the problem) on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    this but it may not be possible to fix it before release, and we

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Agreed.  In fact, I doubt we can/will fix it before that time,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unfortunately.  I lack the time to really beat on a solution enough right
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm investigating it now ... unfortunately my dysfunctional internet
<BR>
connection at home and a lack of disk space at work have been
<BR>
conspiring to stop me from working on it all week.  Hopefully the
<BR>
wires will cooperate today and I can poke around in gcc and glibc
<BR>
source for the answer.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 3) Our C library can't even be built with the compiler we are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    shipping.  Enough said.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is not true at all anymore.  The appropriate patch has been included
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in Debian's gcc packages to allow glibc (and many other math packages) to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be compiled now.  I'm going to get the new glibc packages compiled today,
</EM><BR>
<P>Wow!  Excellent.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; fyi.  Also, the reason that we don't autobuild glibc, gcc, and a few other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; packages is because of their importance.  If they should somehow be
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah - by the way, please upload a new glibc *soon*, the current one
<BR>
is really, really, really broken - there is no ldd and no way to get
<BR>
one, and gtk+ refuses to install.  This is basically what prompted me
<BR>
to rant, as I installed potato and basically could not use it for
<BR>
development *at all*.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;    providing exception-handling symbols while theirs doesn't, C++
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    programs compiled on Debian can't run on Red Hat anyway since we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    are using libstdc++2.10.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Great point!  I never thought of this and would break compatibility anyway
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (has anyone on -devel noticed that fact yet?).  I hear that RH6.2 is in
</EM><BR>
<P>I can probably build libstdc++2.9 packages for alpha in a chroot at
<BR>
work - the machine there dual boots Debian and Red Hat too so I can do
<BR>
compatibility testing.  (Again, the tone of my rant was motivated by
<BR>
my distaste at having to boot back into Red Hat to get any work done
<BR>
at all :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; have forseen these events.  Also, I wish I could say that I kept a RH
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system around to check these things (if I did, I would've seen this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already), but I can't.
</EM><BR>
<P>I basically have to dual-boot (or possibly triple-boot with SuSE) at
<BR>
work, so I should be able to do this from now on.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; with.  No, it's not because the version numbers should go up.  It's more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because gcc 2.95 is technically a superiour compiler to egcs 1.1.2 and,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe it or not, provides better support for Alpha than before.  It was
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree without question that it's a superior compiler (especially for
<BR>
C++).  I'm not so sure about its Alpha support.  There are
<BR>
*definitely* some regressions from 1.1.2 to 2.95.x, the most glaring
<BR>
one being the unaligned relocations in libstdc++ (although it's also
<BR>
possible that this is a binutils problem).  Also another thing that
<BR>
prompted me to rant was my inability to compile a 2.3.47 kernel with
<BR>
2.95.2 (internal compiler error).
<BR>
<P>The other thing that bothers me about 2.95.x is that it really does
<BR>
not look like a released version to me.  I'm not one to second-guess
<BR>
Cygnus's motivations for their release cycles, but I get the feeling
<BR>
that 2.95 was released simply in order to have a release named &quot;gcc&quot;.
<BR>
Things like the fact that we are still facing another round of C++ ABI
<BR>
breakage in gcc 3.0 and the flip-flop on -fstrict-aliasing don't sit
<BR>
well with me.  But then again I'm not a toolchain hacker, so this is
<BR>
probably just more paranoid ranting on my part :)
<BR>
<P>I also find it ironic that Red Hat 6.2beta still uses egcs 1.1.2.
<BR>
Essentially, Red Hat has given the released version of their own
<BR>
toolchain a vote of no-confidence.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; unforseeable that RH would base their distribution on egcs 1.1.2, but the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; big argument is, do we, as a distribution, use RH as a standard that we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; must follow or do we have our own development cycle?
</EM><BR>
<P>True.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; of gcc to begin with (among other things).  Right now, there are no easy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; answers anyway and, if needed, I say we just opt to skip the release cycle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for Alpha or at least postpone it.  I know it's never been done before,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but why couldn't it be?
</EM><BR>
<P>It could be done.  I guess we can just keep plugging away at the bugs.
<BR>
Since this is free software, we have the source and we can,
<BR>
theoretically, fix them.
<BR>
<P>Cheers
