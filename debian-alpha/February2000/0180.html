<P><EM>&gt; I'm investigating it now ... unfortunately my dysfunctional internet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connection at home and a lack of disk space at work have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conspiring to stop me from working on it all week.  Hopefully the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wires will cooperate today and I can poke around in gcc and glibc
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; source for the answer.
</EM><BR>
<P>Great!  Good luck and I hope you can get a good solution.  I'd be happy to
<BR>
recompile/upload anything needed....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yeah - by the way, please upload a new glibc *soon*, the current one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is really, really, really broken - there is no ldd and no way to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one, and gtk+ refuses to install.  This is basically what prompted me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to rant, as I installed potato and basically could not use it for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; development *at all*.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's being uploaded today and, with all luck, should be installed today as
<BR>
well.  To ensure things go well, I'm uploading a new deb for 'make' since
<BR>
apparently there was a bug in make exposed by the glibc changeover.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I can probably build libstdc++2.9 packages for alpha in a chroot at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work - the machine there dual boots Debian and Red Hat too so I can do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compatibility testing.  (Again, the tone of my rant was motivated by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my distaste at having to boot back into Red Hat to get any work done
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at all :)
</EM><BR>
<P>It should be easy to build.  I did this awhile ago when libstdc++ versions
<BR>
changed on i386 (I did it more for my own stuff that I just didn't feel
<BR>
like recompiling).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I basically have to dual-boot (or possibly triple-boot with SuSE) at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work, so I should be able to do this from now on.
</EM><BR>
<P>Great, thanks!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I agree without question that it's a superior compiler (especially for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; C++).  I'm not so sure about its Alpha support.  There are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *definitely* some regressions from 1.1.2 to 2.95.x, the most glaring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one being the unaligned relocations in libstdc++ (although it's also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible that this is a binutils problem).  Also another thing that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prompted me to rant was my inability to compile a 2.3.47 kernel with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.95.2 (internal compiler error).
</EM><BR>
<P>Doesn't surprise me.  Believe it or not, I've ran into less ICE problems
<BR>
with gcc 2.95.x than with prior egcs versions.  The newer gcc snapshots
<BR>
appear even better (I try to compile snapshots weekly).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The other thing that bothers me about 2.95.x is that it really does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not look like a released version to me.  I'm not one to second-guess
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Cygnus's motivations for their release cycles, but I get the feeling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that 2.95 was released simply in order to have a release named &quot;gcc&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Things like the fact that we are still facing another round of C++ ABI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; breakage in gcc 3.0 and the flip-flop on -fstrict-aliasing don't sit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well with me.  But then again I'm not a toolchain hacker, so this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably just more paranoid ranting on my part :)
</EM><BR>
<P>I didn't like the -fstrict-aliasing situation either.  Granted, I still
<BR>
agree with the steering committee's initial responce of &quot;fix the code
<BR>
since it's not compliant anyway&quot;, but it would leave alot of people in the
<BR>
dark that rely on the old behaviour.  It also weakened alot of people's
<BR>
trust in the direction of gcc.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I also find it ironic that Red Hat 6.2beta still uses egcs 1.1.2.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Essentially, Red Hat has given the released version of their own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; toolchain a vote of no-confidence.
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe this is because the upstream gcc 2.95.2 still doesn't contain
<BR>
the patch that we've included (for complex support on Alpha), so they are
<BR>
still unable to compile a glibc package with the vanilla gcc 2.95.2.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It could be done.  I guess we can just keep plugging away at the bugs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since this is free software, we have the source and we can,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; theoretically, fix them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, that's the way I see it.  A release's quality is important, but isn't
<BR>
carved in stone, so to speak.  We could always update it if needed.
