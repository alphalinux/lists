Hi
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one of the multias (VM 40) that thelinuxstore gave away
<BR>
several months ago. It came with a scsi card but no external
<BR>
connections to it. I have used the card by opening up an external scsi
<BR>
disk case and connecting the disk to the multia, the disk's power
<BR>
being supplied by the disk case's power supply.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lately I went shopping for the necessary connectors and it turned
<BR>
out that I would have had to shell out about $50 USD to be able to
<BR>
connect my existing scsi card to the external disk. So I decided
<BR>
instead to purchase a card from Starship Computers. I just installed
<BR>
the card and NOTHING seems to work. I turn on the computer and the
<BR>
NumLock CapsLock ScrollLock LED's on the keyboard blink once and
<BR>
that's all that happens. The monitor remains as if the computer was
<BR>
turned off.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Has anyone experienced a similar situation before ??
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there any jumper settings I must change ??
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it's just that I got a faulty card...
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arturo.
