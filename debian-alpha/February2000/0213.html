<EM>&gt;machine check while in PAL mode
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;PC = 18400

<P>I had this problem on my LX164 when I decided to try the SRM console. 
<BR>
Evidently either SRM or the hardware is buggy.  I have had 
<BR>
much, much better luck with AlphaBIOS than with SRM.
<BR>
<P>As to what &quot;Machine check while in PAL mode&quot; means:
<BR>
PAL is Priveleged Architecture Library, and implements various
<BR>
low-level functionality, like fault vectors, interrupts, etc.  PAL is
<BR>
a chip mode that is supposed to run atomically (i.e.
<BR>
non-interruptable).  If an event that triggers PAL mode occurs when
<BR>
already executing in PAL mode, you get this machine check.  My sources
<BR>
tell me (I work at Compaq in the Alpha group) that there's not much
<BR>
left at this point to try to debug what happened.  My machine is a
<BR>
Pyxis Rev B board, and has known bugs (in the chipset) relating to
<BR>
DMA.  I'd be interested to hear the source of your LX; I've been led
<BR>
to believe that revenue-quality boards should not have this problem.
<BR>
<P>When I had this problem, I turned off various kernel options (IDE DMA
<BR>
especially) and that seemed to restrict the problem to soundcard
<BR>
access.  At that point I gave up and went back to AlphaBIOS and MILO,
<BR>
and have been running happily ever since.  Evidently the MILO PALcode
<BR>
is different enough to not trigger the problem.
