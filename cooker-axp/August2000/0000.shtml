<P>
I am currently trying to install the 7.1 for Alpha on a DEC Multia. I
<BR>
have not had much success, and was wondering if anyone else had
<BR>
attempted this installation. I have found that:
<BR>
<P>1)    When using the instructions in the README.milo, instboot.gz does
<BR>
not boot. Either that, or it just take a REALLLLLLYYYYYYYY long time
<BR>
doing so.
<BR>
2)    When substituting /boot/v.gz for /boot/instboot.gz, the install
<BR>
kernel can't find the NCR53c810 SCSI controller, even if I give it the
<BR>
io, irq and base addresses. This could be due to the fact that I may not
<BR>
be entering them correctly. The syntax that I am using is
<BR>
'base=0x4200000 io=0x8000 irq=11', with other permutations, such as
<BR>
'io_port=0x8000, irq=11' and 'io=0x8000 irq=11', figuring that the last
<BR>
would work, as that follows the parameter conventions for loading a
<BR>
module to which my RH6.0 installation adheres.
<BR>
3)    When using my RH6.0 kernel and the Mandrake CDROM.RDZ, I get the
<BR>
installation to start, only to fail because the Multia has an 8-bit
<BR>
plane TGA controller, and, apparently the X for the installs wants more
<BR>
colors, as does the (I would suppose, since I haven't been able to see
<BR>
it completely) cool little graphic that comes up during the boot
<BR>
process.
<BR>
<P>That's the last day of my life, in a nutshell. I was wondering if
<BR>
anybody could point me to some method for starting a text install, or
<BR>
changing the number of colors for the X-server. I'd gladly RTFM, if only
<BR>
I could find an FM to R.
