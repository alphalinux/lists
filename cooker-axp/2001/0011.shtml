<EM>&gt; &gt; 3) I would like to try Alpha cooker, but since the install system doesn't seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to have been upgraded I'm not sure how.  Is it possible for me to upgrade
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; from 7.1 to cooker?  If so, how?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'll let someone else answer that one.
</EM><BR>
It _is_ possible, but it can be hairy. Cooker is running on Glibc 2.2,
<BR>
which is different from 7.1. This will be the main hurdle. For the rest,
<BR>
it runs OK (I use it as a server, I haven't played with X on it for a
<BR>
while). The 2.4 kernel does crash my box now &amp; then, something seems to
<BR>
be wrong with the automounter for some reason. It's on our list to
<BR>
investigate this (fixing the installer is also on our list)...
