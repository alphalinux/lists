</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Over this last weekend I made a determined effort to get the latest Mandrake
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha working on my LX164 and am amazed to report reasonable success.  In the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; absence of an installer (I couldn't find one newer than Jan 2000), I mounted my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; new hard drive under my current system and made creative use of 'rpm --root'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and chroot to do a minimal install.  To my complete amazement, the system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; booted and ran with very few difficulties.  I haven't tried anything advanced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like X or (and here I may be realy pushing my luck) KDE, but I can log in,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; access remote FTP sites via my firewall and compile a new kernel.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>The last time I checked (7mdk of XFree86 4.0.3) it built fine on the Alpha.
<BR>
<P>I can't verify for now since things are automated around here, I guess the
<BR>
build scripts haven't had the time to build a newer XFree86 yet.
<BR>
<P>For KDE, I've also verified that it compiles.
<BR>
<P>I'm quite sure that it works but:
<BR>
If you are not sure just give it a try and report back here, or if you know
<BR>
that it's a program problem, not a packaging problem, then you can report
<BR>
back to the maintainer of the software component.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In the course of doing this I found a few minor problems which folks may wish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to look at:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1)  By default /etc/securettys is blank.  I took me ages to work out why I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; couldn't log in.  I presume that the installer normally sets this based on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; security level chosen, but for those not using the installer, it might be nice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if it contained a default entry of 'tty1'.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I believe that you should login as normal user and then su to root. In
<BR>
terms of security it is a bit safer than allowing direct root tty logins.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2)  The kernel source 2.4.3 RPM has a dependency on ncurses-devel, but cooker
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has no such RPM available (either in Alpha or i586 so far as I can see).  In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the end I used the one from RedHat 7.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I think it should be libcurse5-devel which contains this.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; 3) Building the aic7xxx driver in the latest kernels requires byacc, flex and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; db1-devel (God knows why!).  These need to be added as dependencies to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kernel source RPM.  Ah, minor thought.  I installed the kernel source RPM, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I actually compiled a default kernel from ftp.kernel.org.  Perhaps the Mandrake
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kernel doesn't have these requirements.  I will try to check tonight, but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't see why the aic7xxx driver would be different.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Juan?
<BR>
<P>For flex I am aware of this, since aicasm which BTW we don't include that in the
<BR>
kernel rpm anyway, Chmouel told me is obsolete, needs flex.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Thinking about it, I suspect that none of these problems are AXP specific
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; except for the fact that they are only likely to bite you if you don't have an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installer.  Perhaps I should report them to the main cooker list, or can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone from Mandrake pass them on?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><P><P>Yes, we don't have an installer for the latest cooker yet. ;) In particular,
<BR>
we need to build a newer Alpha BOOT kernel, along with the modules. Otherwise,
<BR>
everything else in the installer should be (fairly?) portable.
