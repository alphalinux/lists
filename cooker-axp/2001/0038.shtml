Mandrakesoft IPO - How to buy shares ?
<BR>
<P>We apologize for any confusion due to the disclaimer on the IPO web site. The 
<BR>
disclaimer was not well written and the English version has been updated to 
<BR>
more accurately reflect the process. A disclaimer is required only because 
<BR>
there are certain countries where an Initial Public Offering by a foreign 
<BR>
country is strictly regulated. There is no law that forbids the buying of 
<BR>
shares, it is just more difficult to do so in an Initial Public Offering.
<BR>
<P>The offering will be closed on Friday at 5PM Paris time. On Monday we will 
<BR>
receive the results of the IPO and send it to you; on the 3rd of August the 
<BR>
shares will be publicly traded. There is no limitation to buy/sell and be 
<BR>
informed about the company after the IPO because it will no longer be an 
<BR>
initial offering.
<BR>
<P>We would like to build a &quot;Howto buy MandrakeSoft shares&quot;. Since the &quot;Marché 
<BR>
Libre&quot; is not very well known it may be difficult to locate brokers for 
<BR>
purchasing shares in this market. If you have any information about buying 
<BR>
shares on the Euronext Marché Libre in your country (and the costs for doing 
<BR>
so) please let the Linux-Mandrake community know on MandrakeForum: 
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.mandrakeforum.com/article.php?sid=1128&lang=en">http://www.mandrakeforum.com/article.php?sid=1128&lang=en</A> We'll collect all 
<BR>
the responses and build a HowTo.
<BR>
