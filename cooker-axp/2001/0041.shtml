SystemLogic.net -- WindowsXP Vs. Linux Mandrake: Some Aesthetic 
Observations.
A writer points out some interesting parallels between Windows XP and 
Mandrake Linux that he discovered while installing WinXP on his PC: 
&quot;The first thing that popped up that made me think about this parallel 
during the set up was the Network Connection Wizard built into the tail 
end of the set up process. Of course, XP being as new as it is, has a 
very large database of native drivers for NICs, so odds are that XP is 
going to find your NIC while it's installing itself on the PC...much 
like Mandrake 8.0 currently does.&quot;

<P>Slashdot also held a discussion on this same topic:

<P><P>Business Case of the Week
----------------------------------------
Devine Entertainment Corp. and Mandrake 8.0.
&quot;We're a small but successful film company here in Toronto (5 Emmy's 
and counting!) with about 10 regular users on 10 workstations (8 
desktop, 2 laptop). I've been using Mandrake since September of 2000, 
and it was my first foray into the world of Linux OS. Prior to this 
I've used Windows 9.x which we regularly use on our workstations here.&quot;

Hidden Treasures: Fun With sed.
Tom continues his series of tips with 'sed' (the Stream EDitor):
&quot;sed is a seasoned veteran among the Unix tools and can be used to do 
some neat things with text.

<P>WebWatch: Security For DSL [and cable] Users.
Tom provides a nice selection of links that explain basic security

<P>AppWatch: Replace.
Tom writes: &quot;'replace' replaces one or more strings with others in one 
or more text or binary files or from standard input . In fact it's the 
only tool I know of which allows you to do text replacements in Linux 
fairly easy (I can't do Perl, so shoot me).&quot;
