<P>
Mandrakesoft is now listed on the stock exchange!
<BR>
<P>MandrakeSoft is pleased to announce that the company is now listed on the 
<BR>
Euronext Marché Libre. As a result of the successful Initial Public Offering, 
<BR>
a total of 688.480 shares were sold at 6.2 Euros each. This results in an 
<BR>
increase in capital of approximately 4.3 million Euros and represents 20.28% 
<BR>
of the company's capital after issue. 
<BR>
<P>It's a big step in MandrakeSoft development and its future.
<BR>
<P>The stock will be publicly traded on Friday, August 3rd. 
<BR>
<P>We would like to thank everyone who helped make the IPO a success. Now 
<BR>
everyone can trade Mandrakesoft shares!
<BR>
<P><P>There are several rules to know before buying or selling shares:
<BR>
<P>What is the Marché Libre ?
<BR>
--------------------------
<BR>
<P>The Marché Libre is a non-regulated European stock market. It is a small 
<BR>
market with less investors &amp; transactions than the larger markets such as 
<BR>
Nasdaq. There is one price determination each day at 3 PM which sets the 
<BR>
market price. The price cannot change more than 10% each day.
<BR>
<P><P>How should I trade Mandrakesoft shares?
<BR>
-----------------------------------
<BR>
<P>MandrakeSoft has been assigned the Euroclear-Paris code &quot;4477&quot;. When trading 
<BR>
on the Marché Libre you should always provide a &quot;limit price&quot; when selling or 
<BR>
buying shares. Because there may not be many transactions, if you don't 
<BR>
provide a price limit you run the risk of buying very high or selling very 
<BR>
low. NEVER conduct a transaction without a limit!
<BR>
<P>A PDF file which describes the market is available from Euronext:

<BR>
<P><P>How can I buy Mandrakesoft shares?
<BR>
----------------------------------
<BR>
<P>Ask your usual broker if they accept orders for Euronext with the Euroclear 
<BR>
Paris code 4477.
<BR>
<P>For more information, please see MandrakeSoft's IPO pages at:

<BR>
