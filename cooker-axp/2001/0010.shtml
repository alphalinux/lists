<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Mandrake isn't going to release any new versions, but several people (on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;this list) are working to keep it gong.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Is there an announcement of this anywhere? Does this mean that its going to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be removed from Mandrake's site?
</EM><BR>
My personal opinion on this is: The main reason why Mandrake won't be
<BR>
releasing a version in the (near) future is because the alpha market is
<BR>
quite small.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Thanks for your prompt reply.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Again, I'm going to defer to the guys still working on it. There are still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people working on cooker, and in fact ALO has donated a machine for this a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well. So the develpoment work is being done, just outside Mandrake Soft.
</EM><BR>
Some people participating in the effort are with Mandrakesoft, some
<BR>
aren't. I beleive most (if not all) of the effort is being done in our
<BR>
&quot;free&quot; time, but most Mandrake hackers are very friendly &amp; polite to put
<BR>
in a modification / patch / bugfix to get things working on the alpha,
<BR>
as long as it doesn't interfere with the other (mainly x86) ports.
<BR>
<P>Here's an un-official peice of html I put up to describe the effort a
<BR>
bit:
