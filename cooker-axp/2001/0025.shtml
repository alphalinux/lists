Gentlemen (and ladies?),
<BR>
<P>Over this last weekend I made a determined effort to get the latest Mandrake
<BR>
Alpha working on my LX164 and am amazed to report reasonable success.  In the
<BR>
absence of an installer (I couldn't find one newer than Jan 2000), I mounted my
<BR>
new hard drive under my current system and made creative use of 'rpm --root'
<BR>
and chroot to do a minimal install.  To my complete amazement, the system
<BR>
booted and ran with very few difficulties.  I haven't tried anything advanced
<BR>
like X or (and here I may be realy pushing my luck) KDE, but I can log in,
<BR>
access remote FTP sites via my firewall and compile a new kernel.
<BR>
<P>In the course of doing this I found a few minor problems which folks may wish
<BR>
to look at:
<BR>
<P>1)  By default /etc/securettys is blank.  I took me ages to work out why I
<BR>
couldn't log in.  I presume that the installer normally sets this based on the
<BR>
security level chosen, but for those not using the installer, it might be nice
<BR>
if it contained a default entry of 'tty1'.
<BR>
<P>2)  The kernel source 2.4.3 RPM has a dependency on ncurses-devel, but cooker
<BR>
has no such RPM available (either in Alpha or i586 so far as I can see).  In
<BR>
the end I used the one from RedHat 7.
<BR>
<P>3) Building the aic7xxx driver in the latest kernels requires byacc, flex and
<BR>
db1-devel (God knows why!).  These need to be added as dependencies to the
<BR>
kernel source RPM.  Ah, minor thought.  I installed the kernel source RPM, but
<BR>
I actually compiled a default kernel from ftp.kernel.org.  Perhaps the Mandrake
<BR>
kernel doesn't have these requirements.  I will try to check tonight, but I
<BR>
can't see why the aic7xxx driver would be different.
<BR>
<P>Thinking about it, I suspect that none of these problems are AXP specific
<BR>
except for the fact that they are only likely to bite you if you don't have an
<BR>
installer.  Perhaps I should report them to the main cooker list, or can
<BR>
someone from Mandrake pass them on?
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
