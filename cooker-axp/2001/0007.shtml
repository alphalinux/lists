<P><EM>&gt; Hello,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've been subscribing to this mailing list for the last 10 days and it seems a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bit quiet.  So I thought that I would ask a few questions:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1) Is there an archive of this list so that I don't have to ask dumb questions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like these again?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup, but there's not much there at the moment :)
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.alphalinux.org/archives/cooker-axp/2001/">http://www.alphalinux.org/archives/cooker-axp/2001/</A>
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 2) Currently I run 7.1 on my Alpha and the new 7.2Freq on my x86 machines.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a policy of trying to run the same distribution on all my systems to ease
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the admin burden, and for that reason I switched to Mandrake from RedHat when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha support became available.  The differences between my Alpha and the x86
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systems grows with each new i586 release.  Are there any plans to bring out a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; new version for the Alpha soon.  If not, then I shall have to move all my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systems back to RedHat or over to SuSE.
</EM><BR>
<P>Mandrake isn't going to release any new versions, but several people (on
<BR>
this list) are working to keep it gong.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3) I would like to try Alpha cooker, but since the install system doesn't seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to have been upgraded I'm not sure how.  Is it possible for me to upgrade
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from 7.1 to cooker?  If so, how?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll let someone else answer that one.
<BR>

<P><EM>&gt; Thanks,
