Hello,
<BR>
<P>I've been subscribing to this mailing list for the last 10 days and it seems a
<BR>
bit quiet.  So I thought that I would ask a few questions:
<BR>
<P>1) Is there an archive of this list so that I don't have to ask dumb questions
<BR>
like these again?
<BR>
<P>2) Currently I run 7.1 on my Alpha and the new 7.2Freq on my x86 machines.  I
<BR>
have a policy of trying to run the same distribution on all my systems to ease
<BR>
the admin burden, and for that reason I switched to Mandrake from RedHat when
<BR>
Alpha support became available.  The differences between my Alpha and the x86
<BR>
systems grows with each new i586 release.  Are there any plans to bring out a
<BR>
new version for the Alpha soon.  If not, then I shall have to move all my
<BR>
systems back to RedHat or over to SuSE.
<BR>
<P>3) I would like to try Alpha cooker, but since the install system doesn't seem
<BR>
to have been upgraded I'm not sure how.  Is it possible for me to upgrade
<BR>
from 7.1 to cooker?  If so, how?
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard Simpson

<P><PRE>
