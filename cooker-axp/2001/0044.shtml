<P><P>Ten Years of Linux
<BR>
----------------------------------------
<BR>
Ten years ago on August 25th 1991, Linus Torvalds announced to the 
<BR>
comp.os.minix newsgroup that he was developing a new computer operating 
<BR>
system. In only one decade, Linux has quickly evolved from one man's 
<BR>
personal project into a worldwide grass-roots movement.
<BR>
<P>The entire staff at MandrakeSoft would like to congratulate and thank 
<BR>
each person who has worked on Free Software projects over the past 
<BR>
decade, and also the millions of users who have discovered the 
<BR>
importance &amp; benefits of Free Software. Happy Birthday Linux, we wish 
<BR>
you many more!
<BR>

<P><P>Awards &amp; Accolades
<BR>
----------------------------------------
<BR>
The September issue of Linux Magazine features the &quot;2001 Editor's
<BR>
Choice Awards: The Tuxies&quot; -- Mandrake Linux 8.0 is awarded first place 
<BR>
for best Desktop Distribution, and the Mandrake Linux Corporate Server 
<BR>
is selected as runner-up in the Server category. This is some of 
<BR>
what they say about 8.0:
<BR>
&quot;While all Linux distributions share a lot of features, it's the little 
<BR>
touches that make all the difference. We chose Linux-Mandrake for &quot;Best 
<BR>
Desktop Distro&quot; for many reasons, and mostly because it makes setup and 
<BR>
configuration a snap. The Mandrake Control Center makes it dead easy to
<BR>
configure network settings, printers, and security...
<BR>
In short, it would be hard to ask for more from a desktop system than 
<BR>
what you get with Mandrake 8.0.&quot;

<P><P>Mandrake in the News
<BR>
----------------------------------------
<BR>
Canada Computes.com reviews the Mandrake Linux 8.0 Powerpack Edition
<BR>
and concludes:
<BR>
&quot;Mandrake 8.0 is as close to a flawless Linux distribution as you can 
<BR>
get, and I would highly recommend to anyone. Mandrake 8.0, as far as 
<BR>
I'm concerned, is now the benchmark against which other distributions 
<BR>
will be measured.
<BR>
It really is that good.&quot;

<BR>
<P>ZDNet -- The Linux lineup.
<BR>
ZDNet evaluates seven major Linux distributions and has this to say
<BR>
about Mandrake 8.0:
<BR>
&quot;Simply put, no other distribution beats the polished user experience 
<BR>
offered by Linux-Mandrake 8.0. If you're currently running release 7.2, 
<BR>
version 8.0 provides a seamless upgrade. And if you've never tried 
<BR>
Linux-Mandrake, version 8.0's amazing level of automation and its 
<BR>
decked-out installation GUI provide the perfect Linux launching point. 
<BR>
Featuring a GUI face-lift and the latest versions of the kernel, 
<BR>
XFree86, GNOME and KDE, Linux-Mandrake 8.0 sits squarely at the 
<BR>
forefront of powerful yet easy-to-use distributions.&quot;

<P>The September edition of Linux Magazine has a short piece titled: 
<BR>
Linux-Mandrake Single Network Firewall: Security in Style --
<BR>
&quot;Everyone knows that Linux is a great OS for building a firewall. 
<BR>
Unfortunately, setting up a firewall can be tricky for a non-guru when 
<BR>
you have to muck about with setting up firewall rules at the command 
<BR>
line.
<BR>
Linux-Mandrake's Single Network Firewall takes some of the pain out of 
<BR>
firewall setup and allows configuration to be done through a secure Web 
<BR>
interface. In addition to firewall features, the Single Network 
<BR>
Firewall provides Proxy services, DHCP, content filtering, and 
<BR>
sophisticated network monitoring tools.
<BR>
The Single Network Firewall distro is available for download, or you 
<BR>
can purchase it through Mandrake or one of their resellers at the 
<BR>
street price of $99.&quot;
<BR>
<P><P>Business Case of the Week
<BR>
----------------------------------------
<BR>
Linux Mandrake is a better Domain server than NT!!!
<BR>
The University of Southampton uses Mandrake Linux 7.2 with Samba 2.0.7 
<BR>
as a domain logon server for their &quot;Surface Science and Catalysis&quot; 
<BR>
research group:
<BR>
&quot;We have about 25 NT4 WS machines with about 35 users and a handful of 
<BR>
95/3.11 boxes too... We use the linux machine not only for a Domain 
<BR>
server but also as a filestore, print server, ftp server, mail 
<BR>
server/router and a compute server.&quot;

<BR>
Trying To Recover MF (I): The Ifs, the Hows and the Whens.
<BR>
Tom and Vincent discuss the recovery process for the MandrakeForum 
<BR>
website, and spark some interesting comments about RAID.

<BR>
<P>Common Misconceptions About The GPL.
<BR>
Tom kicks-off a lively discussion about the General Public License: 
<BR>
&quot;Every eight weeks or so there's a somewhat heated discussion on GPL   
<BR>
related issues. One reason why these discussions are so impassionate is 
<BR>
that a lot of people misunderstand the nature or the content of this 
<BR>
license. Here are some of the most popular misconceptions...&quot;

A dead hard drive temporarily disabled the Forum on Tuesday.

Unfortunately many of the stories posted over the past four weeks are

now missing; data recovery is being performed on the drive so hopefully

all of the past stories will be back online soon.
