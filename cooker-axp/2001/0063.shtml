<P><P>Gamer's Edition of Mandrake Linux -- An Ideal Christmas Gift!
<BR>
-----------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
Christmas is coming... have you already written your letter to Santa? If not, 
<BR>
it's time to take a look at the brand new &quot;Gaming Edition&quot; of Mandrake Linux 
<BR>
8.1, which comes bundled with Transgaming's &quot;WineX&quot; (enhanced version of 
<BR>
Wine, optimized for DirectX support) and the legendary &quot;Sims&quot;!
<BR>
<P>The &quot;Gaming Edition&quot; is now available for pre-order at MandrakeStore,
<BR>
and will be available in selected stores in USA, Canada, GB, and
<BR>
Australia too. In the meantime, you can read an exclusive review of the 
<BR>
product at MandrakeForum written by our usual labor mouse (Deno) with a 
<BR>
little help from his family:

<BR>
<P><P>Mandrake OEM program details.
<BR>
----------------------------------------
<BR>
MandrakeSoft's OEM program has been newly positioned and is now much 
<BR>
friendlier towards 'small' OEM partners than ever before. Even more 
<BR>
importantly, the process of becoming a MandrakeSoft OEM partner has been 
<BR>
greatly simplified, and a web page has been set up to explain &quot;everything you 
<BR>
need to know in order to become a Mandrakesoft OEM partner&quot;:
<BR>
<P>1) OEM program description on Mandrakesoft.com:

<P><P>Financial Corner.
<BR>
----------------------------------------
<BR>
A history of the company's stock price is now available online at:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.mandrakesoft.com/company/investors/trade">http://www.mandrakesoft.com/company/investors/trade</A>
<BR>
<P>After a decline in the stock price during September and October, MandrakeSoft 
<BR>
stock has come back strong with a significant increase since the begining of 
<BR>
the month. Regarding the market valuation, it's interesting to note that it 
<BR>
is currently valued at less than 2% of Red Hat and under 0.00005% of 
<BR>
Microsoft.
<BR>
<P>For those who want to trade MandrakeSoft stock outside of Europe, the best 
<BR>
online broker seems to be Keytrade.com. If you find a better solution please 
<BR>

<P><P>Mandrake in the News
<BR>
----------------------------------------
<BR>
The &quot;Distribution Watch&quot; website has been very active lately with the 
<BR>
introduction of their &quot;The Linux Distribution Game&quot;. In addition to
<BR>
introductory text which invites you to try living without Microsoft Windows 
<BR>
for one month, the article contains descriptions of the main Linux 
<BR>
distributions, and several lesser known ones.
<BR>
<P>Although fairly simplistic, the comparisons offered on &quot;Distribution
<BR>
Watch&quot; is much more accurate than any other distribution comparison we
<BR>
have seen this year. If nothing else, at least the author realizes that &quot;one 
<BR>
size doesn't fit all', and the fact that Slackware Linux doesn't exist as a 
<BR>
commercial entity anymore doesn't mean that this distribution is dead. 
<BR>
Insisting on the fact that Mandrake Linux provides very stable servers, while 
<BR>
being very much on a 'bleeding edge' as far as GUI programs are concerned 
<BR>
would be nitpicking...
<BR>
<A HREF="http://distrowatch.com/game.htm">http://distrowatch.com/game.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>Just a few days later, DistroWatch introduced a novel way of measuring
<BR>
distribution popularity: they are analyzing their Web-logs, and
<BR>
estimating the popularity of a distribution based on number of visitors using 
<BR>
a distribution. Of course, there are limits to the accuracy of this method, 
<BR>
but the same can be said about any other way of estimating numbers of Linux 
<BR>
users. Distribution rankings based on the results of this measurement are 
<BR>
available in a table on the main DistroWatch
<BR>
page. At the moment I am writing this article, Mandrake Linux ranks
<BR>
second.
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.distrowatch.com">http://www.distrowatch.com</A>
<BR>
<P>While we are at &quot;estimating number of Linux users&quot; theme, it is worth
<BR>
noting that LinuxCounter has recently cleaned up old accounts, and at the 
<BR>
same time received a lot of additional publicity. For a long time considered 
<BR>
&quot;obsolete&quot; by the same folks who considered GNU organization obsolete, 
<BR>
LinuxCounter still stands as the only place on the web which offers free 
<BR>
statistics about the growth of Linux usage. At this moment, 17% of registered 
<BR>
machines in LinuxUser database are running Mandrake
<BR>
Linux (up from 10% 6 months ago), which puts Mandrake Linux in third
<BR>
place behind Red Hat and Debian.
<BR>
<A HREF="http://linuxcounter.org">http://linuxcounter.org</A>
<BR>
<P>Even better are results of online polls. We haven't seen a single online
<BR>
poll which doesn't show Mandrake in front of all other distributions in
<BR>
last few months. Here are some examples:
<BR>
<P>- PC Magazine: Windows killer...

<P><P>What's Cooking at Mandrakesoft?
<BR>
----------------------------------------
<BR>
Exclusively for newsletter readers: Our printing specialist has found
<BR>
out a way to seamlessly integrate commercial applications such as Star
<BR>
Office with our printing system. Expect to see changes in printing subsystem 
<BR>
being submitted to Cooker these days, and full explanation of the changes on 
<BR>
MandrakeForum once we are sure everything works perfectly.
<BR>
<P><P>Business Case of the Week;
<BR>
----------------------------------------
<BR>
Picking a 'Business Case of the Week' has been difficult this time.
<BR>
Our choice went to &quot;Bartram Enterprises&quot;, a company which specializes in
<BR>
&quot;network security&quot;.
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.mandrakebizcases.com/article.php?sid=165&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0">http://www.mandrakebizcases.com/article.php?sid=165&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0</A>
<BR>
<P>Bartram Enterprises uses MandrakeSoft products in a variety of ways,
<BR>
including the use of Single Network Firewall as a base of a
<BR>
&quot;stand-alone, pre-configured solution for small business&quot;, and provides 
<BR>
security services to Complete Computer Solutions - ISP 
<BR>
(<A HREF="http://www.ccsisp.com/">http://www.ccsisp.com/</A>), and their customers. From CCS-ISP
<BR>
home-page:
<BR>
<P>Bartram Enterprises will be handling a significant portion of the
<BR>
design, implementation, security and support functions of the core CCS-ISP 
<BR>
network. Bartram Enterprises is the only registered VAR, consultant and 
<BR>
integrator of Linux-Mandrake in the greater Buffalo region of New York State.
<BR>
<P>Every &quot;bizcase&quot; counts: please share your story with others by
<BR>

<BR>
Migrating from Linux to Windows (Yeah sure)
<BR>
<P>Microsoft Germany recently started a new round of anti-Linux campaign,
<BR>
and offers attractive prizes for best testimonies of the &quot;Migrating from
<BR>
Linux...&quot; type. Guess this gives a new importance to testimonies of the 
<BR>
opposite type on MandrakeBizcases.com

<BR>
<P><P>Viewing DVD movies under Mandrake Linux 8.1
<BR>
<P>'Canek' explains how to view DVDs under Mandrake Linux. This inevitably
<BR>
caused discussion about &quot;best DVD viewer under Linux&quot;...

<BR>
<P><P>Day after at Linux counter
<BR>
<P>A month ago, LinuxCounter announced that it will drop all accounts which
<BR>
have not been accessed for two years or more. On one hand, this resulted
<BR>
in loss of many users who registered years ago; but on the other hand, it 
<BR>
gave LinuxCounter more visibility, resulting in a large number of new 
<BR>
registrations.
<BR>
See a summary of &quot;Great cleaning&quot; results on MandrakeForum.

<P><P>Netscape 6.2 - A Review
<BR>
<P>Tom tested the latest (6.2) version of Netscape for you. Apparently,
<BR>
Netscape developers have finally managed to put together a really good
<BR>
product. Time to finally bury and forget the aging Netscape 4.x browsers?
