<EM>&gt; I subscribed yesterday to this list, to see if I could install Cooker
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on my old Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<P>Welcome.  You will find that it is very quiet and peaceful here :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; My alpha axp has only 16 Mb ram.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is that enough to try Cooker on, or should I better go with Mdk 7.1
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think that it makes any difference.  16 MB isn't very much at all, 
<BR>
but you might squeeze something in if you don't want to run X.  What sort of 
<BR>
machine exactly do you have?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; then, and upgrade to Cooker once it's running.
</EM><BR>
<P>The thing you need to grasp is that since 7.1 there hasn't been a working 
<BR>
install suit for Mandrake Alpha.  You should be able to install 7.1 OK, but 
<BR>
upgrading to Cooker involves replacing packages by hand and it is mighty 
<BR>
difficult to do this without breaking your working 7.1.
<BR>
<P>What I did was to install a minimal 7.1 on one hard disc and then spend many 
<BR>
happy hours downloading Cooker and installing it onto another drive with 
<BR>
creative use of the chroot command.  It did work, but by God it was a 
<BR>
character building experience!!!
<BR>
<P>If the installer is now working and I am talking drivel please stop me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm planning on an nfs install here.
</EM><BR>
<P>Good Luck!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; According to this message I could best wait for the mirrors to update
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with this kernel:
</EM><BR>
<P>I think that what Stefan and Jeff have done here is to get a kernel with all 
<BR>
the Mandrake patches working OK.  This is something I don't bother with since 
<BR>
I like to stay on the bleading edge and applying Linus's latest 2.4.Xprex 
<BR>
patch against a heavily patched distribution kernel just causes unnecessary 
<BR>
pain so I just stick with the pure untainted Linus kernel (with an LVM patch) 
<BR>
which seems to work just fine.  I guess that I don't get things like XFS, but 
<BR>
I manage to live quite happily without.
<BR>
<P>Have fun.
