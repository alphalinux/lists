<P><PRE>
--
<P>The August 13th edition of the Mandrake Cooker Weekly News speaks about 
the Drakxtools being &quot;web-enabled&quot; -- this means that in Mandrake 8.1, 
all the cool tools in the Mandrake Control Center will be accessible 
through a secure web browser.
<P>Another interesting feature planned for 8.1 is a set of scripts for 
hot-plug hardware so that you'll be able to plug in a USB 
camera/webcam/whatever and see the appropriate shortcut appear 
&quot;automagically&quot; on the desktop.
<P>To subscribe to the Mandrake Cooker Weekly News, send an email to: 
sympa@linux-mandrake.com with the words &quot;subscribe cooker-mcwn&quot; (no 
quotes) in the subject line. To read the online Web version, please see

we'd like to meet you.
<P><P>Spotlight on KDE
----------------------------------------
One of the many wonderful Free Software projects that MandrakeSoft 
proudly sponsors is KDE. KDE is an independent software project that 
has hundreds of developers working through the Internet to create a 
sophisticated, customizable and stable desktop environment.
<P>Just last week the KDE project announced the final release of KDE 2.2 
which features many new additions, speed/performance enhancements, and 
stability improvements. For more information about what's new in KDE 
2.2, check out their &quot;Features&quot; page at:

<P><P>Business Case of the Week
----------------------------------------
Mandrake-Linux Migration for local government is well under way!
An IT manager of a municipality located near Montreal, Quebec, Canada, 
has migrated nearly his entire network to Mandrake Linux:
&quot;With the exception of four client PC's used for Graphics and specialty 
software, our migration is almost complete. We have reduced our O/S and 
software costs by 92%, and increased reliability by 400%!
Next-Stop - City Hall!&quot;

<P><P>Top Stories of the Week from MandrakeForum
----------------------------------------
Playing Movies with Mandrake.
marhol asks the question: &quot;What programs are people using to view movie 
files with Mandrake? Mpeg's arent a worry but what about avi's ? The 
programme I have heard a lot about (XMPS) wouldn't compile and does 
anyone know if Apple will release a QuickTime player for Linux?&quot;

<P>GNOME 1.4.1 Beta1 RPMs On Cooker.
Lots of new features for people who like to stay on the &quot;bleeding 
edge&quot;; Nautilus 1.0.4 is reportedly much faster than the previous 
version.

<P>For The Adventurous: Obscure Kernel Patches.
Tom writes: &quot;As you may know, everyone can write patches to the 
standard Linux kernel as released by kernel.org. Sometimes these 
patches get integrated, but more often they are either too specialized 
or potentially dangerous to be included.&quot;

<P>WebWatch: Font Resources.
Tom offers some tips on locating free fonts on the Internet that can be 
used with Mandrake Linux.
