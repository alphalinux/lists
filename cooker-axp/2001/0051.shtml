<BR>
<P>Mandrake Linux 8.1 boxes soon in a store near you
<BR>
-------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>This week Mandrake Linux boxes started shipping to wholesalers.
<BR>
Simultaneously, MandrakeStore started shipping pre-ordered boxes.
<BR>
One way or another, in a few days you should have one of
<BR>
Mandrake Linux 8.1 boxes in your hands.
<BR>
Just a quick reminder, Mandrake Linux 8.1 comes is available in 3
<BR>
editions:
<BR>
<P>- Standard Edition (Basic product, mainly for Desktop users)
<BR>
- PowerPack (Additional applications and development tools)
<BR>
- ProSuite  (Special server-oriented package)
<BR>
<P>A full description of different Mandrake Linux packages is available on
<BR>
MandrakeSoft products pages:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.mandrakesoft.com/products/range">http://www.mandrakesoft.com/products/range</A>
<BR>
<P>In addition to the above mentioned packages, MandrakeStore
<BR>
(<A HREF="http://www.MandrakeStore.com">http://www.MandrakeStore.com</A>) also sells cheap 3-CD &quot;Download Edition&quot;
<BR>
version, as well as a DVD version.
<BR>
<P>These two offers are intended for users who are familiar with Linux as
<BR>
they include neither support nor manuals.
<BR>
<P><P>The Release Candidate of Mandrake Linux 8.1 for Itanium
<BR>
-------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>Constantly in the shadow of the &quot;mainstream&quot; Mandrake Linux version
<BR>
for Pentium and compatible processors, development of Mandrake Linux
<BR>
for Itanium has received very little attention so far. Obviously,
<BR>
first-generation i64 architecture from Intel still offers too little
<BR>
for too high a price, but sooner or later Itanium will end up in your
<BR>
server room, and eventually power your desktop too.
<BR>
It's good to know that Itanium-optimized Mandrake Linux will be there
<BR>
when you need it!
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Mandrake in the News
<BR>
----------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>This week, a rumor about &quot;Mandrake Linux 8.1 Gamers Edition&quot; leaked
<BR>
out on &quot;BluesNews&quot;
<BR>
(<A HREF="http://www.bluesnews.com/cgi-bin/board.pl?action=viewthread&threadid=29767">http://www.bluesnews.com/cgi-bin/board.pl?action=viewthread&threadid=29767</A>)
<BR>
first, and Slashdot
<BR>
(<A HREF="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/10/20/1755210">http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/10/20/1755210</A>) quickly picked up
<BR>
the story.
<BR>
<P>Judging from comments on Slashdot, plenty of people out there have been
<BR>
eagerly waiting for a gaming-oriented Linux distribution for a very long
<BR>
time, and we are happy to confirm the story:
<BR>
there will be a &quot;Gamers Edition&quot; of Mandrake Linux 8.1 in a near future,
<BR>
and it will contain &quot;The Sims&quot;.
<BR>
(<A HREF="http://www.MandrakeSoft.com/company/press/pr?n=/pr/products/1318">http://www.MandrakeSoft.com/company/press/pr?n=/pr/products/1318</A>)
<BR>
<P><P>What's cooking at MandrakeSoft?
<BR>
----------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>If You have problems with installing or running Mandrake Linux 8.1, take
<BR>
a look at Mandrake Linux 8.1 errata page
<BR>
(<A HREF="http://www.Linux-mandrake.com/en/81errata.php3">http://www.Linux-mandrake.com/en/81errata.php3</A>), and related
<BR>
discussions on Mandrake Forum (search for &quot;errata&quot;). These pages list
<BR>
solutions to most important problems encountered so far, and reading
<BR>
them can save you a lot of time.
<BR>
<P>Btw, 8.1 erratas are slowing down, i.e. we have reached the phase where
<BR>
most of the problems with distribution are known, and workarounds or
<BR>
bug-fixes have already been published.
<BR>
<P>Our developers are asking your help:
<BR>
<P>No laboratory is big enough to do complete tests on some types of
<BR>
software (kernel, Internet connection tools, hardware detection...)
<BR>
Therefore, Mandrake developers occasionally make &quot;calls for help&quot; on
<BR>
cooker mailing list and on MandrakeForum.
<BR>
This week there have been two calls for help on MandrakeForum:
<BR>
<P>First call concerns those of you who connect to Internet with (A)DSL,
<BR>
especially TDSL in Germany. Support for (A)DSL in
<BR>
Mandrake Linux distribution is almost legendary good, but some users
<BR>
have nevertheless reported problems with this type of connection.
<BR>
An updated version of the script has been provided, and you are kindly
<BR>
asked to test it and report what happened.
<BR>
<P>Second call is for testing a future kernel update which solves several
<BR>
security problems, and fixes Supermount.
<BR>
(see: <A HREF="http://www.MandrakeForum.org/article.php?sid=1327&lang=en">http://www.MandrakeForum.org/article.php?sid=1327&lang=en</A>) Unless
<BR>
some grave problems are found, this kernel
<BR>
may already be in 8.1 updates directory on ftp servers, if not you are
<BR>
kindly asked to join the testers.
<BR>
<P>Business Case of the Week;
<BR>
----------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>The Southern Illinois Power Cooperative is a 272 MW power
<BR>
generating station. Recently, they have updated their internal
<BR>
IT infrastructure - including 24x7 data monitoring and
<BR>
network core  services - to a robust information system
<BR>
based on Mandrake Linux. The story is on Platts.com, and it's
<BR>
worth a read.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Online update trough HTTP proxies
<BR>
Software Manager (rpmdrake) is coming of age. One of the missing
<BR>
features which have been added to a newest rpmdrake version is
<BR>
&quot;updating trough HTTP proxies&quot;. Read what other users have to say
<BR>
about the latest rpmdrake here:

<BR>
<P>Urpm in Mandrake Linux 8.1
<BR>
As you know, rpmdrake is just a graphical interface to urpm tools.
<BR>
In Mandrake Linux 8.1, these tools have been updated. In particular,
<BR>
search facilities have been greatly improved since Mandrake Linux 8.0
<BR>
distribution.
