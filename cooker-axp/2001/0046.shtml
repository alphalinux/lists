After receiving feedback from MandrakeSoft investors, many
<BR>
people recommend &quot;VMS-Keytrade&quot;. VMS-Keytrade (<A HREF="http://www.keytrade.com">http://www.keytrade.com</A>) 
<BR>
is Belgium's largest online broker; they make it easy to trade 
<BR>
MandrakeSoft stock from most locations worldwide. Just visit their web 
<BR>
site, open an account by printing &amp; completing a form, then start 
<BR>
trading - it's that easy.
<BR>
<P>If you've purchased MandrakeSoft stock from a broker that you'd like to
<BR>
recommend, please send the details to Jennifer Miller at
<BR>
jmiller@mandrakesoft.com so we can pass on the tip to other potential
<BR>
MandrakeSoft investors.
<BR>
<P>Be a partner with MandrakeSoft by becoming a shareholder. It's
<BR>
important that MandrakeSoft stock remains in the hands of people who
<BR>
share our focus, priorities, and who understand the value of Free
<BR>
Software. Remember: a company that is 60% owned by Mandrake users can 
<BR>
be quite different than if 60% owned by financial investors.

<P><P>Cooker Weekly News Summary
<BR>
----------------------------------------
<BR>
The September 3rd edition of the Mandrake Cooker Weekly News discusses
<BR>
the current status of Cooker:
<BR>
<P>&quot;In order to stabilize the current cooker to create the new Mandrake
<BR>
Linux 8.1, new versions and features are banned from cooker. This is to
<BR>
test and debug as much as possible, before the fork between a new
<BR>
Cooker, which will be the development version for the next Mandrake
<BR>
Linux version, and stable 8.1, that is likely to be finished by the end
<BR>
of September.&quot;
<BR>
&quot;Additionally, more than 800 updates/releases of packages were included
<BR>
between August, 24th and September, 3rd in Cooker!&quot;
<BR>
<P>Read the current online version at <A HREF="http://mt.mandrake.org/mcwn/">http://mt.mandrake.org/mcwn/</A>
<BR>
or subscribe by sending an email to sympa@linux-mandrake.com with the

Mandrake 8.1 Beta 3 &quot;Raklet&quot; now available for download &amp; testing.
<BR>
Beta 3 of the upcoming Mandrake Linux 8.1 &quot;Raklet&quot; has hit the mirrors.
<BR>
This is most likely the final beta before the &quot;Release Candidate&quot;, so
<BR>
now is your chance to get an early look at the upcoming Mandrake Linux
<BR>
8.1 and report any bugs and/or problems. With your help, Mandrake 8.1
<BR>
can be the best release ever.
<BR>
<P>Please see <A HREF="http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/81beta3.php3">http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/81beta3.php3</A> for a list of
<BR>
changes &amp; improvements since the previous beta, and learn about the
<BR>
many new features.
<BR>
<P>To participate as a beta tester, please download the files from
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/ftp.php3#81beta;">http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/ftp.php3#81beta;</A> then install &amp; test on
<BR>
your machine and report any bugs to:
<BR>
https://qa.mandrakesoft.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi
<BR>
<P>Also, please subscribe to the Cooker mailing list by sending an email
<BR>
to sympa@linux-mandrake.com with the words &quot;SUB cooker&quot; (no quotes) in
<BR>
the subject of your message to report and discuss any problems.
<BR>
<P><P>What's a &quot;Raklet&quot;?
<BR>
----------------------------------------
<BR>
Several people have inquired about the name of the Mandrake 8.1 Beta --
<BR>
&quot;Raklet&quot; (or raclette).
<BR>
Raclette is melted cheese that is poured over various food items, such
<BR>
as potatoes and meat, to create a meal. Beta testers of Mandrake 8.1
<BR>
can view the MandrakeSoft developers enjoying this popular French
<BR>
dish during software package installation. Visit a special section of
<BR>
the MandrakeSoft website to take a look at the developers breaking-in a
<BR>
new Raclette grill.

<P><P>Business Case of the Week
<BR>
----------------------------------------
<BR>
Software development house switches from SourceSafe to Mandrake/CVS.
<BR>
&quot;We had an initial trial period where we installed Mandrake on an old
<BR>
PII 233. We immediately recognized the huge benefits of using CVS
<BR>
(multiple developers working on the same file at the same time, very
<BR>
advanced tagging/branching/merging, point in time recovery,
<BR>
comprehensive logs, diffs over time by developer etc...) and installed
<BR>
a production instance of Mandrake on a Proliant 1600....
<BR>
Today we are migrating all of our source control for all of our
<BR>
projects over to Mandrake/CVS.&quot;

<P><P>Top Stories of the Week from MandrakeForum

----------------------------------------
<BR>
How to move a web site to a new server?
<BR>
Denis is back from vacation and he's got plans to move the
<BR>
MandrakeForum website to another server. He asks:
<BR>
&quot;How can I move a server from one place to another with minimal
<BR>
downtime?&quot; and receives some very good suggestions.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>What will be [left] out of 8.1 compared to 8.1b2?
<BR>
andresrc asks: &quot;I've been testing 8.1b2 this weekend and [it] looks
<BR>
really fine: my problem is that there are some things missing
<BR>
(kernel-sources, for example, so I can't compile nvidia kernel module
<BR>
:) ) and the two CDs are completely full. - What will be [left] out of
<BR>
the final compared to this beta?&quot;
<BR>
The answer is quite simple: 8.1final will consist of three CDs.
<BR>
To reduce download time, it's been decided to 'shrink' the Beta to two
<BR>
CDs. You can download the rest, like the kernel-sources package, from a
<BR>
Cooker mirror of your choice. 8.1 will contain about 1500 packages.

Mandrake 8.1 will offer the &quot;ext3&quot; journalized file system in addition

to ReiserFS, so this next story is very timely:

simple. Still have a problem with '/', but actively looking for a
