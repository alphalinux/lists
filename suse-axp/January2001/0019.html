Hi!
<BR>
<P>I cc'ed the xfree list, since this mail contains some suggestions
<BR>
for them, too.
<BR>
<P>Please cc me, because i am not subscribed to xpert@XFree86.Org,
<BR>
thanks!
<BR>
<P>Some time ago i reported in the suse-axp list, 
<BR>
that my newly installed SuSE 7.0 system (Linux alpha, ruffian) stopped
<BR>
working with X. (In 6.1 and 6.3 my card worked without any problems).
<BR>
I made a SuSE support call, but they gave up.
<BR>
I even bought a new SiS 6326 card and replaced the ATI Xpert.
<BR>
This setup didn't work either and produced nearly identical error messages
<BR>
(None of the configured devices were found - but there is a line
<BR>
in the error output of X, that shows, that the card was detected).
<BR>
All this was with XFree 3.3.6.
<BR>
<P>Now i tried a different approach:
<BR>
I downloaded XFree 4.0.2, but the binary version contains the sis driver
<BR>
only for intel architecture, but not for Alphas (the same holds for ati).
<BR>
So i gave the german telecom a few bucks and downloaded the sources, added
<BR>
the sis driver to XF86CardDrivers in the file 
<BR>
xc/config/cf/xfree86.cf (otherwise sis will not be built) and did a make World
<BR>
(after that i gave the coffee industries a lot of bucks).
<BR>
<P>After struggling with some installation problems (make installs bombs, if
<BR>
the app-defaults isn't a directory but a symbolic link like it is in  SuSE),
<BR>
i got a nearly usable X.
<BR>
I would suggest to replace 'if [ -d foo ]' with 'if [ -d foo -a -L foo ]'
<BR>
or something more senceful in the Makefile (install section) in programs/bitmaps iirc)
<BR>
<P>The remaining problems:
<BR>
- i can only use 8 bit color depth otherwise i somehow don't get any fonts.
<BR>
- i cannot use hardware acceleration, because if i do so, X comes up and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lookes really nice, but if i move a window, it looses its complete interior's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;content (i.e. its interior becomes completely white - which differs 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;from my bg color).
<BR>
<P>This X setup is usable but incredible slow.
<BR>
<P>My questions:
<BR>
- Has the sis driver on x86 the same problems?
<BR>
- If it has, why isn't it built on Alpha systems, too?
<BR>
- Could the xfree experts at SuSE provide a XFree 4.0.2 rpm update?
<BR>
<P>Thanks for any help an advance,
<BR>
Martin.
