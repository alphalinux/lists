<P>
Hi AXP-Linuxers, 
<BR>
<P>as a follow-up to yesterday's questions (thanks to all those 
<BR>
who answered), I would like to tell some first impressions. 
<BR>
(All this was done on an &quot;Alpha Station 200 4/166&quot; with 96 MB RAM, 
<BR>
running SuSE 6.1 / kernel 2.2.9, with a TGA graphics card.)  
<BR>
<P>1) As a first step, I built a &quot;milo&quot; (2.2) floppy. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the book (page 19), I also made a boot selection entry 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in my ARC BIOS. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the floppy would come up correctly. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, its messages would be displayed with some accents above 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;characters which never take them (&quot;r&quot; and &quot;k&quot;, among others), 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and no letter would extend below the base line (&quot;g&quot; and &quot;j&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lost their lower parts ...). 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then noticed the table on page 18 and corrected my boot entry 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from kernel &quot;vm_full.gz&quot; to &quot;vm_tga.gz&quot;, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the kernel texts were displayed correctli, but milo's were still 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;funny (but readable). 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose to add/repeat a note about the different kernel images 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where the ARC entries are described, or to use a different font 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the file name to show this may need modification. 
<BR>
<P>2) Following the &quot;Updating ...&quot; description in section 13.1.2 (page
<BR>
334), 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeatedly tried to boot CD 2. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would always fail with MILO 2.2, so I made and tried a 2.0.35 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;floppy (page 20) and played around with the &quot;OsLoadOptions&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parameter - which also failed. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took me several such tries till I realized that the note to use 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CD 2 is plain wrong for AXP systems - like a new installation, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;updates are also done from CD 1 on these systems. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(It seems there is no &quot;Yast2&quot; for AXP systems, is that the reason 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the different CD usage ? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that I miss it, &quot;Yast1&quot; is fine with me.) 
<BR>
<P>3) I then booted via Floppy (MILO 2.2) and CD 1 into Yast1. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I may later try to make a working boot selection for CD, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now that I know CD 1 must be used and not 2.) 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started a &quot;system update&quot;. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It did some packages, the last line being &quot;nkitb&quot;. This was followed
<BR>
by 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Removing package libauth-0.1-7&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then a shocking message in yellow letters on red background: 
<BR>
<P>/bin/sh: error in loading shared libraries: /lib/libncurses.so.5: symbol 
<BR>
__register_frame_info, version GLIBC_2.0 not defined in file libc.so.6.1
<BR>
with link time reference
<BR>
execution of script failed 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I have not yet really used the system after the update, except for 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some minor cleanup, so I can not tell whether that message has any 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bad consequences or can safely be ignored.)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upgrade proceeded with package &quot;pam&quot;. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All other messages were warnings about backup copies and
<BR>
configuration 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;file changes, the final lines read 
<BR>
<P>Base system: SuSE-Linux-US-Version-Alpha 7.0.0-0 
<BR>
INSTALLATION COMPLETE.
<BR>
<P>4) Leaving that screen and the base system, Yast proceeded to the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other packages.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told that there are no new versions for packages &quot;gccfront&quot;, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;libgif&quot;, and &quot;ssh&quot;. For neither of these, I found any hint in the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;book (&quot;From Version to Version&quot;, section 13.2). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I was not even aware I had installed &quot;libgif&quot; and &quot;ssh&quot;, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but I know that gcc packaging may change over time, due to the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;egcs&quot;-&quot;gcc&quot;-intagretion - correct ?)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also accepted all upgrades with &quot;Uncomparable version numbers&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(packages &quot;gccinfo&quot;, &quot;libc&quot;, &quot;libcinfo&quot;, &quot;nssv1&quot;, and &quot;timezone&quot;) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as all of these had newer dates (installed Jun 1999, on CD Sep 2000), 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and started the upgrade. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately I got a message about missing dependencies. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of these were &quot;AND&quot;, so I tried &quot;AUTO&quot; to get them resolved. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But &quot;kbase(kde)&quot; was said to need &quot;glx&quot;, &quot;mesasoft&quot; (both of &quot;x3d&quot;) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR &quot;xf86_glx(x)&quot;. My only choice was &quot;Continue&quot;, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the upgrade proceeded without any problem indications. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(As described below, KDE comes up even without that prerequisite. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I do not yet know whether there are any real problems. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agreed to using the new template files ...
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My old panel configuration was kept unharmed.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The X server fell back to use display 7, the default, even though 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had it use display 5 in the old configuration. I will have to 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;look for the changed file.)
<BR>
<P>5) I then let Yast install a kernel with TGA support, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and &quot;SuSEconfig&quot; was run automatically.
<BR>
<P>6) When the new kernel booted, it failed to activate the swap device. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not yet analyzed that ... 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was offered to have some more packages automatically updated, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from CDs 2 and 3.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I had had to leave the machine during step 4, so this may have 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been caused by a timeout ? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or is this due to the ramdisk on CD 1, so that the CD could not 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be changed during step 4 ?)
<BR>
<P>7) Upon the next reboot, I was told that starting &quot;syslog&quot; failed. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my swap partition was listed correctly by &quot;swapon&quot;, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and KDE came up working (slightly changed style, it seemed). 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reset my old &quot;/etc/inittab&quot; (I use consoles 1 .. 4 only, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so the X server may use display 5). 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then called &quot;shutdown -r now&quot;, KDE + X terminated, I fell back 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;onto console 1 - and the machine hung. 
<BR>
<P>8) I waited for some time (in case any flush daemon was still running) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then dared to press the &quot;reset&quot; button. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The machine rebooted correctly, &quot;syslog&quot; was started, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it was still done by the old MILO (2.0.35) for the old kernel 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2.2.9). 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I copied the new MILO (2.2) from &quot;/boot&quot; to &quot;/dos&quot; and changed 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the &quot;OSLOADOPTIONS&quot; (maybe my old setup had been wrong ...), 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then it rebooted using all the new stuff. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MILO (2.2) again shows these distorted characters (described in 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;step 1), but the kernel messages are o.k. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some reason I have yet to check, the KDE login window does 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not offer the &quot;root&quot; (and &quot;nobody&quot; ?) user symbols any more. 
<BR>
<P>10) I will have to look for all changed configuration files, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that has to wait until next week (and an &quot;updatedb&quot; run ...). 
<BR>
<P><P>As a summary, I would say the upgrade worked without any real problems, 
<BR>
but it is noticeable that the Alpha platform is not used in so large 
<BR>
numbers as the x86 stuff, and so the coverage by tests and reports 
<BR>
is too low. 
<BR>
<P><P>However - enjoy it (and your special, individual taste) 
<BR>
and have a nice weekend, 
<BR>
