&nbsp;Hey!
<BR>
<P>I hope i am not yet a total idiot and somebody else
<BR>
has encountered that kind of problems with Netscape...
<BR>
<P>Originally in SuSe 7.0 (as well as in RH 7.0) that I tried
<BR>
there was a problem, that netscape after a few successful
<BR>
runs, just stopped working. I could open the window itself,
<BR>
but when I was trying to start browsing Netscape was simply
<BR>
dead with a message Looking for the host...
<BR>
<P>I figured that the problem was due to the file .news-src (or
<BR>
smth like this) of 0 size. After I deleted it Netscape
<BR>
continue working pretty good. I've tried version from 4.7 up to
<BR>
4.76. Same story with all of them. Now every time I it gets
<BR>
stalled at the very beginning I have to delete .news-.. file 
<BR>
an can keep on using Netscape. This is not critical, but
<BR>
still does not look very right to me.
<BR>
<P>After I solved (kind of) this problem, I discovered another one.
<BR>
I can't send messages anywhere, although I can receive them.
<BR>
I am getting an error message, smth like, that i did not
<BR>
provide a username for the smpt server and, that i should go to preferences to fix it. The problem is in that I know perfectly well how to setup Netscape preferences and the username was there from the very beginning, but Netscape simply does not see it believe me or not.
<BR>
<P>The last problem did not appear in 4.7, and I thought, that I can calm down now... =( But NO. I tried to access this server from a different Linux box, using xdm. When I tried to run Netscape it even did not open the GUI window.
<BR>
<P>May be I am just not lucky?
