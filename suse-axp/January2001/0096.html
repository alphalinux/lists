<P>
i have a Digital Personal Workstation 600a (miata) , i would like to be
<BR>
able to watch dvd in it , i'm trying a software called videolan, but i
<BR>
have some problems i would like to get some help with . 
<BR>
<P>First i gives unaligned traps (as most programs do) , but that isn't a big
<BR>
deal , the thing is that the software works much better if i use Xv
<BR>
extesions that come with XFree4.0 , i've tried to run the version that
<BR>
comes with SuSE 7.0 but it hangs up my machine (it returns me to SRM
<BR>
console when i try to run it) , is this a common bug ? is there a
<BR>
solution? 
<BR>
<P>Second thing is that i am able to run the program and exec .vob files but
<BR>
it goes very slowly (and it's 600mhz ...) i would like to know maybe a
<BR>
document or some tips for optimization the compilation of the problem for
<BR>
my platform (our platform) i have tried to read gcc manual page but i got
<BR>
nothing clear of this , also i would like to know how to force the
<BR>
compiler to use compaq's math library or anything that could make programs
<BR>
go faster.
<BR>
<P>I'm speaking with the people that make the program (videolan) at IRC
<BR>
network openprojects , were there is a #alphalinux channel also .. ,
<BR>
anyway , they've ask me if there is someway to optimize DCT (discrete
<BR>
cosine transformation [basic in graphics decompression]) under alpha
<BR>
<P>i would appriciate help and links to documents 
<BR>
<P>thanks in advance
