Hi all,
<BR>
<P>I am having difficulty with my kernel. The problem actually surfaced
<BR>
just recently. When I first updated from 6.3 to 6.4 it didn't reboot
<BR>
the machine (Avanti type AS250 4/266 now on stock SuSE 6.4 using TGA
<BR>
video card and a DEC 21040 based ethernet card (module de4x5 is
<BR>
actually loaded when I go through the boot floppy). Now the problem is
<BR>
that when I reboot from harddrive (with freshly installed TGA capable
<BR>
kernel) I don't get my network device working. It will work with the
<BR>
boot disk, though. This seems to indicate that the kernel is lacking
<BR>
the module. I tried to modprobe de4x5 but it just returns module not
<BR>
found. So, I was wondering whether this is just a deficiency in the TGA
<BR>
kernel on the CD and I need to recompile my own. Would it help to
<BR>
install the new kernel that is on the ftp site under the update
<BR>
directory?
<BR>
<P>Finally another little annoyance is that I can't create a rescue disk
<BR>
for my system. If I try to make it within YaST it will return an error
<BR>
that flashes by too fast to read and is replaced by a red rectangle
<BR>
informing me that an error occurred (duh... if it doesn't say what kind
<BR>
of error it is how should I go about fixing it?). Which files have to
<BR>
go on the rescue disk?
<BR>
<P>Thanks for any pointers to a solution to these two problems.
<BR>
<P>Alex.
<BR>
<P><PRE>
