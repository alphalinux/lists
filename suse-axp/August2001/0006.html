<P>
I resolved the problems with getting the ATI Xpert98 (RagePro)
<BR>
and the 3DFX Voodoo3 setup with SaX2 on an XP1000.
<BR>
<P>The trick is to use xf86config4 to configure the cards *and* install
<BR>
the 3.3 X related RPMs. I don't know *why* the older 3.3 modules
<BR>
are required, but without them I could not get X to start. It seems
<BR>
that one of the 3.3 packages contains the X wrapper needed for
<BR>
startx to work properly.
<BR>
<P>I now have these cards working well. Unfortunately, 3D acceleration
<BR>
is not supported on the Voodoo3 because the glide package is not
<BR>
included for Alpha.
<BR>
<P>I'm now much happier with SuSE 7.1 but I think SaX2 needs a bit
<BR>
of work. It's buggy and should have more intelligence in detecting
<BR>
which packages are needed for a working X configuration.
<BR>
<P>Good job with XawTV too! It worked out of the box after running
<BR>
the v4l setup tool.
<BR>
