<P>
<EM>&gt;   I really don't understand why SuSE imposed such a strange limit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   for the number of characters of the root password.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   How can I eliminate such a limit?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>In almost all versions of Unix (except Tru64 in C2 mode, that I know of)
<BR>
you are limited to an 8 character password.
<BR>
<P>The historical security problem in BSD Unix (and Ultrix) was that you could
<BR>
specify a password of essentially unlimited length.... however only the
<BR>
first 8 characters were ever used. The code simply tuncated the entry and
<BR>
used it, without any kind of indicatation of what was happening.
<BR>
<P>That is to say any password greater than 8 characters was truncated to
<BR>
the first 8 with no warning messages.
<BR>
<P>Consequently the password
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9a8b7c6dxxx     was exactly the same as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9a8b7c6dyyy
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12345678        since only the first 8 characteres were
<BR>
examined.
<BR>
<P>It was a rather nasty security hole. And as far as I know this problem
<BR>
still exists in most Unixes --- hence the limitation of password length
<BR>
to 8 characters. (It was easier to fix the allowed length on creation than
<BR>
to allow the longer lengths in processing.)
<BR>
<P>It is not unlike the 8 character limitation on userids. It is so deeply
<BR>
inbeded in the code that it will take years (if ever) before a userid
<BR>
longer than 8 characters is permitted.
<BR>
<P>I've been complaining about both of these issues for it seems like forever.
<BR>
Lets see now OSF/1 came out about 10 years ago... yeah forever.
<BR>
<P>At least with C2 security in Tru64 Unix, (and I assume other vendors now
<BR>
as well) you can set both the minimum and maximum password lengths, which
<BR>
is a requirement for C2 certification.
<BR>
