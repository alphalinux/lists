Hi all,
<BR>
<P>a couple of weeks ago i posted the following on suse-axp -&gt;
<BR>
<P>&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; i've just installed a 3c509b on my up1000, ide hd, agp graphics, SuSE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 6.3 AXP, kernel 2.2.16.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; modprobe detects the device correctly, then i can configure it with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ifconfig and add a route w/o problems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though it doesn't send/receive any packets - can't even ping over it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; i've not seen any indication - log output or similar - to why it's not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; working.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; i've tried the exact same configuration - even with the same card - on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pc running RedHat and it works fine. and yes - i've triplechecked the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cables, twice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dope:~ # ifconfig
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:20:AF:CC:DF:56
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;           inet addr:192.168.0.3  Bcast:192.168.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;           RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;           TX packets:9 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;           Interrupt:10 Base address:0x300
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dope:~ # ping 192.168.0.5
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; PING 192.168.0.5 (192.168.0.5): 56 data bytes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; --- 192.168.0.5 ping statistics ---
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss
</EM><BR>
&lt;/snip&gt;
<BR>
<P>i eventually checked the suse support db (which of course i should have
<BR>
done before posting.. ) and there was at least one mention of the 509 - to
<BR>
the effect that i have to switch off pnp and autoselect.
<BR>
so i downloaded the conf utility from 3Com, installed msdos(!) and the
<BR>
card in a pc and found that hey, both pnp and media autoselect were both
<BR>
already disabled.
<BR>
<P>so i thought it could be an irq problem - although /proc/interrupts said
<BR>
the current irq (10) was free i changed it to 7 and put it back in the
<BR>
alpha. the module was correctly detected - irq and dma - and as usual no
<BR>
problem with setting up i/f and route.
<BR>
though when trying to ping, the machine locked up completely - not even
<BR>
SysRq worked.
<BR>
then i tried irq 11, with the exact same non-result as with 10 -
<BR>
everything seems to work, but no packets get across - incoming or
<BR>
outgoing.
<BR>
<P>then i thought it could be suse-specific, so i got RedHat6.2 with kernel
<BR>
2.2.14 -&gt; same result.
<BR>
<P>i've also tried compiling the driver in the kernel, no difference.
<BR>
<P><P>i'm getting really rather tired of not getting _anywhere_ on this - clues
<BR>
any one?
<BR>
has no-one ever used a 3c509 on the up1k - or similar - platform?
<BR>
<P>oh and btw, AlphaBIOS does not detect the card at all, but that shouldn't
<BR>
be significant should it??
<BR>
<P><P>any and all help appreciated, even if it's 'get rid of that pice of junk
<BR>
and by a xxx'!
