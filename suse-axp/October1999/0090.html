Let me clarify my remarks about RH6.1 and MILO on EV6.  RH6.1 BETA Installer
<BR>
did not have an fdisk option from the installer, you can still use the Alt-2
<BR>
console to do your disk partitioning.  We have a copy running on our
<BR>
testdrive program on an ES40.  (<A HREF="http://www.testdrive.compaq.com">http://www.testdrive.compaq.com</A>)  We have
<BR>
LOTS of machines with Lots of OS's free and otherwise, including SuSE
<BR>
6.1(x86 + alpha), RH6.1 (x86 + alpha), RH6.0 (x86 + alpha), TurboLinux (x86
<BR>
only), Tru64, VMS, etc.  And we are waiting on a power upgrade to the lab to
<BR>
add a 8x Alpha Beowulf cluster.
<BR>
<P>Yes there is a BETA MILO for EV6 systems, however given the fact that
<BR>
Compaq/Microsoft have stopped future development on AlphaNT and only
<BR>
maintenance is being done I would not expect much of a future for MILO.
<BR>
(Personally I don't like to add BETA on top of BETA, that way I know which
<BR>
one broke)
<BR>
<P>As for BSD labeling, here are a few pointers:
<BR>
<P>1. skip the first track, this is for the health of your partition table
<BR>
(fdisk warns you) and the aboot loader.
<BR>
2. DO NOT USE THE LAST TRACK REPORTED BY FDISK.  Fdisk reports one more
<BR>
track than there is, I don't know why but using the last track (247/247)
<BR>
results in a bad filesystem, and a bad install.  There are some examples in
<BR>
the installation guide (See #3)
<BR>
3. Read the installation guide we have written:
<BR>

<BR>
<P>(Warning blatant plug)
<BR>
You may also want to check out  <A HREF="http://www.compaq.com/linux,">http://www.compaq.com/linux,</A> we have a
<BR>
collection of documentation, kernels, patches, and special deals on Linux
<BR>
Ready Compaq Alpha Workstations/Servers.
<BR>
<P>As for the UP2000, you will need to talk to Alpha Processor, Inc
<BR>
(<A HREF="http://www.alphaprocessor.com/">http://www.alphaprocessor.com/</A>) as that is their product not Compaq's.

<P><P><P>Jon,
<BR>
<P>I still have to check partition table, it was late Friday night when the
<BR>
last attempt of installation failed...
<BR>
<P>I let installer do the partitioning for UP2000(UX was fine for any way of
<BR>
installation).  My problem only appears when I tried to use Disklabeling...
<BR>
<P>RH6.1 for Alpha? was not available...is it now?
<BR>
<P>I will try to study more about BSD style labeling, but I would also
<BR>
appreciate more updates from UP2000(EV67) users of SRM booting tips. This
<BR>
seems to be bit differ from EV6.
<BR>
<P>PS: FYI, there IS beta version of MILO for EV6*
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What does your partion table look like?  FYI - letting the installer do
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; partitioning may not always be the best idea.  For example, it appears the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RH6.1 installer only uses DOS disklablels, Alpha REQUIRES BSD style
</EM><BR>
labeling
<BR>
<EM>&gt; for SRM booting, NT/MILO options not available on EV6+ systems.
