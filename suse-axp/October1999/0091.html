<P>
I have a Multia on which I have installed Suse V6.0 which was given to me
<BR>
by a friend.  The manual is in German, which I
<BR>
am unable to read.
<BR>
<P>I have a 2 GB IDE drive in this Multia onto which I have successfully
<BR>
installed Suse.  I can boot via SRM from
<BR>
a boot floppy, and the system runs beautifully.
<BR>
<P>I'd like to be able to boot from the IDE drive, but when I try to do so,
<BR>
early in the boot process, I get an error message
<BR>
<P>VFS Kernel Panic unable to mount file system.
<BR>
<P>I have the following partions on the IDE drive: hda1, hda2, hda3.  
<BR>
hda1 is msdos type and has bootlx, vmlinuz, system.map. and mounts at /boot
<BR>
hda2 is swap
<BR>
hda3 is ext2 mounted at /
<BR>
<P>I set up the ARC boot selection so that:
<BR>
<P>OSLOADER=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\LINLOAD
<BR>
OSLOADOPTIONS=boot hda1:vmlinuz root=/dev/hda3
<BR>
OSLOADFILENAME=\milo
<BR>
<P>I copied linload and noname from the \milo directory on CD1 to a msdos
<BR>
floppy, and then copied them into /boot
<BR>
after mounting the floppy via a mount -t msdos /dev/fd0 /mnt command.
<BR>
<P>I also copied the file vmlinux.gz  into /boot from my boot floppy which
<BR>
works from SRM.
<BR>
<P>I get the same error message whether I try to boot vmlinuz or vmlinux.gz.
<BR>
<P>I have made RedHat systems boot from the same type of IDE drive in a
<BR>
Multia, but that was a long time ago, and I'd rather
<BR>
be running Suse.
<BR>
<P>When I verify the boot selection in ARC, it checks OK, and when I boot this
<BR>
boot selection from ARC,
<BR>
linload then Milo starts, then MILO starts loading the kernel from the IDE
<BR>
drive, then I get the kernel panic.
<BR>
<P>What am I doing wrong??
<BR>
<P>Thanks and regards in advance
<BR>
