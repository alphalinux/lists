Hi list,
<BR>
<P>Here is my odysee with getting SuSE Linux 6.1 running on my AS 250
<BR>
4/266. Actually I am posting a rather lengthy reply letter to Stefan
<BR>
Fent from SuSE support here which details what I went through.
<BR>
Essentially it boils down to my ignorance about the booting process
<BR>
from the SRM console. The SuSE AXP manual could actually be a little
<BR>
more verbose about this and perhaps, this post will trigger someone at
<BR>
SuSE to cover it in more detail in future versions. 
<BR>
<P>Best regards, Alex.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Dear Stefan,
<BR>
<P>thanks for the quick feedback. In short: I finally got it working but
<BR>
am not convinced that your last post really made the difference. It
<BR>
looks more like your post of a week ago was the key to success. Shows
<BR>
you how little I still know about the boot process of the alpha.
<BR>
Perhaps you can suggest a pointer to read up on this topic? Anyway,
<BR>
here is what I did and got:
<BR>
<P>In reply to SuSE Support's letter who wrote on  7 Oct:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Dear Alex,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you wrote:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Okay, but what could have gone wrong? Someone on the SuSE AXP list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; mentioned that you have to specify the c partition for the *whole*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; drive. As you can see from my disklabel I did this only as far as to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; cover partitions a and b, i.e., not the tiny front section where the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; boot image is supposed to be located. Perhaps, I should change that? I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; will try it out and see what happens.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AFAIK is it not neccessary to create this partition, as this is somehow a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; control partition, that is creatd by the system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So this may be the error.
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, I rewrote the BSD disklabel. It now looks like this:
<BR>
<P>a:   255651     6039    swap                        # (Cyl.   8*-  328*)
<BR>
b:  1789557   261690    ext2                        # (Cyl. 328*- 2571*)
<BR>
<P>Then I rebooted with the aboot-tga image and the install disk. Went
<BR>
through expert mode for the installation and got into &quot;Configure Hard
<BR>
Disk Partitions&quot; menu. There I saw that no partitions had been
<BR>
recognized. Figuring that maybe this was not the right thing to do (to
<BR>
write a YaST-generated partition over the fdisk-generated BSD label) I
<BR>
exited, rebooted again but this time entered the &quot;set target
<BR>
partitions/filesystems&quot;. (The reboot seemed to be necessary since
<BR>
even though I did not write the partitions to disk which I had
<BR>
generated as a test, they hung around in this invocation of YaST). 
<BR>
There I formatted and checked sda2 which was actually recognized by YaST
<BR>
(to my relief). It didn't say anything about sda1, i.e., the swap
<BR>
partition. So, I went to the &quot;Configure Hard disk partitions&quot; menu again
<BR>
where sda2 was still not listed. However, after hitting ok on
<BR>
&quot;partitioning&quot; and then &quot;continue&quot; (still no partitions available was
<BR>
claimed) I ended up with the select swap partition which apparently was
<BR>
recognized. So I initialized it. Then I proceeded to install the
<BR>
packages and got an error right away claiming that on the following
<BR>
partitions the amount of free disk space would drop below 5%:
<BR>
device-name partition total used  free    free%  mount-point
<BR>
/dev/initrd Linux     3.9M  6.4 M -2.5 M  - 65%
<BR>
<P>Clearly, I need to partition my HD somehow. When I go into &quot;configure
<BR>
hard drive partitions&quot; again and actually try to create a partition I
<BR>
get the message:
<BR>
Device contains neither a valid DOS partition table, nor Sun disklabel.
<BR>
Building a new DOS disklabel. Changes will remain in memory only, until
<BR>
you decide to write them. After that, of course, the previous content
<BR>
won't be recoverable.
<BR>
<P>So I decided to go ahead and create the DOS disklabel and try to keep
<BR>
my swap and root partition as close as possible to the BSD disklabel.
<BR>
So I created sda1 starting from cyl. 4 with a length of 128MB. Then
<BR>
created sda2 starting from 135 all the way till the end. Initialized the
<BR>
swap partition again (just in case). The DOS label now reads
<BR>
<P>Device    Boot   Start    End    Blocks   Id    System
<BR>
/dev/sda1            4    134    131851+  82    Linux swap
<BR>
/dev/sda2          135   1018    889746   83    Linux native
<BR>
<P>Well, after that I get an error saying disk full. I hit continue and
<BR>
get back to the main YaST menu. So, now I go back to the &quot;set target
<BR>
partitions&quot; menu and find the following entries:
<BR>
<P>Device name   Blocks   Inodes   Format   FsType   Mount point  Partition
<BR>
/dev/sda2     889746    4096    Normal   ext2                  Linux
<BR>
.../initrd  536856592               No   xiafs    /
<BR>
<P>Okay, the last entry doesn't make sense at all and the root mount point
<BR>
somehow got shifted away from sda2. So I proceed to resolve this by
<BR>
selecting the proper mount points. I switch the mount point / to sda2
<BR>
and no entry to .../initrd and continue. /dev/sda2 is now created.
<BR>
<P>Now back to choose/install packages. To the default installation I add
<BR>
aboot and xtga since I think I will need them. The total installation
<BR>
will take about 740 MB leaving about 12% of the disk free. I start the
<BR>
installation, packets are loading from the CD. Installation goes okay.
<BR>
I go through the motions, configure network etc. then installation
<BR>
wants to be committed and ... hangs, again!
<BR>
<P>So, looks like I have to do this all over again. Perhaps, not creating
<BR>
the DOS disklabel this time? Okay, cold start, since I don't see any
<BR>
other way of getting out of this stuck installation. Then kill the
<BR>
partitions that were generated in YaST before using fdisk on console 2.
<BR>
Now verify that the BSD disklabel is still okay. Write to disk. Go back
<BR>
and reboot. Now, go to &quot;set target partitions&quot; in YaST. The current
<BR>
list of the filesystems contains one entry:
<BR>
Device name  Blocks  Inodes Format 
<BR>
/dev/sda2   1789557   4096   No     ext2               Linux
<BR>
<P>So I go ahead and use F6 to format that partition after I mounted it on
<BR>
/.
<BR>
Now, I won't go back into &quot;configure hard disk partitions&quot; but am
<BR>
attempting to install the packages on the distribution. Again, I choose
<BR>
standard and make sure I add aboot and xtga. Again, 12% disk space is
<BR>
left for user files. I start the install, packages are flowing, all
<BR>
seems fine. I complete and go to &quot;Finish installation and exit YaST&quot;.
<BR>
This is where the suspense begins. YaST wants me to put CD1 back in,
<BR>
which I do. I need to select a kernel and choose the second one with
<BR>
TGA support. YaST is installing the kernel. I set up time-zone and
<BR>
networking names. For now, the machine is not hooked up to the net, so
<BR>
I choose loopback only and single user machine. SuseConfig runs and
<BR>
does its thing. Now I need to press the ominous button to commit the
<BR>
installation and start the system ... and hung again! This is getting
<BR>
pretty frustrating. I can't use another console either at this stage,
<BR>
i.e., there is no reaction to Ctr-Alt-F2. 
<BR>
<P>Okay, cold boot again after 5 minutes if waiting. Maybe, I should set up
<BR>
the whole disk as &quot;unused&quot; partition c in the BSD disklabel. So, after
<BR>
doing that my BSD disklabel is being amended by the following entry:
<BR>
<P>c: 2051247    0   unused    1024  8192       # (Cyl.  1 - 2571*)
<BR>
<P>Okay, now setting up the partition. I am getting kind of used to this
<BR>
now. ... hashmarks are flowing across the screen ... loading CD2 ...
<BR>
loading CD3 ... now finishing installation with time zone and
<BR>
networking options, now coming to the ominous place where the
<BR>
installation should be committed, and it hangs again!
<BR>
<P>So, what do I do now? Perhaps try the other kernel? 
<BR>
No... didn't work either. Same problem.
<BR>
<P>OK, now going back a couple of days to SuSE support's first suggestion
<BR>
which I didn't really need thanks to R&quot;udiger Oertels's help with the
<BR>
aboot image. That's at least what I thought. 
<BR>
I am now booting from the aboot-tga disk using the string
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;boot dva0 -file /vmlinux.gz -flags &quot;root=/dev/fd0 load_ramdisk=1
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bootdevice=/dev/fd0&quot;
<BR>
<P>It complained about bootdevice=/dev/fd0 not a valid boot device but,
<BR>
wonder over wonder, I am getting prompted to supply a root password.
<BR>
This means that the installation has picked up where it had left off.
<BR>
Okay, this means that I can proceed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Okay, I rebooted several times just by necessity. I suppose with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; rebooting is meant leaving YaST with the end/reboot button or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; alternatively, committing to the installation by clicking ok at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; point where I am currently hung. I had to do this a couple of times
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; with the new dislabel in place. I even had to cold reboot a couple of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; times when YaST would hang after trying to commit to the installation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; Also you must not create ext2 Partitions on top of these Partitions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; So, if I understand this correctly it means that I should NOT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; repartition the drive with YaST? However, my impression was that YaST
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; can not read the BSD disklabel. How then will YaST know where to set
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; the mount points? I will play around with this some more today, but am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This may be a consequence of the c partition created by you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Normally, if you created the two BSD-Partitions as discribed in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manual, then rebooted, YaST should find the SWAP-partition automatically,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and show you the other partition that can be used as systempartition.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, it isn't since at this point I succeeded with the c partition
<BR>
in place but labeled unused.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; not convinced that I really understand the partitioning process and how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; BSD disklabels and the ext2 filesystem work hand in hand.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; There is no other harddisk in the box. Just the 1 GB Quantum that I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; having trouble with.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You should be aware that the standard installation is more than 1GB, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this may be a problemm, too. But you will be warned before the start of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installation, if more than 95% of your hd are needed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Don't worry I still got 12% of the hard drive left. Of course, I will
<BR>
need to buy a new HD pretty soon if this becomes my office computer. Any
<BR>
suggestions or cautions for me when selecting a hard drive?
<BR>
<P>Best regards. Alex.
<BR>
<P>P.S.: I should mention that I was happily surprised about Stefan's
<BR>
response times. Initially it took a while before SuSE support
<BR>
responded, probably because I wasn't registered yet at the time.
<BR>
However, they really were quick in following up on my repeated
<BR>
inquiries.
