<P>
I just received my SUSE Alpha AXP distribution CD's 1 - 4 with printed
<BR>
moderately incomplete manual, ordered online at SUSE web site.
<BR>
<P>The issue with CD 1 missing items is verified here also.
<BR>
Yes, I'm stuck looking at the contents of these CD's on Win98SE box until
<BR>
Linux AXP installs on my Miata 500a &amp; 600a.
<BR>
<P>CD1:\dosutils does not exist.
<BR>
CD1:\disks does not have any kernels as mentioned in the manual also.
<BR>
CD1:\disks does have Milo images for various Alpha platforms along with
<BR>
Install image.
<BR>
CD1:\setup.exe, not.
<BR>
<P>Boot instructions are incorrect, although manual says stuff about it being
<BR>
for certain configurations in this section.
<BR>
<P>So, Rawrite milo and install disks using a DOS machine with RedHat copy of
<BR>
rawrite.exe (or download)
<BR>
<P>Note to Compaq or ARC app developers:
<BR>
Run Maintenance Program is available of ARC &amp; AlphaBIOS machines.  I realize
<BR>
your focus on Linux pre-built systems are SRM-based, but that also has a way
<BR>
to run Alpha code.  It seems extremely odd that your DS/ES - Linux install
<BR>
book has (paraphrased) &quot;Use Intel DOS or NT to create boot and root/install
<BR>
floppies for installing Linux on Alpha.&quot;  I'm surprised that's not on Ms's
<BR>
&quot;Let's poke a little fun at Linux&quot; site that just went up.  &lt;big smile&gt;
<BR>
<P>Once I get this install process down to where it actually works most of the
<BR>
time, I'll drop a short note back here with trimmed-down steps.
<BR>
<P>Below is cut from the on-line suse-axp thread, so quotes are off by one.
<BR>
All of below is quoted from the list.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Hello.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am new to SuSE... And having installation problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On doc. page 15 says rawrite (in \dosutils[rawrite), but I don't see dir
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; called dosutils on axp CD01.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>That's probably because that is a x86 program designed to run on
<BR>
dos/windows for x86. I don't know of any program that could write raw disk
<BR>
under WinNT-Alpha, but correct me if I'm wrong. I see that there is a
<BR>
/dosutils directory but I don't know if it works(used a x86 machine to
<BR>
write my disks)
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Has anyone managed to boot off aboot and install disk on UP2000?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If anyone has tips web page, would anyone please advise me?
</EM><BR>
<P><P><P>BTW, although I answer any question I can it would be better to write to
<BR>
the list for answers. (I don't know _everything)...:)
<BR>
