<P>
Looks like I was too optimistic in my previous post. I am successfully
<BR>
getting the packages installed. However, once linuxrc tries to leave and
<BR>
start the system it either hangs (did so initially on the first couple
<BR>
of tries) or goes back to the SRM console (I couldn't find out what
<BR>
triggers it to either hang or to go back to the SRM console). The
<BR>
problem is at the point where the message appears:
<BR>
<P>The base system has been successfully installed. This new installed
<BR>
system will now be started in order to commit the installation.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps, the problem is to allow automatic booting from the SRM console?
<BR>
I looked up the SuSE manual where it deals with this rather sparsely on
<BR>
pages 27 and 21 under &quot;Booten from SRM console&quot; and &quot;Assign partitions
<BR>
for the SRM console.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I am also trying to use fdisk on console 2 to repartition the disk.
<BR>
Before I do that and perhaps end up doing some permanent damage to the
<BR>
system, let me run this by the list for any caution you may have about
<BR>
this:
<BR>
<P>Initially, I had YaST partition the disk into three parts, sda1 for the
<BR>
first 6 cylinders to go to /boot; sda2 for 130 cylinders to go to swap;
<BR>
and the rest (from 138 ro 1018) to go to /.
<BR>
<P>Using fdisk as described in the manual I initially discovered an
<BR>
existing BSD disklabel reading:
<BR>
<P>#   size   offset    fstype      fsize  bsize  cpg
<BR>
a:  131072       0   4.2BSD      1024   8192    16  #(Cyl. 1 - 165*)
<BR>
b:  393216  131072   unused      1024   8192        #(Cyl. 165* - 658*)
<BR>
c: 2050860       0   unused      1024   8192        #(Cyl. 1 - 2510)
<BR>
g: 1526572  524288   4.2BSD      1024   8192    16  #(Cyl. 658* - 2510*)
<BR>
<P>With no experience in using fdisk and the few pointers in the SuSE
<BR>
manual I have now come up with a new BSD disklabel of the following
<BR>
kind:
<BR>
#   size   offset    fstype      fsize  bsize  cpg
<BR>
a:  255651    6039     swap                         #(Cyl. 8*- 328*)
<BR>
b: 1789557  261690     ext2                         #(Cyl. 328* - 2571*)
<BR>
c: 2045208    6039   unused      1024   8192        #(Cyl. 8* - 2571*)
<BR>
<P>Does this look right?
<BR>
<P>I left the first 4 cylinders untouched just to be on the safe side. The
<BR>
book says to start with the *3rd block*. I am not sure whether they
<BR>
mean cylinder with that statement, since I couldn't find any reference
<BR>
to blocks in the fdisk menu. I also found that when I added new BSD
<BR>
partitions it allowed me to go to cylinder 1019 which ended up putting
<BR>
2571 in the partition table instead of 2510 which was there originally.
<BR>
The complete disklabel shows 2570 cylinders (I guess not the same
<BR>
cylinders as during generating the partitions ?).
<BR>
<P><P><P><P>Additional info to help in diagnosing the problem:
<BR>
I installed the AXP kernel with TGA support assuming that I needed it
<BR>
since I needed the aboot image with TGA built in. I repartitioned the
<BR>
whole 1 GB disk which resulted in a small boot partition sda1 which is
<BR>
DOS, a 128 MB swap partition, and the rest the root partition. The
<BR>
system has something like 96MB RAM. It is an AS 250 4/266. I am using
<BR>
the default installation off of the SuSE AXP 6.1 CD's. The aboot-tga
<BR>
image of the SuSE ftp site had helped me get past the SRM console and
<BR>
load the system up so far.
<BR>
Thanks for any pointers, Alex.
<BR>
