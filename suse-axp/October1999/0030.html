<P>
I feel your pain.
<BR>
I just endured the first two chapters of the SuSE manual 
<BR>
and it is worse, by far, than any Microsoft documentation around.
<BR>
That I'm brand new (two weeks old) to UNIX/Linux served to improve
<BR>
neither the installation process nor my disposition a whit.
<BR>
If you'll consider a newbie's input, here's what I did  on my XP1000 (and it
<BR>
worked!):
<BR>
<P>See if aboot is installed
<BR>
# rpm -q aboot
<BR>
<P>If it's not installed, you'll need to install it.
<BR>
Get to the configuration screen where you get to add/change
<BR>
your configuration. See Section 3.12.3 in the gawdawful manual.
<BR>
Highlight the 'a' series of software and hit return.
<BR>
You may notice that aboot is not selected.  Imagine that.
<BR>
Select it and hit F10 a couple times to get back to the
<BR>
screen where you can install what you've chosen.
<BR>
Let 'er rip and aboot should get installed.
<BR>
Once you've verified that aboot is installed,
<BR>
<P># swriteboot /dev/sda /boot/bootlx
<BR>
<P>and, assuming you partitioned the drive as specified
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; b dka0 -fi 2/boot/vmlinuz -fl root=/dev/sda2
</EM><BR>
<P>does the job.  
<BR>
That &quot;boot dkb0 0&quot; didn't do squat for me either,
<BR>
although I had made the requisite entry into /etc/aboot.conf
<BR>
I'm prolly missing something, but it does boot, so how bad could it be?
<BR>
Any refinement upon /correction to these instructions would be appreciated.
<BR>

<EM>&gt; Hi list,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; While I have enjoyed first steps with SuSE 6.1 on my AS 250 4/266, I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still struggling with getting it to boot the harddrive-installed kernel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; off of SRM. I followed the instructions in the booklet under 2.2.2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Booten from SRM console to the letter. However, when I try to boot by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; typing &quot;boot dkb0 0&quot; at the SRM prompt I only get an invalid device
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; error back. &lt;snip&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
