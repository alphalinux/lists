Hi folks!
<BR>
<P>It is me and my old jensenb again. I just want to ask, whether I am the
<BR>
only one to see semi-random X lock-ups?
<BR>
Every now and than X locks up and nothing seems to work. Actually magic
<BR>
sys-req still works (although i stated otherwise in an earlier posting.
<BR>
I guess it helps to compile in the features one like to use... Anyway
<BR>
the only way out is by sync'ing all disk, remount them read-only and
<BR>
reboot the system. This is by now means the way I intend to end my
<BR>
X-sessions.)
<BR>
A thing that did not change is the logging of the lock-up; there still
<BR>
is none I can detect (might be my incompetence though).
<BR>
BUT, I found out I can provoke those semi-crashes by using the
<BR>
kde-font-gadget (forgot the real name, sorry) to show the font lucida
<BR>
typewriter for example. (I am puzzled as it seems not to crash when
<BR>
showing other post-script fonts like the tex fonts (yes I like lyx to
<BR>
look like the real thing ;)).
<BR>
Any clues, anyone?
<BR>
<P>Oh, by the way Ruediger I still would be delighted if I could test your
<BR>
fat_and_bsd enabled yast.
<BR>
\rant_starts_here{
<BR>
I do not see to much sense in investing money in a distribution when I
<BR>
have to fix things like the distributions installer my self. And it is
<BR>
no issue, the the jensen is not part of the supported hardware, as you
<BR>
stated that this was a known yast-bug... Sorry for being harsh here, but
<BR>
I would like to use yast to maintain the system, at least for trivial
<BR>
things.
<BR>
}
<BR>
Apologies for any harm done to the english language...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebastian Möller
<BR>
<P>P.S.: Back in rant-mode:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could you please use this list to advertise information relevant to
<BR>
suse axp customers, like the estimated time of arrival of the already
<BR>
payed-for next release. I visit your home-page only occasionally to
<BR>
check for a fixed-yast... Oh one more thing to wine about, your axp
<BR>
product page could clearly be beautified by a link to the axp updates
<BR>
directory of your ftp server (following download updates, patches,
<BR>
bugfixes seems to point to intel 32 bit land).
<BR>
As you are taking money for it you are asking for trouble aren't you...
<BR>
And yes I have used suse intel since 4.x.x and I was quite happy, but
<BR>
this axp thing makes me shudder.
<BR>
