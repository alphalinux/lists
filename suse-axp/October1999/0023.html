<P><P>Are the softlinks to the driver set? I had to manually change the existing
<BR>
softling to the tga driver.
<BR>
<P>I don't remember which one I had to change but currently, my links are:
<BR>
<P>/usr/X11/bin/X  -&gt; /var/X11R6/bin/X -&gt; /usr/X11R6/bin/XF86_TGA
<BR>
<P>(And in case you're such a newbie as I am (absolutely no offence intended!);
<BR>
softlinks are maintained with the &quot;ln -s&quot; command, as in &quot;ln -s
<BR>
/var/X11R6/bin/X /usr/X11R6/bin/XF86_TGA&quot;. Do &quot;ln --help&quot;. I had to hunt for
<BR>
that little piece of knowledge...)

<P><P>I have used the recently-posted XF86Config file which was stated as
<BR>
working, but--
<BR>
<P>when I run (by 'startx') the system gives the following error:
<BR>
<P>The file XF86_xxxx (binary of X-server) doesn't seem to be a binary file.
<BR>
Please check it now / or reinstall a new X-server-binary.
<BR>
I'm aborting now.
<BR>
<P>I checked that the XF86_TGA was installed and it was, so I re-installed the
<BR>
package.  Same results.
<BR>
<P>I executed a &quot;file&quot; on the XF86_TGA file and this is the reply:
<BR>
<P>XF86_TGA: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, Alpha (unofficial), version 1.
<BR>
<P>Help!
<BR>
<P>thanks
<BR>
