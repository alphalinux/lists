<P>
Dear P,
<BR>
<P>thank you very much for your reply.
<BR>
<P>In reply to Duff, P's letter who wrote on  8 Oct:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I feel your pain.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I just endured the first two chapters of the SuSE manual 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and it is worse, by far, than any Microsoft documentation around.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That I'm brand new (two weeks old) to UNIX/Linux served to improve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neither the installation process nor my disposition a whit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you'll consider a newbie's input, here's what I did  on my XP1000 (and it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worked!):
</EM><BR>
<P>newbie helping newbie! You certainly did a good job with it. I got it to
<BR>
boot off the harddrive with your help.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; See if aboot is installed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; # rpm -q aboot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If it's not installed, you'll need to install it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Get to the configuration screen where you get to add/change
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your configuration. See Section 3.12.3 in the gawdawful manual.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Highlight the 'a' series of software and hit return.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You may notice that aboot is not selected.  Imagine that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Select it and hit F10 a couple times to get back to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; screen where you can install what you've chosen.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Let 'er rip and aboot should get installed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Once you've verified that aboot is installed,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; # swriteboot /dev/sda /boot/bootlx
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and, assuming you partitioned the drive as specified
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I had actually previously gone through the steps above since I figured
<BR>
I needed aboot. So that was not the problem. The problem was that the
<BR>
saving boot command for SRM:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; b dka0 -fi 2/boot/vmlinuz -fl root=/dev/sda2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>is nowhere documented in the manual (SuSE, are you listening?). Instead,
<BR>
the manual tells you to do 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;boot dkb0 0
</EM><BR>
<P>which in my case didn't get me anywhere because the boot device
<BR>
happened to be dka0 (I guess with a little more experience I could have
<BR>
guessed that). Furthermore I needed to specify the file 2/boot/vmlinuz
<BR>
even though I had specified this already in the aboot.conf file. While
<BR>
I don't necessarily mind typing this boot command string in everytime I
<BR>
reboot my machine (shouldn't happen too often anyway), it would still
<BR>
be nice to reboot it automatically. The SuSE manual tells you to &quot;set
<BR>
bootdef_dev dkb0&quot; (which should for me probably be dka0) and to &quot;set
<BR>
auto_action boot&quot;. I suppose I need to issue these commands in the
<BR>
SRM console? Then the manual continues: &quot;more detailed may be found in
<BR>
the manual of your AXP machine&quot;. Great! I don't have the manual since
<BR>
this was a donated machine that came without one. Is there a copy of the
<BR>
manual available somewhere on the web?
<BR>
<P>I think that SuSE should spend a little more time grep'ing through
<BR>
their AXP manual and throwing out stuff that is related to Intel and
<BR>
replacing it with stuff related to alpha. Perhaps, when SuSE AXP 6.3
<BR>
comes out?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; does the job.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That &quot;boot dkb0 0&quot; didn't do squat for me either,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; although I had made the requisite entry into /etc/aboot.conf
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm prolly missing something, but it does boot, so how bad could it be?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Any refinement upon /correction to these instructions would be appreciated.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; P Duff
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>P, thanks again, and have a nice day, Alex.
<BR>
<P><PRE>
