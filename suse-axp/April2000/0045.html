Hi,
<BR>
<P>I'm experiencing some problems after reinstalling my Alpha (a Noname board)
<BR>
with Suse 6.3. What happens is the well known problem that the machine
<BR>
freezes
<BR>
after MILO printed &quot;...turning on virtual addressing and jumping to the
<BR>
Linux Kernel&quot;.
<BR>
The strange thing about it is that IT WORKED FOR A FEW WEEKS after
<BR>
installing
<BR>
Suse 6.3!
<BR>
One evening I worked with the machine without problems. Then I shut it down.
<BR>
When I tried to boot it the next morning, it hung.
<BR>
My MILO is flashed into Flashmemory (Doh! Where else?). I'm not completey
<BR>
sure
<BR>
at the moment what version it is. I guess it's 2.0.30, the only one I could
<BR>
find to be flashable with fmu.gz. (Is there a version of fmu.gz carrying
<BR>
MILO 2.0.35? Where?)
<BR>
<P>Things I already tried:
<BR>
- Reflash MILO
<BR>
- Rebuild the Kernel
<BR>
Both didn't help. Another interesting point is the fact that I'm able to
<BR>
boot
<BR>
a 2.0 kernel. (I still have a Redhat 5.dunno installed in one partition.
<BR>
(Which
<BR>
is how I was able to recompile the kernel.))
<BR>
<P>So my current understanding is:
<BR>
&nbsp;- It's not an incompatibility between MILO and the kernel, since it worked
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for several weeks without problems.
<BR>
&nbsp;- It's not an incompatibility between the video card and the drivers in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kernel, for the same reason.
<BR>
&nbsp;- It's (probably) not a hardware problem, since the 2.0(.35)-Kernel boots
<BR>
and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;works without problems.
<BR>
<P>So: What is it?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike
