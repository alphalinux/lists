<P>
FYI,
<BR>
<P>I seem to have had at least some success with the ATI Rage Pro
<BR>
driver from Utal-GLX on an Alpha XP1000. Everything seems to
<BR>
be in order, but performance seems to have *dropped* relative
<BR>
to straight unaccelerated Mesa. I'm using the particles demo
<BR>
as a benchmark.
<BR>
<P>I did this on a SuSE 6.4 box, since they ship Utah-GLX on the
<BR>
Alpha. I'm sure the latest Utah-GLX could be made to work with
<BR>
Red Hat as well.
<BR>
<P>The card I used was an 8M ATI Xpert 98 PCI, with the Rage Pro
<BR>
chipset. Machine tested was an XP1000 with 256M.
<BR>
<P>First use Yast or RPM to remove mesasoft (Mesa software drivers).
<BR>
Install glx.rpm or built Utah-GLX is using Red Hat. On SuSE there
<BR>
is nothing more to do for installation.
<BR>
<P>Edit /etc/XF86Config and add:
<BR>
<P>Load &quot;glx.so&quot;
<BR>
<P>to the Module section.
<BR>
<P>You also need to disable pixmap and font cacheing in the card itself.
<BR>
Add this to the Device section:
<BR>
<P>Option &quot;no_pixmap_cache&quot;
<BR>
Option &quot;no_font_cache&quot;
<BR>
<P>If you're using SuSE's SaX tool, just choose these options from the list
<BR>
when configuring the server (check the Expert option).
<BR>
<P>No you need to set up /etc/glx.conf.
<BR>
<P>Add these lines:
<BR>
<P>mach64_dma = 3
<BR>
mach64_addr = 224
<BR>
mach64_size = 32
<BR>
<P>These are from memory...but you get the idea. Check the spelling by looking
<BR>
at
<BR>
the s3virge example at the end of the glx.conf file. Here I've set up DMA 
<BR>
transfers using 32M of my system memory (256M - 32M = 224M leftover).
<BR>
<P>You might want to enable debugging and uncomment the line for setting up the
<BR>
glx.log file. This is a good idea for a first run.
<BR>
<P>Now edit /etc/aboot.conf and change your boot line by adding the following
<BR>
to it:
<BR>
<P>mem=224M
<BR>
<P>This will reserve 32M of DMA space for the ATI card. I actually edited
<BR>
another
<BR>
entry in /etc/aboot.conf so that I could get back to my old setup if I
<BR>
mistyped
<BR>
something. This is a sane thing to do.
<BR>
<P>Reboot the system, login as root, and do the following to check everything
<BR>
is cool:
<BR>
<P>xdpyinfo | grep GLX
<BR>
<P>You should get back GLX. Check the glx.log and glx_debug.log files too if
<BR>
you set
<BR>
those up.
<BR>
<P>Run an OpenGL linked program. You may have to relink your app to get the new
<BR>
OpenGL
<BR>
libs.
<BR>
<P>When you run an OpenGL app you'll see a @@Create GLX context... written to
<BR>
your
<BR>
xterm. If you get that you're done. :-)
<BR>
<P>Now enjoy how much slower your system renders. ;-)
<BR>
<P>I only tried this in 1280x1024 resolution and 32bpp depth. Maybe that was
<BR>
too much
<BR>
for it. But it worked, and I think in theory it's supposed to be
<BR>
accelerated.
<BR>
<P>In SuSE this takes about 5 minutes. :-)
<BR>
<P>Red Hat folks...build Utah-GLX and have a go at it.
<BR>
