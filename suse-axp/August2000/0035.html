<EM>&gt; Netscape needs an environment under the user's home directory before it can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; run. (especially for java.) It's supposed to create it, but sometimes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cannot. That leads to unpredictable behaviour. NIS users might fall into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this category.

<EM>&gt; Tru64 uses the following script as /usr/bin/X11/netscape to get around the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem of the missing setup, installed as ugo excutable, it checks the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environment and then launches the &quot;real netscape.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The variable &quot;MOZILLA_HOME&quot; might be the real key.

Thank you for the answer. There is a similar (a little bit more sophisticated)
<BR>
script for starting netscape in SuSE 6.4 distribution. But it seems that this
<BR>
script sets at least MOZILLA_HOME correctly in the case of nis user as well
<BR>
as in the case of local user and creates proper ~/.netscape directory if it's
<BR>
necessary.
<BR>

<BR>
Besides, I've tried to launch netscape directly as well as using the script.
<BR>
For local users it works in both cases (at least netscape window appears), for nis
<BR>
users
<BR>
it doesn't work.
