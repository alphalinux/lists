Hi, 
<BR>
<P>I just got done upgrading to 6.4 after having fixed the problem with my
<BR>
disk (which I talked about in a previous post). Here just a quick query
<BR>
for feedback on X. It seems to be broken after the upgrade. I am using
<BR>
a TGA card which worked fine under 6.3. I am using the same XF86Config
<BR>
file which now generates a lot of errors. I did the upgrade by essentially 
<BR>
replacing every package. Perhaps the TGA driver got hosed/overwritten? 
<BR>
Where in the file system are the drivers located? There are a couple of
<BR>
things I am about to check myself, like building a new XF86Config file,
<BR>
trying to find out what happened to the TGA driver, etc., but if
<BR>
someone ran into the same problem before and already found a solution,
<BR>
I'd appreciate if I could hear about it.
<BR>
<P>Best regards, Alex.
<BR>
