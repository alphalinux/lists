<P>
I was not able to get the TGA configured with SaX. I had
<BR>
to use xf86setup to get a working config file, and then
<BR>
had to set a broken symlink from X to the installed TGA
<BR>
server. It's a pain, but it was the only way I could
<BR>
get it working. It works fine once it's installed though.
<BR>
<P>There does seem to be a graphics bug in SaX though. On
<BR>
non-TGA cards, the graphics on the display configuration
<BR>
screen (where the screen is shown in the canvas) are
<BR>
garbled.

Subject: [suse-axp] upgrade to 6.4 broke X
<BR>
<P><P>Hi, 
<BR>
<P>I just got done upgrading to 6.4 after having fixed the problem with my
<BR>
disk (which I talked about in a previous post). Here just a quick query
<BR>
for feedback on X. It seems to be broken after the upgrade. I am using
<BR>
a TGA card which worked fine under 6.3. I am using the same XF86Config
<BR>
file which now generates a lot of errors. I did the upgrade by essentially 
<BR>
replacing every package. Perhaps the TGA driver got hosed/overwritten? 
<BR>
Where in the file system are the drivers located? There are a couple of
<BR>
things I am about to check myself, like building a new XF86Config file,
<BR>
trying to find out what happened to the TGA driver, etc., but if
<BR>
someone ran into the same problem before and already found a solution,
<BR>
I'd appreciate if I could hear about it.
<BR>
<P>Best regards, Alex.
<BR>
