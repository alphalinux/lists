Hello,
<BR>
<P>I'm in the process of replacing Red Hat with SuSE on all my
<BR>
Alpha boxes. I'm gotten 6.4 to install on the Multia. I had to
<BR>
use the &quot;Minimum configuration&quot; to squeeze the install onto the
<BR>
small 500M internal disk. I still have 100M left over and I'd
<BR>
now like to put a mimimal X setup on there.
<BR>
<P>I've installed sax, the TGA server, xf86, and the tcl/tk packages.
<BR>
When I fired up sax, I didn't get the splash screen (I'm probably
<BR>
missing a few packages) and the interface hung up with a wait
<BR>
cursor. :-(
<BR>
<P>My question is, how do I determine the dependencies of a package
<BR>
when installing with YaST? I was able to install Sax despite not having
<BR>
the tcl packages, and Yast didn't complain! Red Hat RPM would fail
<BR>
on missing dependencies so that the user could have the proper
<BR>
prerequisites. Why does SuSE's installer not do this?
<BR>
<P>A more important question, what are the absolute minimum packages
<BR>
I need to install to have basic X support? I'm talking just twm and
<BR>
the basic libs. I don't have a description of what packages would
<BR>
be needed.
<BR>
<P>To SuSE...hint hint! Please add a &quot;Minimum X install&quot; option to
<BR>
the configuration screen so that the storage-challenged Multia users
<BR>
can get X going.
<BR>
<P>If anyone has a workaround though for the Sax problem I'd love to hear
<BR>
it. I've tried xf86setup and that didn't seem to work correctly either.
<BR>
<P>Thanks!
<BR>
