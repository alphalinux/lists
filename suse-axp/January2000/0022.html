Hello,
<BR>
Have been struggling with completing installation of AXP 6.1 on 164 LX
<BR>
system. yesterday trying to get printing on local printer to work,
<BR>
without success. Able to print one short document via GV in X to lp0, to
<BR>
HP Deskjet 500, and then X hung, repeatedly. 
<BR>
Well, I needed to build a custom kernel anyway, and figuring that this
<BR>
is as good a time as any set to work. first attempt did not result in
<BR>
anything that I could find; gave up on the second and third because
<BR>
suddenly the SCSI controller (ncrc875) that is installed in the system
<BR>
(and is the driver loaded by the generic kernel) is not selectable
<BR>
either in xconfig or in menuconfig (and it is too late to try command
<BR>
line). Using the sources included with SuSE 6.1--this is my first
<BR>
attmept at building a kernel.
<BR>
Have been reading all the manuals and readmes I can find, but am still
<BR>
stumped: these should be (I would think) relatively straight-forward
<BR>
tasks, nothing really outlandish. What am I missing?
<BR>
Thanks for any help,
<BR>
Aron
