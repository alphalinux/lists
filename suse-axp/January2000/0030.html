<P>
For those that want to run 
<BR>
Tru64 binaries (like Netscape.exe) on SuSE Linux, you must rebuild your
<BR>
kernel.
<BR>
<P>I need to send the enclosed information to someone at SuSE who is
<BR>
responsible for
<BR>
building the kernel that it distributed for SuSE Linux for Alpha-AXP.
<BR>
Could someone little-reply to me as to who to send such requests to?
<BR>
<P>Thanks in advance.

<P>Dear SuSE representative, who builds the kernels for distribution of SuSE
<BR>
Linux for Alpha-AXP releases:
<BR>
<P>It is essential that SuSE Linux support A.OUT binaries by default in the
<BR>
kernels distributed for Alpha-AXP.
<BR>
The source configuration distributed with SuSE Linux 6.1 and 6.3Beta for
<BR>
Alpha, 
<BR>
indicates that &quot;Kernel support for A.OUT binaries&quot; is enabled.
<BR>
However, it turns out that the source does NOT match the kernel that is
<BR>
distributed with 6.1 and 6.3Beta
<BR>
(a rather annoying problem). 
<BR>
<P>More importantly, this feature needs to be part of the default Alpha
<BR>
configuration.
<BR>
Binaries built on Alpha Tru64 Unix platforms are in A.OUT (AKA COFF) format
<BR>
and Alpha Linux platforms really must support these binaries by default.
<BR>
Red Hat Linux distributions supports these binaries by default. 
<BR>
It is essential that SuSE Linux also support A.OUT (COFF) format binaries.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From a quality perspective it would also be wise for SuSE Linux to
</EM><BR>
distribute a kernel that
<BR>
matches the source configuration as distributed in /usr/src/linux.
<BR>
<P>Please let me know if you have any questions about this.
<BR>
Also, when can we expect to see this fixed in a SuSE Linux release?
<BR>
<P>Thank you in advance for your attention in fixing this situation.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
<P>John Goshdigian
