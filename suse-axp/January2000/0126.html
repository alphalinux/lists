<P>
Last night (or more precisely sometime around 0200  this morning...) I
<BR>
finally overcome my AS200 installation problems.
<BR>
<P>Since I have had problems installing, even when I used the procedure which
<BR>
worked for Justin et al. (i.e. boot via ARC from floppies, select NCR810
<BR>
scsi modules), and the symptoms seemed to indicate some kind of CD read
<BR>
error, I hooked up my little laptop beside the AS200, booted from the
<BR>
floppies and proceeded to do an FTP installation, which worked. The only
<BR>
problem was I had to restart yast several times since I was not prompted to
<BR>
switch CD. (I understand why not...)
<BR>
<P>I then booted the installed system and copied vm_full.gz from the CD, and
<BR>
rebooted. I was not surprised when this boot failed (milo said something
<BR>
about &quot;length error&quot; when decompressing the kernel), so I once again booted
<BR>
from floppies and copied vm_full.gz via FTP from my laptop. This time the
<BR>
decompression of the kernel worked and I can boot directly from disc.
<BR>
<P>I have also sucessfully upgraded the boot block and can now boot from both
<BR>
ARC and SRM.
<BR>
<P>Now, I would dearly like to investigate the CD read problems further. Since
<BR>
I did not get any errors when I copied vm_full.gz from CD but it neverheless
<BR>
failed to decompress, I need some other simple test method. Any suggestions?
<BR>
<P><P>I would also like to state that, IMOHO, the sections in the manual covering
<BR>
ARC and SRM boot setup are woefully inadequate.
<BR>
<P>1) There is an entry in the SDB covering ARC setup, which ought to be in the
<BR>
manual, but this too fails to mention that you must yourself copy milo and
<BR>
linload.exe to disc.
<BR>
<P>2) The SRM section in the manual should mention swriteboot.
<BR>
<P><P>Enough said... Viel Spaß!
