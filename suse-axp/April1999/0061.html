Hi *,
<BR>
<P>I am having problems installing SuSE Linux 6.1 on my PWS 433a.
<BR>
I am able to boot, with a detour, I have to use the linload and milo of my
<BR>
(already installed) RH 5.2 system to boot the SuSE kernel and install
<BR>
disk. After that, I can select modules, tell the install program to
<BR>
continue the install, tell it to use the local CDROM, where it loads the
<BR>
ramdisk, and tries to start YaST. I get the splash screen, and then my box
<BR>
freezes completely.
<BR>
<P>Other problems I have encountered in my (unsuccesfull) journey are:
<BR>
<P>- The SuSE supplied linload doesn't like the fact that it doesn't get the
<BR>
floppy disk/whatever as an argument. Since I can't enter A: in both Loader
<BR>
and OS Path, (AlphaBios 5.x), I can't use the SuSE supplied linload.exe
<BR>
and milo. I am able to boot the system though, through use of my already
<BR>
installed milo.
<BR>
- The above mentioned hangup of YaSt. This may be caused by using the
<BR>
RedHat milo, but I can't be sure. I'll try again later on and let you know
<BR>
my findings.
<BR>
<P>Regards, and hope you can help,
<BR>
