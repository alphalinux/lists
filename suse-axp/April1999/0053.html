Hello Kris,
<BR>
<P>I have tried your boot kernel and this one doesn't work either.
<BR>
As stated in my mail I am not working with a noname box, but with an Alpha
<BR>
Server 2000 4/200, Sable Architecture.
<BR>
<P>When I boot your kernel, I get to
<BR>
&quot;Ok, now booting the kernel ....&quot;
<BR>
and the machine freezes.
<BR>
<P>I.m.h.o. there could be two reasons for this :
<BR>
<P>1. There is a problem with the SUSE aboot kernel. This one detects the
<BR>
right architecture, but locks the machine when
<BR>
&quot;Calibrating Delay Loop&quot;. I guess that this is the point where the CPU
<BR>
performance is determined. In case that the machine clock is involved here,
<BR>
this could be a hint to 2. (see below).
<BR>
I have successfully installed and booted the RedHat 4.2. This one goes past
<BR>
that point and boots OK. Now I want to switch to SUSE because I expect a
<BR>
better support for the Mylex 960 raid controller.
<BR>
<P>2. People have repeatedly reported problems with the clock settings on
<BR>
Alpha machines in several newsgroups.
<BR>
I have a similar problem, i.e.  when starting through the arc console I am
<BR>
every time forced to set date and time.
<BR>
After the machine has successfully booted, the date is sometimes 1911 and
<BR>
sometimes 2038 which appears to be very random.
<BR>
I have asked Compaq/Digital to send a technician and have a look into this.
<BR>
This does - of course - not explain why the Red Hat kernel works
<BR>
and the Suse doesn't.
<BR>
<P>Final question : Is there a support site of SUSE that deals with the Alpha
<BR>
stuff. On their 'normal website' in the support database I haven't found a
<BR>
single line although announced at CeBit. I am looking for different
<BR>
flavours/versions of the aboot kernel for booting through SRM.
<BR>
<P>I will keep you updated, because I think that more people will face this
<BR>
problem.
<BR>
<P>Many thanks and best regards
<BR>
Thomas Schneider
