<EM>&gt; &gt; Chances are it's some sort of Mylex based controller. How many ROM chips
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; does it have? (Are there two square sockets? Is one or both filled?). If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; there's only one ROM chip then you've got V2 firmware, which doesn't work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with Linux. If it's got both (and it really is the Mylex DAC960) then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you might be in luck.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, I agree, your RAID controller seems to be a Mylex DAC960. I'm also 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trying to set up such a controller under Linux, but been unsuccesful so far. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Dear Axel, I'll let you know what steps I've taken just in case they may be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ok for you. But first of all, I want to tell you about something I read in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ftp.digital.com. It seems that you can't install Linux directly to a Mylex 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DAC960 RAID disk, so you need and extra disk in the standard SCSI chain to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; install Linux on it and then &quot;dd&quot; it to the RAID. I haven't tested this yet, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so if you can and do so, please let me know.
</EM><BR>
.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; No distro that I've tried seems to support this controller in the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installation process. 
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FWIW, RedHat 7.0 (Yes, I know this is the SuSE list :) should be
<BR>
able to install on the DAC960 now, and I've been told that some SRMs will
<BR>
see a DAC960 and boot from it....though I don't know for which platforms.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You can upgrade the V2 cards to V3, but it requires a 2nd ROM chip, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; nobody seems to make them anymore!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BTW, Mr. Payne, as you seem to know quite about this hardware, I'd like to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ask you if you know something about the PDU model of the Mylex DAC960 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; controller. I've browsed Mylex's web page and it seems to not exist, but 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that's the model printed on a sticker on my controller. Any light you could 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; throw (or anybody else, of course) would be of great help. Thanks in advance.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ummm...do you have a Mylex or a DEC card? If I remember correctly Mylex
<BR>
sold them to Digital who put in their own firmware and placed their own
<BR>
parts numbers on it. So if you have a DEC card, the numbers you're seeing
<BR>
will be DEC part numbers not Mylex.
