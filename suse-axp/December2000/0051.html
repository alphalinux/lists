<EM>&gt; Chances are it's some sort of Mylex based controller. How many ROM chips
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does it have? (Are there two square sockets? Is one or both filled?). If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there's only one ROM chip then you've got V2 firmware, which doesn't work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with Linux. If it's got both (and it really is the Mylex DAC960) then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you might be in luck.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I agree, your RAID controller seems to be a Mylex DAC960. I'm also 
<BR>
trying to set up such a controller under Linux, but been unsuccesful so far. 
<BR>
Dear Axel, I'll let you know what steps I've taken just in case they may be 
<BR>
ok for you. But first of all, I want to tell you about something I read in 
<BR>
ftp.digital.com. It seems that you can't install Linux directly to a Mylex 
<BR>
DAC960 RAID disk, so you need and extra disk in the standard SCSI chain to 
<BR>
install Linux on it and then &quot;dd&quot; it to the RAID. I haven't tested this yet, 
<BR>
so if you can and do so, please let me know.
<BR>
<P>No distro that I've tried seems to support this controller in the 
<BR>
installation process. Only SuSE 6.4 (7.0 doesn't include the module, what can 
<BR>
quite confirm what I've said above) said that it couldn't start the module 
<BR>
because &quot;the resource was already busy&quot; (?). Anyway, try SuSE 6.4 and load 
<BR>
the module (you may be luckier). BTW, not even the Jumpstart CD from Compaq 
<BR>
includes support for Mylex DAC960 (too bad!).
<BR>
<P>I'd advise you to download the two floppy images from ftp.digital.com (don't 
<BR>
remember the directory, but just search for a &quot;Mylex&quot; one). They can be used 
<BR>
to boot an Alpha system which has a Mylex DAC960 installed. Try them and see 
<BR>
if the work for you.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You can upgrade the V2 cards to V3, but it requires a 2nd ROM chip, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nobody seems to make them anymore!
</EM><BR>
<P>BTW, Mr. Payne, as you seem to know quite about this hardware, I'd like to 
<BR>
ask you if you know something about the PDU model of the Mylex DAC960 
<BR>
controller. I've browsed Mylex's web page and it seems to not exist, but 
<BR>
that's the model printed on a sticker on my controller. Any light you could 
<BR>
throw (or anybody else, of course) would be of great help. Thanks in advance.
<BR>
<P><PRE>
