Hi there !
I am totaly new in linux and in alpha, so excuse me, if i ask "stupid
things"...

I bought an old alpha-box at an online-auktion, but i think the man who
sold it did not know, what he had there -
i think he took it out of the waste...

So i have no documentation, which machine i have here, is there anybody
who can help me identify my machine
i give You all the facts i could get out of the box:

Processor ID: 21064
Processor Revision: 3
System Revision: 0x1
Processor speed: 166.66Mhz
Physical Memory: 80MB

Firmware: Version 4.58   990105.0918

Harddisc (SCSI) DEC   RZ28B  (C) DEC0006   (~2GB)
CD-ROM: TOSHIBA CD-ROM XM-5701TA0557


Compaq Graphic-card (S3-Chip: 86C385)

the name of the motherboard is not sure - maybe it's a EB66+ (some
people at an austrian alpha dealer said so...)


so, i'm searching for someone who can give me more information, what box

i have here and if i need a
new firmware and where i can get it, and, when i have it - how to
install it.


My current problem is, how to install a new (IDE) harddisk (maxtor 30GB)

in my system...
I have SuSE LiNUX 6.4 running now, but when i install the harddisk, the
computer stops
the bootsequence after:

"ide: Assuming 40Mhz sy<stem bus speed for PI0 modes; override with
idebus=xx
hda: Maxtor 33073H4, ATA DISK drive
hda: IRQ probe failed (0)
hda: IRQ probe failed (0)
hda: IRQ probe failed (0)"

after that output, the system stops, and only reacts on the power-switch

:(

ok enough for today (and - excuse my terrible english)

greetings
otto adam
