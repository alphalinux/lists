Hi!
<BR>
There seem to be problems using X in SuSE 7.0 and Ruffian boards.
<BR>
<P>I tried it with my old ATI 3D Rage Pro card and yesterday with a SiS 6326.
<BR>
The ATI card used to work perfectly on SuSE 6.3.
<BR>
<P>Both X servers (Mach64 and SVGA, XFree 3.3.6) produced the same error messages:
<BR>
None of the configured devices could be found, but the found card is exactly
<BR>
the configured one (X puts these in (--) ...)
<BR>
<P>A mail of Andreas Czerniak on the suse-axp mailing list indicates,
<BR>
that he has the same problems with his Ruffian system.
<BR>
<P>So: Is there anybody out here, who has a running X on a Ruffian board
<BR>
in SuSE 7.0?
<BR>
<P>Do the newer RedHat distributions have the same problems?
<BR>
<P>Thanks for any hint,
<BR>
Martin.
<BR>
<P>PS: I tried the old milo, the 2.2.18 kernel and a kernel compile
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with -O, but nothing helped.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, i tried downgrading to the X system of SuSE 6.3, too -
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but i did not succeed with it.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps i should downgrade libc, too?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other components should not affect X when started by 'X'.
<BR>
