<EM>&gt; Yes, that's what I knew about this machine. In fact, I asked Compaq about it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and they told me that the DS5000 lacks some CPU instructions so only NT could 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be installed on it (they obviously didn't consider the existance of Linux). I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; haven't seen any MILO for the DS5000 either, so if you're confirming this, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'll keep on trying through the SRM console.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ha! The stuff these people will tell you....truth is they will run Tru64
<BR>
and OpenVMS just fine (with supported hardware). There's just a variable
<BR>
you must set in NVRAM on bootup for these OSs to run. Can remember it off
<BR>
the top of my head, but I'm sure it's in the axp-list archives.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Lacking an instruction&quot;....it's the same CPU! amazing :)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I read in ftp.digital.com that the solution would be to install Linux on a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SCSI disk and then &quot;dd&quot; the installation on the RAID. What do you think of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this? Would it work with my RAID controller? Is there something I could do to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make it work, maybe update the firmware?
</EM><BR>
<P>Which SRM version are you at? Note that if you're &lt;5.3, you'll have to
<BR>
update to 5.3, then get to the latest from there. Can't guarantee it'll

see it thought. As for the dd idea....should work, have never triedit

myself.
