<P><P>I could never get a ViRGE to be recognized by SRM on the Multia.
<BR>
Switch over to ARC and you should get it to recognize the ViRGE.
<BR>
You also have to boot with the proper kernel. There is a TGA and
<BR>
a non-TGA kernel. You'll have to experiment to see which &quot;number&quot;
<BR>
kernel that is on the CD. I think there are only 6 choices. :-)

<P><P><P><P>Hello all,
<BR>
<P>the weekend is over and I installed the new SuSE Linux 7.0 on my Multia. I
<BR>
upgraded the firmware of the box to the latest level that was ever
<BR>
released, switched to the SRM console, booted from the Compaq Jumpstart CD
<BR>
and prepared the Disk for installation. After fiddling around with boot
<BR>
parameters for a short time I managed to boot from the SuSE CD and
<BR>
installed the system. The installed system booted from SRM without
<BR>
problems. Never before I managed to set up an Alpha with Linux so fast!
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately ther is one small problem left:
<BR>
<P>SRM sends all output to the onboard TGA adapter and seems not to initialize
<BR>
the additional ViRGE/DX PCI adapter. Before I updated the system, all
<BR>
output went to the ViRGE/DX board. Is there any possibility to disable the
<BR>
onboard TGA and use the PCI-VGA adapter instead? Do I have to go back to
<BR>
the ARC firmware? Did I miss something during the firmware upgrade?
<BR>
<P>I would be happy about any hint!
<BR>
<P>best regards
<BR>
