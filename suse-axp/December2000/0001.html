Hi!
<BR>
i got my copy of AXP-7.0 on Saturday and immediately tried to install it.
<BR>
I did a new install although i ran 6.3 quite happily so far since i wanted
<BR>
to repartition my hard disk anyway.
<BR>
I have a ruffian board with an ATI graphics card.
<BR>
<P>This is what i found:
<BR>
1. The installation went a lot smoother than it did in 6.3 (and before).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially i am now able to boot with only one floppy.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not try booting from CD, since i never managed to do that, before.
<BR>
<P>2. I had trouble to boot from hard drive, because MILO did not find
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the kernel (component is not a directory or something like that).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I finally found out the reason: Milo (2.2.*) isn't able to boot large partitions.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I split my (unfortunately only nearly) empty 2 GB /usr/local into a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a small /boot and a big /usr/local partition and it worked immediately.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps a small hint would be helpful, here. The only warning i got was about
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my larger than 1024 cylinder hard drive, but that didn't cause any problems.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The funny thing about that was, that the warning was about lilo).
<BR>
<P>3. I had problems with killproc, e.g. it didn't kill atd, inetd and another
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;daemon i forgot. I did a 'init 1' and then 'init 2' and got errors from the latter.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried the command manually, and it didn't work either. I run a vanilla 2.2.17
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kernel (with /proc support of course). I don't know, whether this problem shows up
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in SuSE's 2.2.16 kernel, too. killall atd worked.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;killproc returned success, but did not kill anything.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps other people should try this out, too.
<BR>
<P>4. The support http addresses mentioned in the book don't exist:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.suse.com/Customer/index.html">http://www.suse.com/Customer/index.html</A> (page 419)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.suse.de/e/register.html">http://www.suse.de/e/register.html</A> (page 420)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work. SuSE should at least provide a link to the correct pages
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on their servers.
<BR>
<P>5. The registration codes used to be in the book (cover page),
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but mine seems to lack one.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps there is a post card, which contains it among the advertising in the box.
<BR>
<P>6. I got a t-shirt from SuSE, because there is no german version of the AXP version.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks!
<BR>
<P>7. Now the bad part: My X stopped working completely.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As i mentioned before, i ran 6.3 happily for a long time now. Unfortunately, i don't
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know the exact name of ATI's card. It seems that they change names so often, that it's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not worth to write it on their installation guide.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I first tried sax but got an errror (in ~root/Startup*): winfo command not found.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assume this is a follow up problem, because winfo should be built into tcl.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I use Xfree 3.3.6, because 4.0 didn't like my ATI card.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not able to bring up X and so i tried to copy my old /etc/XF86CONFIG file
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the new setup, but it didn't work with XF86_Mach64. I even produced the same
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;error messages with the 6.3's XF86_Mach64 server - that is really strange, since
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this configuration worked without any problem, before.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If i manage to find my registration code, i will try the hotline for that.
<BR>
<P>Here are the details (this is with my working 6.3. XF86CONFIG file):
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
This is the error message:
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than the above date, look for a newer version before reporting

<P>I tried the ATI 3D Rage Pro and a few other ATI cards, too, but this didn't work, either.

The deleted mode lines are not used, i only use 1024x768.

There came up error messages about incomplete card database entries if i remember

correctly mostly about Trident cards.
