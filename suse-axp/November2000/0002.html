<EM>&gt;   I'm trying to install SUSE 6.3 (over RH 6.0) on an 164SX.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Your problem is trying to install SUSE 6.3 on an Alpha -- as if it was a PC.
<BR>
<P>Boot off the 6.3 CD-rom from the SRM, and installation takes off merilly.
<BR>
<P>X works fine, depending upon what graphics cards you have. If you have a
<BR>
PowerStorm card, you're out of luck. There are no Linux Drivers for the
<BR>
cards. Evans and Sutherland evidently won't allow them to be written even
<BR>
though Compaq has offered to port the Tru64 drivers over to Alpha Linux.
<BR>
{I suspect primarily because the PowerStorm cards are seriously obsolete.
<BR>
E&amp;S Current cards are based on a totally new chipset.)
<BR>
<P>Also, check out the Compaq &quot;Alpha Jump Start&quot; cd. You can download it and
<BR>
burn your own or wait about 4-8 weeks to get one (free) in the mail.

<P><EM>&gt;   ----FRUSTRATION VENT-------
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   I have been using LINUX for 5 years on Intel platforms and I've had many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   problems, however they paled next to Alpha. Suse seems to have a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Alpha list and I like Suse installs on Intel, but COMPAQ(DEC) has the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   most confusing ARC-AlphaBIOS-SRM-MILO mess. The documentation seems to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   be 3 years (1997) out of date. I notice that the Suse manual doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   even mention AlphaBIOS. I spent many-many hours installing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   RedHat 6.0 but X seems all screwed up and there is NO support. When I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   compare performance it seems to run 50-100% fasted for the same clock
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   speed, but Compaq doesn't seem to support the Alpha for beans. They are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   killing their own product through neglect and it seems so sad (although
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   DEC did a terrible job as well). 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   A year ago our company evaluated the Alpha, but it is so poorly supported
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   and difficult to use that the better performance wasn't worth the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   hassle. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   ----END FRUSTRATION VENT-------
</EM><BR>
<P>It's called &quot;Stealh Marketing&quot; -- Digital patented the idea, and Compaq has
<BR>
bought into it lock-stock and barrel.
<BR>
<P>However, the good news is -- both the High Performance Technical (HPC)
<BR>
market and the VMS market has been ignoring that fact and have been
<BR>
promoting the Alpha up and down the street ... successfully!
<BR>
<P>Maybe the &quot;Unix Games&quot; about to start will mark a change in the overall
<BR>
marketing visibility of Unix on Alpha... only time will tell.
<BR>
