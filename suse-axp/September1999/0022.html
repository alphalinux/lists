Hi Ruediger!
<BR>
Thank you very much for your prompt reply.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Well it should. Do you have a second disk with DOS-partitions on it ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In this case yast on 6.1-axp was still faulty, but this has been fixed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; internally (to be included in the next release.)
</EM><BR>
Unfortunately I do have a fat partitioned disk (sda) on my system so I
<BR>
am really looking forward to the next distribution (or could I
<BR>
alpha/beta/gamme test your new internal yast revision). Oh well as I did
<BR>
not want to give up I installed the 6.1 on a 0.5gb MO drive, the
<BR>
installation was painless so it does work with jensen ;). I was even
<BR>
able to use (from the mo system) the install_to_directory feature of
<BR>
yast, it did put all the selected packages there and checked all
<BR>
dependencies (which I did not with my previous installation) and ran the
<BR>
post-install scripts. Quite nice I' say; the hard disk yast still tries
<BR>
to reinstall the system but everything runs healthier now.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; install.inf is created by linuxrc to pass information to yast. In order to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; detect partitions, yast tries an &quot;fdisk -l&quot; and if this yields no parttions,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it scans for bsd-disklabels using fdisk.
</EM><BR>
Using the install.inf of to recent x86 suse installations and according
<BR>
df and fdisk -l outputs I was able to make some sense out of this
<BR>
structure (still have no real clue what the fourth number from the right
<BR>
in each File systems: line means). Also using yast -d debug file helped
<BR>
my understanding a lot.
<BR>
Well one more question, after the previously described hd-installation
<BR>
yast still does not recognize the bsd-disk although install.inf contains
<BR>
the right line (generated from the &quot;fat-on-mo&quot;-yast), shouldn't yast
<BR>
parse this file and use the given info's ... (reminds me that I have to
<BR>
check whether some stale install.inf's are lying around /etc or
<BR>
/var/lib/YaST).
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Any messages in syslog about this ? What kind of graphics card is used ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Does it happen on a loaded or idle system ?
</EM><BR>
No syslog no messages, the card is a elsa winner 1000 isa/eisa in
<BR>
eisa-modus (firmware is 1.7) with the one default MB of vram.
<BR>
