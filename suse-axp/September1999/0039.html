<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Hi!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I updated the BIOS to version 1.32.062 instead of 1.32.061 but the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; computer still lock up on first boot. Perhaps it is a hardware error...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Has anyone tested USB with alpha? I thought I'd give it a try and see.

<EM>&gt; Hi Mattias,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sounds like a hardware error to me, keyboard-connection, keyboard or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mainboard itself in worst case. Once I went for support to one of our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; customers, because his keyboard wasn´t recognized, and it turned out that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he by mistake just did use the wrong connection on his Alpha UX. There is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; two PS/2 connectors, one is for keyboard, the other for PS/2 mouse. the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mouse-port does not work for keyboards.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, it's not the wrong port. Though if it is, then my mouse and keyboard
<BR>
works extremly well with the wrong ports... Not very likely...:)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; No, I did not test USB with Alpha yet, the first model with USB will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shipping in Octobre99, hopefully. The Alpha21264 UP1000 or UP2000 is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only Alpha with USB I know of. Maybe some SuSE engineers had their early
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tests.
</EM><BR>
<P>What I meant was if someone has tested an addin card with USB on. Does
<BR>
such a card work i Linux/Alpha. Perhaps I will try it, but if someone has
<BR>
tested and it doesn't work at all, then maybe I will reconsider.
<BR>
<P>When I used WinNT Alpha the keyboard still locked but NT started anyway
<BR>
and by the time it started the keyboard was fully functional.
