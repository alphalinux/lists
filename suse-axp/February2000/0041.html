Well, IMHO, it's infinitely better to have Netscape 4.7 on AlphaLinux now
<BR>
than Mozilla at an unspecified time in the future. I will certainly switch
<BR>
to Mozilla once it is mature, but for the moment, NS is the answer to my
<BR>
prayers.
<BR>
<P>It's the same old story as in AlphaNT vs. x86NT: How are you going to get
<BR>
people to adopt the Alpha, an undisputably better technology, when even the
<BR>
most basic desktop applications, like a decent browser, isn't available. In
<BR>
the AlphaNT case, it was the lack of Office compatibility which killed it.
<BR>
<P>Please, note also that the really good thing with Netscape for AlphaLinux
<BR>
being released by Compaq, is not that we now can run Netscape, but that we
<BR>
have more binary compatibility with Tru64 since we got necessary libraries,
<BR>
too.

<EM>&gt; &gt; The problem is Compaq/Netscape, not Suse. You (we) have to convince them

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Compaq's got a good reason for doing it.  The more folks they can show
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are using Netscape on Linux/Alpha, the better the case for getting some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real, live support for it from Netscape.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I can't agree with that. First, do you think Linux would
<BR>
be as successful if they required people to register before downloading?
<BR>
Second, There's not going to be a Netscape for AlphaLinux and I would say
<BR>
that anybody starting work on this today would be wasting time. Mozilla is
<BR>
the next version of NS and that already runs on AlphaLinux.
<BR>
<P>I've been through this with Q already, the requiremnt of tracking the
<BR>
downloads is a political one within Compaq, Netscape actually has nothing
<BR>
to do with this (well, other than it is their product).
