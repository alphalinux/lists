Hi list,
<BR>
<P>I have that same problem - though on a PC164 with EB firmware.
<BR>
For a long time, I thought the problem related to hardware, as
<BR>
I believe freezes are typically caused by unacknowledged
<BR>
interrupts. Then I thought the problem to be related to
<BR>
masquerading and ipchains. But in the end, the SuSE kernel
<BR>
(2.2.13) simply locks up. This happens between five and 30
<BR>
minutes from boot. I do suspect some I/O or amount of I/O to
<BR>
be the problem, but cannot come closer. It is a &quot;byzantine&quot;
<BR>
problem in that it cannot be reproduced just by creating the
<BR>
same circumstances.
<BR>
<P>Using /etc/full_vm.gz as a replacement just makes the problem
<BR>
worse (i.e., locks up almost instantaneuosly).
<BR>
<P>However, I had an old 2.2.3 kernel from a red hat distribution
<BR>
compiled by myself. This does not lock up the machine - but
<BR>
compiling the SuSE kernel 2.2.13 with the same options (and any
<BR>
new ones turned off) does not solve the problem.
<BR>
<P>So I conclude that something has happened between 2.2.3 and
<BR>
2.2.13 that makes the latter unusable on PC164 systems.
<BR>
<P><P>Regards,
<BR>
<P>Maz

<BR>
<P>Howdy everybody,
<BR>
<P>The installation worked great, as I said yesterday, and now I'm in the
<BR>
middle of setting up the system the way I like it to be.  However, I've
<BR>
noticed a couple of very strange lockups, where the system simply
<BR>
freezes.
<BR>
<P>I can't find exactly what's causing it (I haven't looked really
<BR>
closely), but the last one happened while starting up YaST from the
<BR>
command line.  I don't have X11 running on the machine.
<BR>
<P>Has anybody seen this, or should I dig deeper and try to discover what's
<BR>
causing it?
<BR>
<P><PRE>
