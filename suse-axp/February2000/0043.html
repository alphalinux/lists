&lt;Personal opinion warning ON&gt;
<BR>
<P>The Alphas have always had way better *system* performance. No bottlenecks.
<BR>
I bet there are several on this list who, like me, are running the latest
<BR>
versions of Linux/NT/VMS/whatever on their *old* Alphas, and they're still
<BR>
happily running at about the same perceived speed as ever. Only the absolute
<BR>
top-of-the-line x86 systems of comparative age are still able to boot, let
<BR>
alone run, NT at any usable performance levels.
<BR>
<P>Witness the Athlon. It owes its sucess to the Alpha bus technology, licensed
<BR>
from Digital, which gives it system performance and load resilience.
<BR>
<P>Where would we be if Intel had been the sole player in the field?
<BR>
<P>Of course I would like to have newer Alphas, but the ur-models I'm using
<BR>
(AS200, Multia) are still giving me adequate performance for the simple
<BR>
tasks I'm using them for, at (I believe) a rock-solid reliability that I've
<BR>
never got from any other platform (except my Vaxen...) that I've used. My
<BR>
only problem is getting the applications I need, native on Alpha, under any
<BR>
Alpha-OS. Thus I applaud being able to run Tru64 applications on AlphaLinux,
<BR>
since this broadens the available software spectrum by orders of magnitude.

<P><P><P><EM>&gt; Well, IMHO, it's infinitely better to have Netscape 4.7 on 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AlphaLinux now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than Mozilla at an unspecified time in the future. I will 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certainly switch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to Mozilla once it is mature, but for the moment, NS is the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; answer to my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prayers.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've been using the i386 mozilla M12 and it's not that bad.   I must say
<BR>
when it crashes it crashes cleanly.   I's come a long way since the earlier
<BR>
versions.   It does render fast.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; It's the same old story as in AlphaNT vs. x86NT: How are you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people to adopt the Alpha, an undisputably better technology, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when even the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most basic desktop applications, like a decent browser, isn't 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; available. In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the AlphaNT case, it was the lack of Office compatibility 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which killed it.
</EM><BR>
<P>The issue is always price.   Why buy an alpha 600Mhz machine for $4500.
<BR>
When you can get a 500MHz pentium for say $2000.   I don't think   Digital
<BR>
ever wanted to take on the PC market really they wanted to hit the &quot;lower
<BR>
high end&quot; market niche.    When the merced/itanium comes along Alpha's gonna
<BR>
have to start REALLY competing.   Just like people moved from the 486 to the
<BR>
pentium so will they move to itanium and then 
<BR>
Alpha processors become another AMD or they become another Apple.
<BR>
I don't know why or how but my newly acquired alpha has the same 'feel' as
<BR>
Mac 7200 I used to have it's probably psychological.     The guy on the
<BR>
street doesn't care about subtleties he cares about how fast for how much.
<BR>
BTW I sold that Mac (90MHz) and bought a PII 266 with the money I got for
<BR>
it!
<BR>
<P>I'm not 100% sure of the advantages that RISC has (besides heat and power
<BR>
consumption) since these days the speed difference between differnet
<BR>
archtecturs of chips are narrowing can anyone point me in the direction of
<BR>
some comparitive literature?.
