Hi list,
<BR>
<P>I was finally able to get SuSE AXP 6.3 up and running on my AS250 4/266
<BR>
thanks to the new TGA kernels that R&quot;udiger supplied last night.
<BR>
<P>However, in the installation process the device names for my two
<BR>
harddrives somehow got switched around. What used to be sda became sdb
<BR>
and vice versa. Since I didn't pay enough attention I partitioned and
<BR>
formatted the wrong drive and thus overrode what was there originally
<BR>
together with my previous 6.1 installation. Well, that should not have
<BR>
been a big deal since I was planning a complete fresh install after some
<BR>
initial testing anyway. Unfortunately, what has happened in the process
<BR>
now is that SRM doesn't recognize block 0 of dka0 as a valid boot block
<BR>
anymore. After noticing my error I repartitioned the drive manually and
<BR>
wrote the BSD disklabels to it leaving the first couple of blocks
<BR>
unassigned. Thus the disklabels on /dev/sdb (which used to be
<BR>
/dev/sda) now look like this:
<BR>
<P>#	size	offset		type		fsize bsize cpg
<BR>
<P>a:     18117     14091        ext2                 # (Cyl.   8 - 16)
<BR>
b:    263703     32208        swap                 # (Cyl.  17 - 147)
<BR>
c:   2049234         0      unused                 # (Cyl.   1 - 1018)
<BR>
d:   1753323    295911        ext2                 # (Cyl. 148 - 1018)
<BR>
<P>Trying to boot with the command
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; boot dka0 -fl 0
</EM><BR>
produces the following error: 
<BR>
block 0 of dka0.0.0.6.0 is not a valid boot block 
<BR>
bootstrap failure
<BR>
<P>Looks like my boot block on dka0 got trashed and I need to repair it
<BR>
somehow. Can someone please give me pointers as to how to do that?
<BR>
<P>Mind you that SRM still recognizes /dev/sdb as dka0 while /dev/sda is
<BR>
recognized as dkb0.
<BR>
<P>TIA, Alex.
<BR>
