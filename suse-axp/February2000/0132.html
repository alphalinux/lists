<P>
Two questions arising from trying to RTFM:
<BR>
<P>1.  Section 2.1.7 tells me I &quot;must change the block size of the
<BR>
partitions [to be mounted as / and /boot] to 1024 Bytes, and it advises
<BR>
me that more information on this point can be found in Section 3.3.9. 
<BR>
But, I find no mention of block size choices (as opposed to sizing
<BR>
partitions themselves) in 3.3.9.  Near the end of Section 3.3.10, there
<BR>
is an italicized heading &quot;Block size,&quot; but the adjacent text addresses
<BR>
other variables reached by using the &quot;F5 Expert option&quot; but does not
<BR>
address the &quot;block size&quot; variable.  It looks as though someone intended
<BR>
to write some info, but forgot.
<BR>
<P>2.  In Section 2.1.7, there is a graphical rectangle drawn around a
<BR>
section of text and a warning triangle posted in the margin.  The text
<BR>
in the rectangle advises that default block size in fdisk is currently
<BR>
4096 bytes, a size not supported by MILO or ABOOT.  However, I find this
<BR>
confusing because:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;a.  Either the fdisk whose default block size is 4096 bytes has
<BR>
already been corrected by the SuSE install process (because the F5
<BR>
screen shows the default Block size for every ext2fs file system set up
<BR>
in the install process is already 1024 bytes)--in which case, the needed
<BR>
change has already been made and why the emphatic warning that making
<BR>
this change is &quot;absolutely essential&quot;; or,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;b.  Perhaps the Install manual text should refer to some other
<BR>
variable, such as inode density, which the SuSE install does set to 4096
<BR>
bytes.
<BR>
<P>What _should_ the manual say?
<BR>
<P><P>BTW, in Section 2.1.7, the sentence containing the statement, &quot;the block
<BR>
size of the partitions in / and /boot (in our example, /dev/sda2 and
<BR>
/dev/sda4)&quot; seems to list the partitions backwards rather than
<BR>
respectively and seems wrong as to /dev/sda2.  Or, am I looking at the
<BR>
wrong example? The only example I found was a list of partition names on
<BR>
the prior page, where /boot is listed first and / is listed fourth. 
<BR>
Wouldn't that make / and /boot /dev/sda4 and /dev/sda1, respectively?
<BR>
<P>Maybe I'm relying too much on the manual here, but I find it less than
<BR>
helpful.
