Hi,
<BR>
<P>maybe a stupid problem with an obvious solution...
<BR>
<P>I've got a up1000, 21264 600Mhz API bundle, IDE hd, SuSE 6.3.
<BR>
With the machine came an installation disk, containing a 2.2.13 kernel to
<BR>
use when installing RedHat or SuSE.
<BR>
Most things work fine, as long as i _only_ use the API-supplied kernel.
<BR>
Configuring and compiling a new kernel (lx_suse-2.2.13.SuSE-6.rpm) also
<BR>
works fine, but when i install it on my dos boot partition and try to
<BR>
boot it, the machine locks up after loading the kernel with no output
<BR>
whatsoever - just a blinking cursor in the corner of the screen.
<BR>
On the UP1k installation disk there was also a kernel configuration file,
<BR>
which i presume is the settings they've used. Still, even compiling with
<BR>
the same config i can't boot the new kernel.
<BR>
I'm booting from APB:
<BR>
bootl up1000.pal newkernel.gz root=/dev/hda6
<BR>
<P>i've searched around for info on this, but there doesn't seem to be much
<BR>
available on up1000 and SuSE. I've seen suggestions on adding a
<BR>
'fake_initrd' boot parameter, but this doesn't work either.
<BR>
<P>Seems to me API must have patched the kernel to make it work, but i can't
<BR>
find anything on their homesite and the vendor isn't much help either.
<BR>
<P>any suggestions?
<BR>
all help appreciated, as this is my first alpha and i'm feeling a bit
<BR>
lost...
<BR>
