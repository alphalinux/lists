<EM>&gt; I do not know if there is around any version of a loader (be it milo or

<EM>&gt; Nothing says that you have to load your kernels from the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; partition, or even the same device, as used by a root file system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In particular, for test purposes, you can load your kernel from a

<EM>&gt; floppy.

<P>The vendor partitioned the hard disk for me that way.  I would not do
<BR>
that way if I were him.  The vendor dismisses such a limitation 
<BR>
in the case of Alphas.  Who is right?
<BR>
<P>Anyway, my observation so far does not say that the above comment made by 
<BR>
Michal is correct.  Distinction is clearly there between 2.2.15 and
<BR>
2.2.16.  It appears that it does not matter where the kernel is located in
<BR>
a partition greater than 4GB.
<BR>
<P>I heard that there is a format change in the compressed kernel for 
<BR>
aboot or milo to pick up between 2.2.x and 2.3.x.  This kind of thing
<BR>
really dissuade me to work with Linux/Alpha.
<BR>
<P>I would not tamper with glibc myself.  Is it one of those things which 
<BR>
I should I rely on the distro version update of RedHat or SuSE?
<BR>
<P>Please help.
