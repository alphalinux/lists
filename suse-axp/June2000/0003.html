it.

<EM>&gt; : You might be able to get it to boot direct from the CD with:

<EM>&gt; Just tried that - same problem.  It hangs right after aboot says it's
</EM><BR>
starting
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the kernel.  I also tried it with &quot;vm_small.gz&quot; but the same thing
</EM><BR>
happened.
<BR>
<P>What kind of graphics card are you using ? If its a DEC21030 (TGA) you
<BR>
have to use the bootdisk

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I also tried using the ARC console but I apparently didn't get it right or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it had problems with that too.  It would get to the point where there was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a line of &quot;-&quot; across the screen and then hang.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On another note, the machine does work fine - I've had OpenBSD and NetBSD
</EM><BR>
on
<BR>
<EM>&gt; it so I know it works.  I would really like to get Linux on there, though,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since that's what I'm familiar with.

<P>I have successfully installed Suse 6.3 on a Multia. The Multia indeed has
<BR>
TGA graphics (on-board), so it is necessary to use aboot_tga_xx. I don't
<BR>
know if it works with a SCSI floppy since my Multia has a built-in
<BR>
(non-SCSI) floppy.
<BR>
<P>Most things work fine and it is really not so slow - even with just 40 MB
<BR>
memory. If you want to use the on-board ethernet adapter, you must use the
<BR>
DEC435 selection (not TULIP) and set the io address to 8800.
<BR>
<P>Three things I would like to mention, maybe Suse can improve in 6.4 or 6.5:
<BR>
<P>1. KDE doesn't work. Maybe the reason is that the Multia is an EV4 machine
<BR>
(21066 chip).
<BR>
<P>2. With Kernel 2.2.13 sax doesn't work propery. The system hangs when I try
<BR>
to adjust the mouse settings or to access the settings for RAMDAC and video
<BR>
memory. However, these things do work when I use the 2.2.9 kernel which I
<BR>
downloaded when first I also could not get the Multia running because the
<BR>
6.3 standard kernel does not work with TGA machines.
<BR>
<P>3. In LINUXRC the Multia is (correctly) recognised as a NONAME machine.
<BR>
However, after configuration and booting the system says it is an unknown
<BR>
EV56 machine. Maybe the problem is that I do not use the standard Multia
<BR>
firmware (Rev. 3.8), but the firmware provided by COMPAQ for Multia to work
<BR>
with OpenVMS. This firmware identifies the Multia as AXPpci MT233 (or
<BR>
similar).
<BR>
<P>I like the Multia.  It is so nicely compact and has everything you need:
<BR>
SCSI on-board, TGA on-board, ethernet on-board, floppy, IDE on-board, sound
<BR>
on-board and two PCMCIA slots. Unfortunately I had no time yet to get IDE,
<BR>
sound and PCMCIA running with Suse.
<BR>
<P>I currently have two Multias at home, one with Suse 6.3 and one with OpenVMS
<BR>
;-).
<BR>
Both are equipped with an internal  IBM DDRS 4.3 GB SCSI disk, so
<BR>
unfortunately I cannot use the PCI slot.
<BR>
<P>By the way: For private use you can obtain a free OpenVMS license from
<BR>
www.montagar.com. It is worth trying, extremely stable and flexible. I also
<BR>
successfully configured a SCSI-coupled OpenVMS-Cluster with the two Multias.
<BR>
<P>Kind regards
