Subject: Re: [suse-axp] can't boot new kernel on up1000
<P><P>Basically 2.2.13 doesn't support that system. We (API) did a patch to
2.2.13 that allowed us to create a kernel that would work for
SuSE/RedHat. We didn't distibute that patch because....it was in 2.2.14
and later. So, go and grab yourself 2.2.14 or later (2.2.16 would be
good) and use the .config on the floppy (there may be a few new options
there).

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; maybe a stupid problem with an obvious solution...
&gt; 
&gt; I've got a up1000, 21264 600Mhz API bundle, IDE hd, SuSE 6.3.
&gt; With the machine came an installation disk, containing a 2.2.13 kernel to
&gt; use when installing RedHat or SuSE.
&gt; Most things work fine, as long as i _only_ use the API-supplied kernel.
&gt; Configuring and compiling a new kernel (lx_suse-2.2.13.SuSE-6.rpm) also
&gt; works fine, but when i install it on my dos boot partition and try to
&gt; boot it, the machine locks up after loading the kernel with no output
&gt; whatsoever - just a blinking cursor in the corner of the screen.
&gt; On the UP1k installation disk there was also a kernel configuration file,
&gt; which i presume is the settings they've used. Still, even compiling with
&gt; the same config i can't boot the new kernel.
&gt; I'm booting from APB:
&gt; bootl up1000.pal newkernel.gz root=/dev/hda6
&gt; 
&gt; i've searched around for info on this, but there doesn't seem to be much
&gt; available on up1000 and SuSE. I've seen suggestions on adding a
&gt; 'fake_initrd' boot parameter, but this doesn't work either.
&gt; 
&gt; Seems to me API must have patched the kernel to make it work, but i can't
&gt; find anything on their homesite and the vendor isn't much help either.
&gt; 
&gt; any suggestions?
&gt; all help appreciated, as this is my first alpha and i'm feeling a bit
&gt; lost...
