<P><EM>&gt; Hi there!

<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Attention, this is a complaint, do not read any further if you dislike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unjustified whinig...
</EM><BR>
it's not unjustified, just that ...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You have been warned...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am trying to locate the 6.4-axp-evaluation/beta.iso file. The only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; place where I found it was ftp.alphalinux.org.
</EM><BR>
That iso was not really meant for public use. More or less I threw things
<BR>
together for a number of people with specific tests. alphalinux.org spotted
<BR>
the image and I agreed to publish it there because I wanted quick results
<BR>
since I was already weeks behind schedule ...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Shouldn't it be also to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; found somewhwere on ftp.suse.com? As much as I like the alphalinux.org
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; service the connection is quite slow and I would rather use a local
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; download location in europe (in germany to be precise).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; After the experience with 6.1 and 6.3 I am not going to buy 6.4 before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trying it, as my jensen is not supported... (I do think that SuSE deserves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money for their distribution, but it has to be usable to some degree...)
</EM><BR>
Fully agreed. As for the Jensen: I've included a jensen kernel on CD
<BR>
and on a special disk image that basically runs, but the de4x5-driver is
<BR>
broken for eisa-cards and I did not manage to patch it into a usable state.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; While I am at it, why is there no real german ftp-site of suse (mirrors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are nice but where is the real mccoy?)?
</EM><BR>
Due to the limited bandwidth of ftp.suse.de, it never really was a full
<BR>
suse-download site. Some of the german mirrors (gwdg.de for example)
<BR>
have everything and more ftp.suse.de could ever offer.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; And ftp.suse.com is a bit on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; x86 side one might complain. For example /pub/suse_update/ points deep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into intel-land without proper notification to the user or excape routes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for other platforms (come on, a link ala axp or ppc is not so hard to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incorporate, given that I mentioned this fact months ago).
</EM><BR>
Well: pub/suse_update is an historical artefact, that was meant to be
<BR>
deleted almost two years ago (but we had to keep it because many links
<BR>
pointed there...). ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/$ARCH/update/$VERSION is
<BR>
the current hierarchy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well that is it for now.
</EM><BR>
Hoping to have explained a bit ...
