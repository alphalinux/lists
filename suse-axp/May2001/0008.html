Hi:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my first experience with SuSE Linux and I must say that in 
<BR>
general it is excellent. Top marks go to &quot;robustness&quot;.. Especially the 
<BR>
installer, it never crashed for me and I gave it a serious workout on the 
<BR>
Jensen. The install on my Alphastation 4/255 233 mHz was simple and
<BR>
the machine is running almost flawlessly using kernel 2.2.19.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area that you have done well in is supplying a usefull variety of 
<BR>
applications and utilities in a very clean, well integrated way.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I attempted to install it on one of my three DEC Axp 150 machines in 
<BR>
&quot;expert&quot; mode, YaST. That went very well once I was acustomed to the way YaST 
<BR>
works. Unfortunately the Jensen kernel that you supply does not have compiled 
<BR>
in AHA-1740 disk controller support. RedHat and Debian distributions are 
<BR>
making the same mistake. If it was not for this one item the Jensen install 
<BR>
would be as flawless as the other Alpha family machines. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please fix this and I will definately buy your Alpha Edition.  Remember 
<BR>
too that the Jensen was the first Alpha machine to run Linux.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also check to see that linux/arch/alpha/kernel/traps.c has been
<BR>
patched. I saw &quot;awk&quot; running 98% of the CPU time, which is a sure sign that 
<BR>
you need to apply the patch.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only bugs that I see on the Alphastation are some &quot;unaligned access 
<BR>
error&quot; coming from X (Matrox driver) and a couple of the &quot;KDE Control Center&quot; 
<BR>
utilities crashed with SEGV faults. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall I think you have an excellent distribution and I look forward to 
<BR>
using it. Please fix Jensen support and I'll be a very happy customer.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
<P>&lt;/Duane&gt;
<BR>
