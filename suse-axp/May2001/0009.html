Hi!
<BR>
<P>I want to report some bugs I found in the SuSE Linux AXP 7.1.
<BR>
<P>Fist I want do describe my hardware:
<BR>
- mainboard: DEC AlphaPC 164
<BR>
- RAM: 8x16MB = 128 MB
<BR>
- CPU: 21164 500 MHz
<BR>
- Graphic: Elsa Winner 2000 AVI PCI
<BR>
- Controller: Adaptec 2940AU PCI
<BR>
- HD: 2x Quantum 2GB (I set the 2940 to 8MB for these devices because of
<BR>
scsi timeout problems.)
<BR>
- cd-rom: Pioneer
<BR>
- Network: Via Rhine II Network Card PCI
<BR>
- Sound: (ALS4000 (Avance logic PCI))
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soundblaster 16 pnp ISA
<BR>
<P>First bug: This bug was reallly annoying: The milo for my machine isn´t
<BR>
working. What happened ist that the milo just stops loading with the
<BR>
message: &quot;switching to PAL at 0x0&quot; (I hope I remember correctly). The
<BR>
previous milo switched after this message from the blue ARC screen to
<BR>
the black milo screen with the bios messages of the graphics card. So I
<BR>
had to use the old milo. But with the old milo it wasn't possibile to
<BR>
boot from CD. It seems to be impossible to load the kernel from a fat
<BR>
partition or a too big ext2 partition! So I had to make a disk with the
<BR>
right kernel (wich by the way ist the right one?). And a second disk
<BR>
with the initrd for installation. I HOPE YOU'LL FIND THE BUG, BECAUSE
<BR>
THE 2.4 KERNEL CAN USUALLY NOT BOOTED WITH THE OLD MILO!!!
<BR>
<P>Second bug: If you set the file permission to secure in yast1 some
<BR>
programs won't start (for example Netscape, mc)
<BR>
<P>Third bug: graphical installation doesn't work: I get a screen wich
<BR>
looks like cutted into peices, so that you can't recognize anything!
<BR>
<P>Fourth bug: some programs under KDE2 (for example komqueror) crashes
<BR>
with SEGV after a time. Also some Problems with Netscape: I can't sent
<BR>
any e-mails because Netscape says: There's no user name for the smtp
<BR>
server.... But I set a username! After some time it seems that I cannot
<BR>
start some new programs. It looks like they can't connect to the
<BR>
x-server, but there aren't any error messages.
<BR>
<P>Fifth bug: You fogot the alsa drivers. So I can't use the ALS4000
<BR>
soundcard and I have to use the Soundblaster wich ist supported by the
<BR>
kernel.
<BR>
<P>But the other expierience I made was quite good. The system is running
<BR>
stable and all programs are working fine.
<BR>
<P>Have fun
<BR>
