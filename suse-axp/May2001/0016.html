(OT question at the top, but more important unfortunately)
<BR>
<P>1)
<BR>
I'm having som serious problems with my Ruffian. It almost never boots
<BR>
anymore. The monitor doesn't come out of it's sleep mode, and when it
<BR>
finally does the computer hangs on the Initializin ECC memory. Sometimes
<BR>
(1 out of 100) it acually does succeed in booting Linux.
<BR>
<P>This has (probably) started with me adding some more memory to the
<BR>
computer. 2x Kingston PC133 ECC 256MB ram, but when I remove that new
<BR>
memory the computer still refuses to boot.
<BR>
<P>I've tried to reseat the DIMMs, changing banks, swapping places and using
<BR>
only that or the old memory, but nothing seem to work.
<BR>
The computer is a 21164A @ 533 with 128MB memory before and 640MB after.
<BR>
The only other changes I've done is added a SBLive! and a OHCI usb
<BR>
adapter. The harddrive also seem to give in, but that probably has more to
<BR>
do with the following problem:
<BR>
<P><P>2)
<BR>
The computer, once it boots, hangs _hard_ every once and awhile. Mostly
<BR>
when I'm using X but also when I'm compiling large pieces of
<BR>
software(KDE2, kernel). This results in a fsck on the next boot, but that
<BR>
rarely succeeds. More often the fsck process bombs out with either
<BR>
segmentation fault or unexpected inconsistency.
<BR>
<P>When I try to run e2fsck in repair mode the process sometimes collaps
<BR>
with a kernel oops. Most often something like: &quot;Tried to kill idle
<BR>
thread&quot;...
<BR>
<P>The kernel I'm running is 2.4.4pre7. Has that kernel any problem on the
<BR>
Alpha or is it just my computer giving up? Perhaps I should try the 2.2.19
<BR>
kernel, or what do you think? Please advice.
<BR>
<P><P>Thanks in advance.
