Hi All,
<BR>
<P>I have just completed installing SuSe 6.3 in a dpw 433a (without the
<BR>
on-board SCSI. Classis ?). Anyway the system is configured as follows:
<BR>
<P>128 M RAM
<BR>
2 x 2GByte SCSI drives
<BR>
Adaptec 2940 UW controller
<BR>
433 MHz 21164A Alpha
<BR>
A Powerstorm graphics card (Impressive number of heat sinks)
<BR>
AlphaBIOS 5.7
<BR>
<P>I had a few problems with the installation due to the SuSe Miata Milo not
<BR>
seeing the CD-ROM, and the SRM not seeing the Adaptec.  However with
<BR>
suitable messing around these were overcome.
<BR>
<P>It would appear that the powerstorm cards are not supported under linux (At
<BR>
least if they are no one's admitting it). OK I need graphics card.  Having
<BR>
browsed around the mailing lists, it appeared that others were using a
<BR>
Matrox G200 PCI card with some success, and the G200 was also sold with pdw
<BR>
systems at one point.  Encourage by this I purchased one from Matrox(Matrox
<BR>
Millenium with 8MB SDRAM).
<BR>
<P>I removed the powerstorm card and slotted the Matrox into one of the bottom
<BR>
64 bit PCI slots and powered up. The system goes into BIOS emulation and
<BR>
complains of an unsupported PCI configuration.  If I boot up under SRM, the
<BR>
screen goes a pleasant light green color, and the machine hangs. Under
<BR>
AlphaBIOS, with the card in, there is no apparent way to get the machine to
<BR>
BOOT.
<BR>
<P>Anyway the questions, if anyone may know the answer, are as follows:
<BR>
<P>a) Is there anyway to get beyond the AlphaBios with this card on this
<BR>
machine ?
<BR>
b) If the answer above is no, does anyone know of a card that can get beyond
<BR>
the AlphaBIOS.
<BR>
<P>If anyone can help I would greatly appreciate it.
<BR>
<P>Thanks.
<BR>
