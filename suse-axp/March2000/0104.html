<P>
Today, I was told a very interesting story.
<BR>
On an SRM-console machine, &quot;aboot&quot; process is specific to 
<BR>
each installation.
<BR>
<P>Well. I really don't understand what it means.  Let me tell you 
<BR>
my situation.  The vendor installed  RedHat-6.1 on an LVD hard disk 
<BR>
connected to the single-ended SCSI connector of UP2000 motherboard.
<BR>
He should have connected it to the LVD SCSI connector.
<BR>
<P>He told me that because he created aboot while he was installing
<BR>
RedHat-6.1 with the connector hooked to the single-ended SCSI connector, 
<BR>
simply switching the SCSI cable to the correct LVD SCSI connector
<BR>
would not let me use the existing &quot;aboot&quot;.  So he said the boot 
<BR>
will fail.
<BR>
<P>Yes, I failed to boot the machine when I experimented with the 
<BR>
SCSI cable connection.
<BR>
<P>I thought that AlphaBIOS is a lot more flexible than SRM-console.
<BR>
SRM-console is like  Windows95, in which whenever the system is 
<BR>
moving between hard disks one should reinstall everything from 
<BR>
scratch.
<BR>
<P>Is my understanding all correct?  This time, I really want to 
<BR>
succeed in installing SuSE-6.3 without the CDROM set.  So, Mr. R. O.,
<BR>
please help.
<BR>
<P>Thank you.
<BR>
<P>Best regards,
<BR>
