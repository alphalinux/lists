<EM>&gt; Today, I was told a very interesting story.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On an SRM-console machine, &quot;aboot&quot; process is specific to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; each installation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well. I really don't understand what it means.  Let me tell you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my situation.  The vendor installed  RedHat-6.1 on an LVD hard disk 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connected to the single-ended SCSI connector of UP2000 motherboard.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; He should have connected it to the LVD SCSI connector.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; He told me that because he created aboot while he was installing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RedHat-6.1 with the connector hooked to the single-ended SCSI connector, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simply switching the SCSI cable to the correct LVD SCSI connector
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would not let me use the existing &quot;aboot&quot;.  So he said the boot 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will fail.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, I failed to boot the machine when I experimented with the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SCSI cable connection.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then someting else is wrong, the UP2000 only has 1 SCSI channel, so moving
<BR>
the connector from the SE port to the LVD port should have no effect.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I thought that AlphaBIOS is a lot more flexible than SRM-console.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SRM-console is like  Windows95, in which whenever the system is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; moving between hard disks one should reinstall everything from 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scratch.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, AlphaBIOS is going away, and while there is a MILO for the
<BR>
DP264/UP2000 it's not very reliable, you are in much better shape using
<BR>
SRM console.
<BR>
<P>Now, do you know which version of SRM is on this machine? It's printed out
<BR>
when SRM starts and it will be either V5.5-82 or A5.5-82 (unless somebody
<BR>
else has already changed it). The difference is that A5.5-82 will see and
<BR>
be able to use the onboard SCSI, V5.5-82 will not.
