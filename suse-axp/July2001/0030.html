<P>
Thanks for the reply...I will get you more details tonight. I have
<BR>
the RagePro in the machine now so I can test with that. I'll try out
<BR>
Sax2, Sax, and xf86config4 and capture the logs. I currently am using
<BR>
the 4.1 RPMs that you put out after the release. Nice suggestion on
<BR>
twm...the card is detected (from ServerLog) and I do get an X display,
<BR>
so it may be just what you are saying.
<BR>
<P>Sorry for any harsh words, but I am used to SuSE &quot;just working&quot; out of
<BR>
the box and that hasn't been my experience with this release. Usually
<BR>
this is how my experiences with Red Hat have been.
<BR>

<BR>
<P><P>* Champigny, Michael &lt;Michael.Champigny@compaq.com&gt; [010730 16:12]:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I tried Sax2 (fails), 
</EM><BR>
details? black screen? system hanging? Error message?
<BR>
Could you please send me /var/log/SaX.log?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Sax (fails)
</EM><BR>
details?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and xf86config (generates an XF86Config
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; file which fails with a parsing error).
</EM><BR>
<P>for the new 4.0.x/4.1 packages, please make sure you also try
<BR>
xf86config4.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Can someone send me a working ATI RagePro XF86Config that I can use or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tell me what I'm doing wrong? As I say, this card worked without a problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with 6.4.
</EM><BR>
<P>Do you have an old, working XF86Config for that card? That could help to
<BR>
push
<BR>
our SaX2 developer to the right direction.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I then tried the XFree86-4.1 RPMS in the ~stepan area. I got a little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; farther
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with this card...I got a classic cross-hatch background with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; X cursor (which I could move) but it just sat there. I had to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my way out. Once again, I could not bring X up. And I never got the Sax2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; banner.
</EM><BR>
<P>Please send me /var/log/SaX.log for that one, too.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Then I plugged in a Voodoo3. The same thing happened...I could not get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a configuration file working with either Sax2, Sax or xf86config. Please
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; help!
</EM><BR>
<P>as above.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One more thing...I tried selecting 3D support for the Voodoo3 (even though
</EM><BR>
I
<BR>
<EM>&gt; couldn't even get a 2D display to work) and it said I needed the glidedri
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; package...which isn't even on the CD! The SaX.log file shows a problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; running
</EM><BR>
Sorry for that one.. 3d support didn't make it into the last release.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; the &quot;ps&quot; command (looks like a bad usage message). SaX bombs with a tcl
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stack dump. This pretty much sums up the quality of SuSE 7.1 from what
</EM><BR>
I've
<BR>
<EM>&gt; seen so far. I am using a standard stock workstation XP1000 (EV6) with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; common
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; video cards...hasn't any of this even been tested?
</EM><BR>
Aaah.. wait,... try to rename twm to twm.old and make a link from another
<BR>
windowmanager there. Might be a bug in twm that causes the TCL trouble.
<BR>
Please tell me whether this helps. I could put out a workaround package for
<BR>
it then.
<BR>
