Hello Michael, 
<BR>
there was some discussion recently on the redhat list where
<BR>
(I think it was Michal) elucidated that aboot might not be able to boot
<BR>
kernels that are over 2GB away from the begining of a partition. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As SuSE IIRC installs the kernel after all the other stuff (and
<BR>
plenty of other stuff I might add) it seems possible that this troubles
<BR>
you. I guess that YAST, if not otherwise told, will create a small
<BR>
partition and mount it under /boot automatically. (The beauty of aboot
<BR>
compared to old lilos seems to be that while lilo was affected by the
<BR>
cylinder number, aboot is said to be affected by the offset from the start
<BR>
of its partition. Therefore it seems possible to move the /boot partition
<BR>
to the end of the disk. That way the swap partition might get more of the
<BR>
fast outer sectors of the disk).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my as1000 5/300 the SuSE supplied kernel (RC1 though, not the
<BR>
release version) was of no real use, as it always insisted upon checking
<BR>
the filesystems on all ext2 partitions claiming they were dirty. A self
<BR>
compiled 2.4.6 fixed that (for the price of breaking some cd issues).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW SAX2 is a sure bet to bring X to a grindig halt on ev5 (eve
<BR>
the 4.1.0 suse supplied some time ago), but this will probably not affect
<BR>
your xp1000.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess the take home message is try to move the kernel before the
<BR>
2 gb limit in your partition or re-partition the disk with 'support' for
<BR>
/boot. Maybe it suffices to cut a small, say 16MB strip away from your
<BR>
swap partition to make room for the kernel without having to reinstall
<BR>
from scratch.  
<BR>
<P>Ahoi
<BR>

<EM>&gt; I just got the SuSE 7.1 AXP boxset and I've run into a couple of problems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; First off, I could not get YaST2 to display with my Mach64 based ATI Expert

<EM>&gt; 98. I then chose non-graphical Yast and the installtion went fine. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; selected

<EM>&gt; the 2.4 kernel and the installer copied the kernel to the disk.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I rebooted and set up my SRM variables using boot flag 0. Aboot 0.7
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complained about not finding boot/vmlinuz.gz. Why did it do this? My disk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has 2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; partitions...a swap and then /. I don't need a seperate FAT /boot partition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kernel, do I? I thought that was only for ARC.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SRM version is 5.9, machine is an XP1000, everything is stock.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Please help...let me know what to set the SRM vars to so I can boot, and let
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me know if I need more than just the 2 partitions. I don't remember creating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seperate boot partition on this machine in the past with 6.4 but maybe I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forgot about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it.
