<P>
Has anyone had success with an ATI Xpert Play 98 (RagePro chipset)? I used
<BR>
this card perfectly with 6.4 using the Mach64 server. This is an XP1000
<BR>
workstation. I cannot get the graphical installer to work with it, and after
<BR>
the install I could not get a working XF86Config.
<BR>
<P>I tried Sax2 (fails), Sax (fails), and xf86config (generates an XF86Config
<BR>
file which fails with a parsing error).
<BR>
<P>Can someone send me a working ATI RagePro XF86Config that I can use or
<BR>
tell me what I'm doing wrong? As I say, this card worked without a problem
<BR>
with 6.4.
<BR>
<P>I then tried the XFree86-4.1 RPMS in the ~stepan area. I got a little
<BR>
farther
<BR>
with this card...I got a classic cross-hatch background with the
<BR>
X cursor (which I could move) but it just sat there. I had to
<BR>
CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE
<BR>
my way out. Once again, I could not bring X up. And I never got the Sax2
<BR>
banner.
<BR>
<P>Then I plugged in a Voodoo3. The same thing happened...I could not get
<BR>
a configuration file working with either Sax2, Sax or xf86config. Please
<BR>
help!
<BR>
I find it hard to believe that neither of these common cards are working
<BR>
with
<BR>
this release.
<BR>
<P>One more thing...I tried selecting 3D support for the Voodoo3 (even though I
<BR>
couldn't even get a 2D display to work) and it said I needed the glidedri
<BR>
package...which isn't even on the CD! The SaX.log file shows a problem
<BR>
running
<BR>
the &quot;ps&quot; command (looks like a bad usage message). SaX bombs with a tcl
<BR>
stack dump. This pretty much sums up the quality of SuSE 7.1 from what I've
<BR>
seen so far. I am using a standard stock workstation XP1000 (EV6) with
<BR>
common
<BR>
video cards...hasn't any of this even been tested?
<BR>
<P>I think I'm about ready to switch to Red Hat or back to 6.4. It just doesn't
<BR>
seem like 7.1 had much testing and I'm disappointed with the quality. It's
<BR>
been one headache after another. I can't even get the damn keyboard to
<BR>
work right with this release. :-( Very frustrating.
<BR>
