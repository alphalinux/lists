Hi,
<BR>
<P>I did get this working with the de4x5 driver. The problem was that
<BR>
during the install (when configuring ethernet) I selected de4x5
<BR>
for the module and it automatically added a parameter (can't think
<BR>
of the name but I think the value was 0x100). That doesn't work
<BR>
at least in my configuration (I got ethernet errors on startup).
<BR>
I solved it by autoprobing for kernel modules before the install
<BR>
(using linuxrc) and it picked up de4x5 without putting in the bad
<BR>
default parameter. I think the installer should not put any
<BR>
defaults there for that module.
<BR>
<P>Now if only somehow could help me with:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;- getting an ATI Expert 98 (Mach64) going (works with 6.4)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- getting a US keyboard mapping with X under KDE (works in 6.4)
<BR>

<P><P>* Champigny, Michael &lt;Michael.Champigny@compaq.com&gt; [010726 15:30]:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm now having trouble with ethernet. I have a stock XP1000 with it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; builtin ethernet controller. During the install I'm asked which eth0
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; module I want to load. I tried DE4*5 and Tulip.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The DE4*5 just gives me insmod failure messages at boot time, and Tulip
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; causes a segmentation fault and stops the boot process!
</EM><BR>
<P>What are the error messages you get with the de4x5 driver? On the stock
<BR>
XP1000 we got from Compaq, both drivers from the SuSE 7.1 AXP work 
<BR>
flawlessly. The machine is running with the tulip driver since I installed
<BR>
it from scratch after the 7.1 AXP release. very strange. Could you please
<BR>
send me an output of lspci -vv, hopefully we can track down the problem
<BR>
then.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   - Kernel 2.4 is named differently but no mention of this in the manual.
</EM><BR>
When SuSE 7.1 was released, Kernel 2.4 was far from being production usable.
<BR>
We packed it as a gimmick, but no one would seriously want to run any kernel
<BR>
before 2.4.5 on an Alpha except for bug hunting ;) We're sorry that the
<BR>
changes
<BR>
regarding 2.4 were not mentioned in the manual.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Best regards / Mit freundlichen Grüßen,
<BR>
