<P>
<EM>&gt; sounds like for some reason german keyboard mapping was activated. Could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you please send me any system information or starting point to debug your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trouble? The /etc/X11/XF86Config would be very useful. Are for example Y
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Z swapped, too?
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks, I'll try out your suggestion. I was trying the
<BR>
&quot;Personalization-&gt;Country &amp; Language&quot;
<BR>
settings under the control center. I will re-run Sax2 and try to get it
<BR>
remapped from
<BR>
there. I can't recall whether Y and Z were swapped but I'll test that out. I
<BR>
get several
<BR>
European characters and many special characters like &quot;#&quot; and &quot;'&quot; are
<BR>
different than US
<BR>
layouts.
<BR>
<P>By the way, my Matrox Mystique card does work well. It is the only card I've
<BR>
had any success
<BR>
with. I will try Virge and Permedia2 also, but for the record, ATI Mach64
<BR>
and Voodoo3 seem
<BR>
horribly broken and I can't get and XF86config that works with them.
<BR>
