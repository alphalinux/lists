<P>
I am not able to get a working X with my ATI Xpert 98 RagePro.
<BR>
This same card worked perfectly on this machine with SuSE 6.4
<BR>
so I don't see what changed. 
<BR>
<P>The installer figured out I needed the Mach64 server and that I needed
<BR>
XFree86 3.3.6 (since apparently 4.0.2 doesn't support this older
<BR>
card).
<BR>
<P>After installing 7.1 I tried to start up SaX. No luck...it gave me an error
<BR>
message (can't remember what it was). I then tried xf86config.
<BR>
I went through the configuration and tried to run X (ie. startx).
<BR>
<P>The ServerLog reported something like:
<BR>
<P>*** No configured device found ***
<BR>
<P>Fatal Error: No screens found
<BR>
<P>What is going on? Does anyone have a Mach64 RagePro card working
<BR>
on Alpha and SuSE 7.1, and if so can you tell me how you got a working
<BR>
config? I don't have the option of downloading Stefan's 4.1 packages at
<BR>
this point so I have to make this work.
<BR>
<P>Also, is there any way to get SaX running? It might be better at generating
<BR>
a working XF86Config file. I seem to recall that this depends on the SVGA
<BR>
server and maybe I don't have that installed (will have to check later).
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
<P>/Michael
