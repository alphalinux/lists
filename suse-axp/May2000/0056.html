<P>
<EM>&gt; Now that Compaq has made their own Alpha-optimised C and C++ compilers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; available, I'm sure more Alpha-users than myself have toyed with the idea of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; building a complete Linux with these tools. I'd guess most of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; applications and much of the kernel would compile without changes, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ofcourse, that's unknown until tested. I know there are assembler parts and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inline code which probably would not compile, but these might possibly be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; left to Gnu tools.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Has SuSE any plans to try this (or have you already done so)?
</EM><BR>
<P>This means compiling all required libraries to each and every
<BR>
program. I've made the ccc my default compiler, but it needs libraries
<BR>
compiled with ccc as well. I tried to compile kde(1 and 2) and the result
<BR>
was disappointing..:( 
<BR>
<P>I'm not sure wheter it applies to all libraries, but at least qt must be
<BR>
compiled with ccc(which I have already done).
<BR>
<P>The kernel is probably another chapter, it makes full use of gcc-extension
<BR>
and will most certainly fail to compile correctly, even small parts of it.
<BR>
<P>Our only hope is to compile ccc-binaries static, which, in theory, will
<BR>
work wonders. The drawback with that approach is the size of the
<BR>
binaries...
