Oops... that a part I wouldn't have tried unless I had to... Since the code
<BR>
CCC generates performs so much better (depending ofcourse on the code in
<BR>
question), and your code already runs on Tru64, isn't it both easier and
<BR>
better to compile with CCC? Or have you, too, problems with library
<BR>
compatibility?
<BR>
<P>If this issue with the libraries is such a great hassle as it apparently is,
<BR>
I'd urge all of you who are trying use CCC and C++ to formally log this as a
<BR>
complaint with the CCC support. I have no reason to believe Compaq wouldn't
<BR>
listen, especially when the project is something really serious.

<EM>&gt; Now that Compaq has made their own Alpha-optimised C and C++ compilers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; available, I'm sure more Alpha-users than myself have toyed with the idea
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; building a complete Linux with these tools. I'd guess most of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; applications and much of the kernel would compile without changes, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ofcourse, that's unknown until tested. I know there are assembler parts
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; inline code which probably would not compile, but these might possibly be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; left to Gnu tools. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I am just taking C code in the other direction: 
<BR>
from Alpha-Tru64 (Compaq compiler) to Alpha-Linux (gcc), 
<BR>
works immediately (admitted, it does not use compiler-specific features 
<BR>
and was written for portability, large parts are tool-generated). 
<BR>
However, there are problems when I combine it with assembler code: 
<BR>
a combination that works on Tru64 fails on Linux. 
<BR>
<P>I have not yet done a complete analysis, but my first suspicion is 
<BR>
that Compaq C (at least on Tru64) might generate structure layouts 
<BR>
which differ from gcc's (even though both are on/for Alpha hardware). 
<BR>
<P>If that should prove true, I fear your idea is hard to realize 
<BR>
because it might require an all-or-nothing decision. 
<BR>
<P>A &quot;compatibility check&quot; of these compilers might help: 
<BR>
- size and alignment of types 
<BR>
- structure layouts, padding etc. 
<BR>
- function calling and parameter passing conventions 
<BR>
- C++ : name mangling 
<BR>
- ... 
<BR>
Is there any source for that kind of info ?
