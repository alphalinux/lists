<EM>&gt; I am not sure whether you have your Alpha with SuSE-6.3 installed.

<EM>&gt; You seem to have no problem with your gs.  From the responses

<P>I just re-intalled SuSE in my machine. It doesn't work. I get this:

<BR>
<P>I get the same error from the binaries installed from the CD and from
<BR>
newly compiled binaries from the Intel SuSE 6.4 source RPMs (just plain
<BR>
'rpm -bb gs_lib.spec').
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I received from the mailing list, it is apparent the SuSE-6.3 for Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has a terrible problem with Ghostview/Ghostscript.  Still no good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solution.   Yet, not many do seem to care about this.  Why is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so?  With all the nice features of SuSE-6.3 compared to RedHat-6.1,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SuSE has this basic trouble.  No matter what people say, there are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more RedHat-for-Alpha distributions than the SuSE-for-Alpha one.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't keep messages for too long, since I only have 10 mb of mailbox
<BR>
disk space. Please post the kind of hardware you have and what error messages
<BR>
you get when running ghostscript (don't bother with ghostview or gv for now,
<BR>
since they are just GUI skins for gs.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I am still holding onto SuSE because of yast and nisplus.  But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that does not really give me a good excuse for all other troubles.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm also having troubles with SuSE 6.3 and this machine, an Alpha Station
<BR>
400 4/233. The X server from the CDs crashes when I try to use KDE. I 
<BR>
have to recompile it in order for it to work. There were
<BR>
other problems with the QT libraries, but no updates have been posted
<BR>
in the SuSE ftp site so far. Hopefully they'll address all these
<BR>
problems in 6.4. By the way, when is it coming out?
<BR>
<P>I consider SuSE's distribution superior to RedHat's, so a little patience
<BR>
from your part and some help from this list would be greatly appreciated.
<BR>
