<P>I am not sure whether you have your Alpha with SuSE-6.3 installed.
<BR>
You seem to have no problem with your gs.  From the responses
<BR>
I received from the mailing list, it is apparent the SuSE-6.3 for Alpha
<BR>
has a terrible problem with Ghostview/Ghostscript.  Still no good 
<BR>
solution.   Yet, not many do seem to care about this.  Why is that 
<BR>
so?  With all the nice features of SuSE-6.3 compared to RedHat-6.1, 
<BR>
SuSE has this basic trouble.  No matter what people say, there are
<BR>
more RedHat-for-Alpha distributions than the SuSE-for-Alpha one.
<BR>
<P>This fact makes me quite frustrated.  Not many update rpm packages
<BR>
in the ftp.suse.com, either, compared to the updates for RedHat for
<BR>
Alpha.  My favorite window manager is AfterStep.  Its version in the 
<BR>
SuSE distribution is way behind that for RedHat, etc.  What about 
<BR>
libjpeg?  Even with all the help from this mailing list, I failed to
<BR>
install SuSE-6.3 on a UP2000 by ftp.  When I try to buy a CDROM, 
<BR>
SuSE told me to contact the Korean distribution.  Well, the Korean 
<BR>
distributor has never imported a copy of SUSE for Alpha.  They 
<BR>
promised to import 6.4 when it comes.  So, I have one Alpha with 
<BR>
RedHat and another with SuSE-6.3.  What a nonsense!
<BR>
<P>I am still holding onto SuSE because of yast and nisplus.  But 
<BR>
that does not really give me a good excuse for all other troubles.
<BR>

<BR>
