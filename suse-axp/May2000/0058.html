Hi ! 
<BR>
<P>My problem is solved, read on if you like explanations and hints ...

<EM>&gt; &gt; Hi to all !
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I just was caught by big surprise:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; In a directory containing files with small and CAPITAL letters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (for example, random order:   &quot;ABC&quot;  &quot;CEF&quot;  &quot;ade&quot;  &quot;ccc&quot; ),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the bash expands some patterns from small to capital letters:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     [abc]*  -&gt;  ade ccc
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     [a-c]*  -&gt;  ABC ade ccc CEF
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; IMHO, the latter expansion is wrong because the character range
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; from &quot;a&quot; to &quot;c&quot; (small) does not include &quot;A&quot; or &quot;C&quot; (capital).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this is usually caused by &quot;LC_COLLATE&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Try to check your /etc/profile , .bashrc , ... for setting of $LANG
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (my .bashrc always has a &quot;unset LANG&quot; , but something like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;export LC_COLLATE=POSIX&quot; should work as well). 
</EM><BR>
<P>I checked the environment: 
<BR>
- LANG was set to &quot;german&quot;, completely unsetting it did not help, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;neither did setting &quot;LC_COLLATE=POSIX&quot;. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(see note below) 
<BR>
- Setting LANG to &quot;C&quot; and starting a sub-bash did not improve either, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;on checking I found that LANG was &quot;german&quot; again ! 
<BR>
<P>I then checked the startup files and found that '~/.bashrc' reads 
<BR>
'/etc/profile' unless it finds a variable &quot;PROFILEREAD&quot; set 
<BR>
(which happens in '/etc/profile'). 
<BR>
The problem is that this variable, even if set, is _not_ exported, 
<BR>
so it does not propagate to sub-shells. When these start, they 
<BR>
again read '/etc/profile', and LANG is set back to &quot;german&quot; - what 
<BR>
happened to me. 
<BR>
<P>First circumvention: Setting LANG to &quot;C&quot; and starting a sub-bash 
<BR>
with '--norc' had the character class '[a-c]' behave correctly, 
<BR>
no capital characters matched. 
<BR>
<P>Correction: I added &quot;export PROFILEREAD&quot; to my '.bashrc' 
<BR>
after the sourcing of '/etc/profile'. 
<BR>
Now a sub-bash inherited LANG with the value &quot;C&quot; and worked. 
<BR>
<P>I suggest this should be propagated to the master versions, 
<BR>
for without this there is no chance of ever overriding any setting 
<BR>
of '/etc/profile' for any interactive sub-bash. 
<BR>
<P>Ruediger, you seem to work for SuSE - will you forward this, or 
<BR>
should I send an own bug report for '.bashrc' ? 
<BR>
<P><P>Note: I did not do a thorough test, but I checked in a bash 
<BR>
started with &quot;LANG=C&quot;: Even when changing LANG back to &quot;german&quot;, 
<BR>
the character class expanded correctly. So I suspect that these 
<BR>
variables are only evaluated at shell start, not for each expansion. 
<BR>
<P>In a sub-bash started with &quot;LANG=german&quot; and &quot;LC_COLLATE=POSIX&quot;, 
<BR>
it also worked. 
<BR>
<P>I would prefer this combination, but 
<BR>
setting and exporting &quot;LC_COLLATE=POSIX&quot; in '~/.bashrc' is not 
<BR>
sufficient, it seems to be too late (needed at startup). 
<BR>
If anybody has an idea where to put this setting so that it 
<BR>
has effect, I would appreciate a note. 
<BR>
