Well for starters why don't you go to
<BR>
<A HREF="http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/">http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/</A>
<BR>
<P>and get the new firmware?
<BR>
<P>Secondly I have found that fdisk works just fine on large drives.
<BR>
I usually use the bsd labels though.
<BR>
Most often it doesn't know how to deal with all the cylinders and sectors so
<BR>
you just have to wing it.
<BR>
Meaning that you start &quot;a&quot; at 2 and go to , say, 45.
<BR>
Then make &quot;b&quot; start at 46 and go to, say, 110
<BR>
<P>etc........
<BR>
<P>It takes a few trys to get it right but it does work.

<P><P>Hi list,
<BR>
<P>I just finished upgrading my alphastation 250 4/266 by outfitting it
<BR>
with a new 18.3 GB SCSI HD from Western Digital. This is in addition to
<BR>
the old 1GB Quantum HD that the machine came with. Since the WD drive
<BR>
is an Ultra SCSI-2 I also installed a new SYM8952U PCI-SCSI card. The
<BR>
Quantum drive obviously had to remain on the on-board SCSI controller.
<BR>
After boot-up everything worked well, i.e., the system (currently
<BR>
running SuSE-AXP 6.1 and eagerly awaiting 6.3) recognized the new HD as
<BR>
/dev/sdb and I was able to partition it with YaST. However, a major
<BR>
drawback is that fdisk doesn't seem to recognize the full 18.3 GB and
<BR>
stops at about 16.3 GB. My hunch is that the BIOS of the motherboard
<BR>
will not allow larger disk sizes to be recognized. This has to be a
<BR>
card made in 1994 or 1995 when large disks like this for desktops
<BR>
weren't around. So, here are my questions for the experts:
<BR>
<P>1. Is the BIOS to be blamed or is there something that can be done with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fdisk to remedy the situation and allow full access to the 18.3 GB? 
<BR>
2. If my diagnosis is correct and the BIOS is too old, is there an easy
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way to update it for the AS 250 4/266? And if that is so, can you
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give me pointers to such an upgrade?
<BR>
<P>Thank you very much in advance, Alex.
<BR>
