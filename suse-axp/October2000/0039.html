<EM>&gt; configuration by hand, and look up the ip-address of ftp.suse.com
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beforehand, though.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, I admit it is nice to be able to install by FTP. But my
<BR>
Linux-box is not connected to the internet. (The only possibility would
<BR>
be by modem upto 28800 bauds) So ftp is not so usefull for me. (Given,
<BR>
that it is almost cheaper to buy the distribution than to download it at
<BR>
that speed. And my point is more about beeing able to test whether it
<BR>
actually works on my machine. I bought 6.1/6.3 and 6.4 and to be honest
<BR>
all three worked to some degree. But none of those three is worth the
<BR>
money, judged from what I know now.)

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Whether this is better or worse than an ISO image is, of course, a matter of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; opinion. You'll propably end up downloading a lot less than a full ISO
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; image, but on the hand if you need to do it more than once you might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eventually have downloaded more, and the full contents of the 7.0
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distribution covers 6 CDs...
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One evaluation image (containing the basic system) would be
<BR>
sufficient to test it. (Wer will schon die Katze im Sack kaufen) Why are
<BR>
they able to supply evaluation images for i386, full images for S390, ia64
<BR>
and sparc, only ppc and axp are neglected. I do not consider this good
<BR>
business acumen. Speaking of business acumen, having someone rant on in
<BR>
ones mailing-list without defdending oneself is very liberal but also not
<BR>
very professional.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is of course the ONLY way to go if you don't have a CD burner handy.
