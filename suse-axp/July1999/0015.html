Hi,
<BR>
<P>we are using a Sable system (Digital Alpha Server 2100 4/275, 2 CPUs) under
<BR>
Redhat since January 1998. With single CPU kernels it runs very well, but until
<BR>
kernel 2.2.6 there was no stable SMP kernel available.
<BR>
It now runs 2.2.6 SMP without any problems, our actual uptime is 85 days.
<BR>
<P>I've tried to install SuSE 6.1 beta on it, but there was a memory error very
<BR>
early during the installation. The 6.1 final has arrived here yesterday, so
<BR>
I'll try to install it soon. Mainly because it's our favourite Linux
<BR>
distribution here, we are running about 80 Intel based systems with SuSE.
<BR>
<P>I'm also running 6.1 beta on a miata (Personal Workstation 433au) since march
<BR>
and was surprised by the completeness of this distribution.
<BR>
The main problem with Alpha AXP Linux is booting under SRM, a simple
<BR>
boot dva0 does't work on our computers. I have had to supply parameters:
<BR>
boot dva0 -file vmlinux.gz -flags &quot;root=/dev/fd0 prompt_ramdisk=1
<BR>
load_ramdisk=1&quot;
<BR>
boot dva0 0 doen't work ether, in conflict with the manual.
<BR>
The kernel on aboot doesn't work on our miata, I have had success later with a
<BR>
special 2.2.3 kernel, which I made on our Sable.
<BR>
The manual is sadly no help with this problems, but why we have internet?
<BR>
<P>But: If you managed the boot problems finally, the rest is very nice.
<BR>
<P>Andreas
