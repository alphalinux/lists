<P>Hi,
<BR>
<P>today I installed SuSE 6.1 on a AS 800 (5/500) and ran into several Problems. I really hope that
<BR>
somebody here can help me:
<BR>
<P>(I installed using &quot;aboot&quot;, since there is no MILO-Image for the AS 800)
<BR>
<P>- - From time to time (today twice) the machine dies completely. One time it happened after I
<BR>
opened &quot;fdisk /dev/sdb&quot;, selected b and had it print the disklabels. Suddenly no
<BR>
Keyboard-Entry was possible, a PING from another machine didn't get any  response from the
<BR>
server and so on - I had to reset.
<BR>
<P>- - I wanted to compile an optimum Kernel for this machine. I selected &quot;Noritake&quot; as the type and
<BR>
configured everything not to use Modules, then, after re-checking the config, performed a
<BR>
make dep ; make clean ; make boot (btw: one time the machine hang completely (see above)
<BR>
during the &quot;make boot&quot; part). After that I moved the &quot;vmlinux.gz&quot; from the .../arch/... Directory to
<BR>
the /boot. Then restarted with &quot;boot dka0 -fi /boot/vmlinux.gz -fl root=/dev/sda1&quot;. Then I get the
<BR>
usual aboot-Messages, then &quot;Loading compressed Image&quot;, &quot;OK, now booting the Kernel&quot; -
<BR>
then the screen flashed for short (got a short black-flash, then immediately got blue again) and
<BR>
I got a &quot;Halted CPU 0 / halt code = 5 / HALT instrauction executed / PC=fffffc0000310088&quot;. When
<BR>
I instead boot with the -fi /boot/vmlinuz (to boot the standard-kernel that came with SuSE 6.1)
<BR>
the machine boots 1a (btw: I use the beta-qlogicisp Driver, as the Mainboard uses a Qlogic ISP
<BR>
1020a Controller).
<BR>
<P>- - During boot I get a &quot;Hard Link failed, Symbolic Link used instead&quot; when it tries to set the
<BR>
timezone using tiz in &quot;sbin/init.d/boot&quot;. When I try to run &quot;tiz&quot; manually (using the
<BR>
&quot;Europe/Berlin&quot; Timezone) I get the same message!
<BR>
<P>- - I cannot make the machine use Software RAID-0!
<BR>
I set up three Disklabels, each of the same size, on thee disks. These are the &quot;h&quot; Disklabel on
<BR>
/dev/sda and the &quot;a&quot; Disklabel on /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc (unfortunately only one controller).
<BR>
Reboot. Then I performed a &quot;mdadd /dev/md0 /dev/sda8 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1&quot;, then a &quot;mdrun
<BR>
- -p0 /dev/md0&quot;, then &quot;mkfs -t ext2 /dev/md0&quot;, then mounted the partition, the umounted again,
<BR>
&quot;mdstop /dev/md0&quot; and then rebooted. Then tried to &quot;mdadd ...&quot; again, but got an error for
<BR>
/dev/sdb1 and /dev/sdc1. Tried several times, then went into &quot;fdisk&quot;, selected &quot;b&quot; -- and got a
<BR>
message, that there were *no* disklabels on /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc. It seems, the RAID-0 -Set
<BR>
mysteriously erases the Disklables off the two disks (but not off the /dev/sda)!
<BR>
<P>I just realized that I started the &quot;a&quot;-Disklabels on /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc @ Cyl. 1 (length of 290
<BR>
Cyls) - while I started at some bigger Cylinder @ /dev/sda! May this cause the problem (may I
<BR>
not start a used disklabel @ Cyl. 1 but at some bigger Cyl.? (I do have a &quot;c&quot; Label on all Drives
<BR>
that spans the whole drive!))??
<BR>
<P>Would really be great if somebody could help me with one or the other of the Problems I have!
<BR>
<P>Thanx in advance,
<BR>
