<P>
In the 7.0 dist there was no support for tga2 video cards in X. I had to
<BR>
go and get the
<BR>
sources for X (4.0.1?) and add a patch for the tga2. The installation
<BR>
support people tried
<BR>
to help me get X going before all that but failed. Once I found the
<BR>
patch and got it to
<BR>
work I informed the SuSE people that there was a patch available and
<BR>
where it was and all
<BR>
that. They said they were intrested so I gave them all the info I could.
<BR>
My question is did they include it in the 7.1 release or am I going to
<BR>
have to go and build X from sources/patches again if I buy 7.1 for
<BR>
alpha???
