Hi again,
<BR>
<P>sorry for my fault, I know there was a reply but somehow I
<BR>
managed to delete the mail before reading (elm in ssh over
<BR>
an overloaded cable modem...). :-(
<BR>
<P>I finally have the machine installed, using the initrd image unpacked
<BR>
to a spare scsi disk. I still use the old milo image for booting, which
<BR>
seems not to be a problem when doing a standard boot without initrd.
<BR>
<P>I still have one problem:
<BR>
sometimes, rpm uses all memory available when installing any package,
<BR>
gets killed by the kernel when there is not any more VM available, and
<BR>
on the next try works flawlessly (as far as I can see).
<BR>
This happened about four or five times during the installation (not
<BR>
too many packages selected).
<BR>
Is this a (known) bug (I did not find anything about this yet), or
<BR>
could this be related to scsi problems? There are definitely some
<BR>
weird issues with the special scsi cable of the internal bus, as
<BR>
soon as I connect other devices to it, they do not work (most times
<BR>
not even recognized, only scsi timeouts), only the disk at the first
<BR>
connector seems to work without problems. I could not change the
<BR>
cable yet, as I do not have a wide terminator, which is soldered to
<BR>
the original cable...
<BR>
However, when these rpm issues occur, there are no log messages
<BR>
besides the notice about rpm being killed, so I suspect this is
<BR>
not related.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
Wolfgang
