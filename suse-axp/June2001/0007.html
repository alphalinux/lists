<P>
Please excuse if I am mistaken, but I think you can have both DOS and
<BR>
disklabel partition tables at the same time. Just make sure they match!
<BR>
<P>My gut feeling is that this ought to be impossible; isn't both kind of 
<BR>
tables stored in the same place? But I believe I had such a setup up
<BR>
and running once. I created both DOS and disklabel partitions from the
<BR>
shell.
<BR>
<P>(I have an AS200 which currently runs SuSE 6.4, NT and W2k. I thus boot
<BR>
it from ARC, but I have experimented with booting Linux from either SRM
<BR>
or ARC when I also had VMS on it. It was easier to switch O/S:s when I
<BR>
didn't have to also switch console. But I no longer have that setup
<BR>
active, so I can't check.)

<EM>&gt; Have you tried getting it to boot from the SRM console?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes I have. The only problem is that SRM needs disklabel partitioning, which
<BR>
<P>appears to be incompatible with LVM. I found this out the hard way. If there
<BR>
<P>is a way to get it to boot off of a DOS partirioned drive, I'd be happy. Or 
<BR>
if there's a way to only use disklabel on the drive containing the root 
<BR>
filesystem, allowing the kernel to pick up the LVM stuff after it has
<BR>
loaded. 
<BR>
That would work as all the drives are picked up in SRM and there is no crash
<BR>
<P>on loading the kernel.
<BR>
<P>With the hard drives as they are (4 2G, 3 1G) it's kind of useless to keep 
<BR>
them split up. I plan on using the box for storage and backup (it has a tape
<BR>
<P>drive).
