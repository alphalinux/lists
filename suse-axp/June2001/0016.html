Geocrawler isn't up now, so I can't check that link. (It has said
<BR>
something about &quot;nightly maintenance&quot; and &quot;check back in 10-15
<BR>
minutes&quot; the whole day now...)
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I suppose you've found something about swriteboot. You
<BR>
abosolutely must let swriteboot write the &quot;boot block&quot; on the drive
<BR>
you intend to let SRM boot from. But, as you concluded, you must
<BR>
reserve space for the boot block by leaving the first cylinder
<BR>
unpartitioned. swriteboot does not wipe the partition table.
<BR>
<P>You can definitely have just one drive disklabel partitioned and the
<BR>
others DOS partitioned. (If you don't manage to use both
<BR>
simultaneously on one drive.)
<BR>
<P>yast has always had problems mixing DOS and disklabel partitions
<BR>
(but the problems are less now), you should probably play safe by
<BR>
setting up the partitions manually.

<EM>&gt; Please excuse if I am mistaken, but I think you can have both DOS and

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My gut feeling is that this ought to be impossible; isn't both kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tables stored in the same place? But I believe I had such a setup up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and running once. I created both DOS and disklabel partitions from the

<EM>&gt; (I have an AS200 which currently runs SuSE 6.4, NT and W2k. I thus boot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it from ARC, but I have experimented with booting Linux from either SRM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or ARC when I also had VMS on it. It was easier to switch O/S:s when I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; didn't have to also switch console. But I no longer have that setup
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; active, so I can't check.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok, I managed to boot in a haphazard way with SRM (dka600 is my CDROM):
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; boot dka600 -fl i
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<EM>aboot&gt; b 1/vmlinux.gz root=/dev/sda2
</EM><BR>
<P>This worked, but I compiled my own kernel so the one on the CD is not the
<BR>
one 
<BR>
I want (my network doesn't come up) and SRM seems to only be able to boot a 
<BR>
kernel from the disk it resides on.
<BR>
<P>I did find this interesting post: 
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.geocrawler.com/archives/3/86/2000/2/0/3372007/">http://www.geocrawler.com/archives/3/86/2000/2/0/3372007/</A>
<BR>
<P>Would this be ok? I can easily repartition /dev/sda1 to start at cylinder 2.
<BR>
<P>I'm just worried that swriteboot might wipe my partition table entirely. I
<BR>
am 
<BR>
a complete newbie to disklabels, SRM, etc.
<BR>
<P>If that doesn't work, would I be able to simply wipe /dev/sda and recreate
<BR>
it 
<BR>
using BSD disklabels, while keeping the other drives DOS-partitioned? I
<BR>
tried 
<BR>
installing 7.1 using aboot before, but LVM didn't work during the install. 
<BR>
YaST put disklabels on all of my drives...
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
