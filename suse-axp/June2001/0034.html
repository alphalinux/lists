<EM>&gt; Compaq says it will deliver EV7 on VMS and Tru64, but will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; immediately start porting *all* its platforms to IA-64.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; At least this explains why SuSE said they would not port 7.2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to Alpha...
</EM><BR>
<P>All this just after those recent press releases. Intel must have made *quite* 
<BR>
an offer.
<BR>
<P>I have to say that this is disappointing to say the least...
<BR>
<P>I only just got my first Alpha, too. SuSE 7.1 runs great on it.
