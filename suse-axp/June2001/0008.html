Hi!
<BR>
<P>I had great trouble to get X running with SuSE 7.0 and compiled XFree myself which
<BR>
messed around a lot inside the X dirs, but finally resulted in a working XFree 4.0.2.
<BR>
<P>To clean up, i did a complete new install of 7.1 on my Ruffian system.
<BR>
Worked fine, but X didn't work either (ATI Xpert@work card).
<BR>
3.3.6 says: None of the configured devices could be found or anything like that.
<BR>
IIRC, recently there was a thread of someone else, who has the exact same problem.
<BR>
<P>sax2 doesn't like my PS/2 mouse (couldn't get it to a functional state).
<BR>
So i made my own XF86Config for XFree 4.0.?. and
<BR>
that worked o.k. (sax2 deactivates the mouse immediately on startup, while it
<BR>
works in X - strange...)
<BR>
<P>But my real problem is with ISDN.
<BR>
While updating anyway i switched from kernel 2.2.19 to 2.4.4-suse.
<BR>
I entered the Nameserver of my ISP (T-online) and if i do a
<BR>
ping www.t-online.de it lasts a while, the connection comes up
<BR>
and then it says www.t-online.de host name not found (or anything like that).
<BR>
If i immediately restart the same command, it works like a charm.
<BR>
This problem is with any machine on the internet.
<BR>
In SuSE 7.0 and kernel 2.2.19 it worked o.k.
<BR>
<P>Of course i activated the dynamic-ip patch in the rc.config file.
<BR>
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_dynaddr returns 7.
<BR>
<P>Any ideas?
<BR>
<P>Thanks in advance,
<BR>
Martin.
<BR>
