<P>
I have been trying to build a kernel using an updated version of ip_fw.c
<BR>
which is in the /usr/src/linux/net/ipv4/ tree.
<BR>
<P>The latest versions of this module have two important patches which the
<BR>
version distirbuted with Suse 6.1 for Alpha do not have.
<BR>
<P>I have two problems:
<BR>
<P>1. Building the kernel in Suse seems to be quite different from other
<BR>
linux-es, as the kernel How-to doesn't match what the Makefile does.
<BR>
<P>Since I can't find any documentation about hos to build a kernel on
<BR>
Suse,I'm at a loss other than to try things, none of which work. 
<BR>
<P>2. I have found the module I need with patches already in it.  That is to
<BR>
say that the module from a 2.2.12 kernel ftp-ed from ftp.digital.com is
<BR>
correct.
<BR>
<P>How do I use this?  
<BR>
<P>If I take just the ip_fw.c code, the kernel build blows up as the rest of
<BR>
the kernel source is the 2.2.9 which came on my CDs.
<BR>
<P>So, in summary, is there a kernel Howto for Suse AXP?
<BR>
<P>And, can I build a kernel using a 2.2.12 source tree downloaded from
<BR>
ftp.digital.com/linux/kernels, and replacing the source tree at
<BR>
/usr/src/linux??
<BR>
<P><P>Thanks and regards,
<BR>
