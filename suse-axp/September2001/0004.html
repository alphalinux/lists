No, Suse AXP support hasn't stopped. But as Steve said, it is behind the x86
<BR>
platform.  Suse AXP 7.1 was actually just released a couple months ago.  And
<BR>
since Suse is actively selling and supporting the AXP platform, I think that
<BR>
pretty well answers your question.  But it makes since that since there are
<BR>
thousands more x86 chips out there than alphas, that the development would be
<BR>
for x86 first, and ppc/alpha/etc... would come second.
<BR>
<P>Compaq seems to be doing a wonderful job at supporting linux on alpha.  You can
<BR>
download from Compaq and RedHat a bootable ISO called &quot;Jump Start&quot; that will
<BR>
prep/partition your alpha workstation/server to prepare it for installing
<BR>
RedHat, Suse, Debian, TurboLinux, etc...  Also, Compaq just mailed me the latest
<BR>
5.1A version of True64 and it came with 2 sets of Linux portability tools.  It
<BR>
included tons of GNU software and it even came with KDE2, Gnome, and
<BR>
instructions for converting True64 to use RPM package manager.
<BR>
<P>Very optimistic...

<EM>&gt; &gt; As I see from the Suse Website the current version for AXP is 7.1.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Has development of the AXP distribution been stopped ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not sure about that, but SuSE announced that it will try to release all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dists for all plattforms at the same time. The question is, whether they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; managed to do so or not. We (the Alpha people) might have to wait a bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; longer than the others (although the PPC people are also suffering).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If so, can you still recommend Suse Linux on Alphas,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or should I consider switching to something else?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm using AlphaLinux on my XP1000 quite a while and works well, not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perfectly, though. I experienced some problems with newer kernel versions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (&gt;2.2.19) and stability under KDE2. Seems to be an Alpha-specific problem,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the SPARCs around here are doing a great job. I recommend using gnome and/or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Enlightenment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Another point is, that you are bound to Compaqs future development efforts if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you're programming Java or Fortran. The offer great support, but their latest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SDKs still have some weaknesses. C/C++ proramming is fun, they have nice free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; binary tools and optimizers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Neertheless, I'm very satisfied. SuSE produced a well working distribution
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is worth buying (and it's quite cheap: approx. Euro 50,-, Red Hats
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AlphaLinux costs about Euro 150-200,-).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bye,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Steve.
