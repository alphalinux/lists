Yes, this happens to me on an irregular and frustratingly unpredictable 
<BR>
basis, not only on the Alpha (LX164, SuSE 7.1) but also on two Pentiums (SuSE 
<BR>
7.2 on both). The keyboard and mouse seem to lock, and the only recourse is 
<BR>
the off switch. I don't like doing this, but nothing else has worked, not 
<BR>
even the suggestion of using the alt-sysreq-s and so forth.
<BR>
It seems to be worse with any screensaver, so I no longer use a screensaver 
<BR>
on any of the machines. A Pain. Did an upgrade on the Alpha to xf86 4.1, no 
<BR>
better, and the fonts were a mess. No time to figure it out, back to the xf86 
<BR>
4.0.
<BR>
Posted a while back to this list, no response then.

<EM>&gt; Hi there,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without going into details, yes, sometimes X freezes on my AS 1000 5/300
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as well. Most of the time magic system request still works: alt-sysreq-s
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to sync the disks, alt-sysreq-u to unmount the filesystem, alt-sysreq-b to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reboot (with some seconds of pause inbetween the commands).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even though this is no real solution it might safe you from filesystem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corruption, but you will end rebooting the machie anyhow. It might be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good idea to switch ti X4.1 as some alpha related fixes were reported to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be included there. BTW even though this is the SuSE AXP List, of all alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lists it has to lowest activity. Therefore it might be a good idea to cc
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such requests as well on the redhat or debian alpha lists.

<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm running 7.0 with KDE.  For the third time in three months, the

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; no response from the keyboard or mouse - I can't log in as root OR shut
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; down.  Also, as the computer is locked up I cannot determine what version
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of Xfree/KDE I am running.  They're the versions that came with the SuSE

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Right now, I'd simply like to stop the X Server and get back to the

<EM>&gt; &gt; terminal without cold-rebooting (I cold-rebooted the last two times and

<EM>&gt; &gt; ran the risk but don't want to do it again).  Ctrl-Alt-Backspace does not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; work (should it?)

<EM>&gt; &gt; This happens about once a month to me.  Has anyone else run into this
