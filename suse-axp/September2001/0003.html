<EM>&gt; Hello list,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've got a problem that may not be Alpha-related: Every now and then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've got a job that cannot be killed.This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happened with a simple shell script, Netscape, as well as a Fortran
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; program written by myself. These jobs do show up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as running jobs, not zombies; they resist any 'kill' command including
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'kill -9' done as root. So far that has only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; occured on an Alpha workstation (UP2000, Suse 6.4) , never on i386. Is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there anything besides rebooting that could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be done?
</EM><BR>
<P>You need to do some reading for the details, the general line is this: 
<BR>
<P>1) A process reacts to a signal (including SIGKILL == 9) at the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moment it is _delivered_ to the recipient (not when it is sent). 
<BR>
2) A signal is delivered when the process returns from system. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In details, this might be (AFAIR): 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- It has finished executing a system call, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- it begins a new time slice (returns from being paused), 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- or it was executing a system call which might include waiting 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(= read from terminal, from network; &quot;pause&quot;; ...), 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;got the system call in such a waiting period, and now returns.
<BR>
<P>Now the crux is that there are system calls which are assumed 
<BR>
never to take long, so their waiting period (in the Unix kernel) 
<BR>
is not programmed to check for signals, but in fact can take 
<BR>
very long (= &quot;infinite&quot; waiting) in some rare circumstances.
<BR>
<P>This is called something like &quot;uninterruptible sleep&quot;, and the 
<BR>
process would have to finish this system call (which it will never 
<BR>
do, given these exceptional error conditions) to get the signal.
<BR>
<P>You should use some 'ps' option ('-l' or '-f', AFAIR) to get the 
<BR>
process state displayed.
<BR>
<P>If a process is in such a state, AFAIK only rebooting will help.
<BR>
