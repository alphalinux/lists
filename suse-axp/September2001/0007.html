I don't know about my Alpha, 'cause I'm not running X on it, but I'm running
<BR>
SuSE 7.1 on a Athlon 500 system and I've experienced this lockup-problem 5
<BR>
times now, 3 of which in the last 2 weeks. Only the last time it was while I
<BR>
was working: XMMS just stopped and there was nothing I could do anymore, not
<BR>
even log from a remote. I had just coded about 500 lines which were lost
<BR>
(haven't had that since I threw out Windows 2 years ago :-()
<BR>
<P>All the other Times the x-server had locked up the computer during a
<BR>
screensaver, so I already had switched of the screensaver, but that's not it!
<BR>
<P>Every time it happened I upgraded something, but I still haven't figured out
<BR>
where the problem is. Currently I'm running Suse 7.1, Kernel 2.2.19, XFree86
<BR>
4.1.0, KDE 2.2.1.
<BR>
<P>Another system I have, A Pentium II 350, only locks up in the X login screen
<BR>
after boot sometimes, but on this one it's still possible to login remotely and
<BR>
restarting the x-server solves the problem, although it's not possible to
<BR>
restart the x-server by mouse or keyboard.
<BR>
<P>I've tried various powersave settings for the monitor, but nothing seems to
<BR>
solve the problem, can't find any errormessages or stackdumps either. Does
<BR>
anyone know what's going on here? I rather paranoidly saving my stuff every 5
<BR>
minutes now and that brings back bad memories.....

<P><EM>&gt; Yes, this happens to me on an irregular and frustratingly unpredictable 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  basis, not only on the Alpha (LX164, SuSE 7.1) but also on two Pentiums (SuSE 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  7.2 on both). The keyboard and mouse seem to lock, and the only recourse is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the off switch. I don't like doing this, but nothing else has worked, not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  even the suggestion of using the alt-sysreq-s and so forth.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  It seems to be worse with any screensaver, so I no longer use a screensaver 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  on any of the machines. A Pain. Did an upgrade on the Alpha to xf86 4.1, no 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  better, and the fonts were a mess. No time to figure it out, back to the xf86 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  4.0.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Posted a while back to this list, no response then.

<EM>&gt;  &gt; Hi there,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; without going into details, yes, sometimes X freezes on my AS 1000 5/300
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; as well. Most of the time magic system request still works: alt-sysreq-s
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; to sync the disks, alt-sysreq-u to unmount the filesystem, alt-sysreq-b to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; reboot (with some seconds of pause inbetween the commands).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Even though this is no real solution it might safe you from filesystem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; corruption, but you will end rebooting the machie anyhow. It might be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; good idea to switch ti X4.1 as some alpha related fixes were reported to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; be included there. BTW even though this is the SuSE AXP List, of all alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; lists it has to lowest activity. Therefore it might be a good idea to cc
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; such requests as well on the redhat or debian alpha lists.

<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt; Right now, I'd simply like to stop the X Server and get back to the
