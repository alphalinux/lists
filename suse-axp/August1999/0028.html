Hi Michael,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That system will run any video card. The issue is Linux. You can use the tga
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; card but you will not get X windows.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would suggest going to the local discount store and getting a $60 matrox
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; millenium.
</EM><BR>
<P>I am joining the list just since two days. Had to add this list, was joining
<BR>
Alphant-list before. It압 just very funny to meet somebody from Compaq in this
<BR>
list too. Almost unavoidable these days regarding Alpha-technology.
<BR>
<P>Your tip reminds me of these f......common problems on AlphaNT. NT4 for
<BR>
IT-evolution is a rotten old thing. And the only supported hardware is simply
<BR>
not available anymore. I can앖 get hold of a matrox millenium in any shop in
<BR>
Germany. It압 very nice to know this and that component is/was supported, but
<BR>
it압 just a pain in the a... having to look for USED OLD COMPONENTS to get your
<BR>
high-end-system to run.
<BR>
<P>I noticed this was a question regarding quite an old alpha-system too. I am
<BR>
writing this mail because of the end of AlphaNT, where we had a very difficult
<BR>
situation for hardware-support because of our special position. Sitting on NT4
<BR>
and the only drivers available for NT Alpha were the ones shipped with the first
<BR>
release of NT4. Because of this during 1999 the AlphaNT-users were desperately
<BR>
waiting for Win2k for Alpha. With a few thousand uptodate peripheral components
<BR>
supported.
<BR>
<P>And Compaq just figured there is less and less sales in NT Alpha, so let압 drop
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P>Please don앖 take this as a personal attack, I don앖 know you, I don앖 want to
<BR>
critisize you for anything you do or did. Still having to digest the news
<BR>
regarding alpha since 23.August. And as all the alpha-nt-users am very
<BR>
disappointed about Compaq압 marketing strategy for Alpha and this very sudden
<BR>
important change that Compaq did, communicating exactly the opposit for more
<BR>
than six month before. Until today I had some hope that there압 a chance for
<BR>
API/Samsung to fully takeover and care for Alpha including NT-development FOR
<BR>
Alpha. Instead Compaq ensures it압 further support for 64bit NT, and it압
<BR>
successful satisfying partnership with M$, offering the only available 64bit
<BR>
hardware for development, to somewhen release and offer Intel 64bit systems and
<BR>
NT. But only for Intel 64bit, NOT for Alpha. It압 the WINTEL-gang making the
<BR>
race, even though Compaq did have the best challenger for Intel in their hands.
<BR>
As somebody in the alphant-list stated, this is like somebody unable to sell
<BR>
ice-cream at the beach, even though he압 at the beach with a big box of
<BR>
ice-cream, and the only one offering ice-cream.
<BR>
<P>Ok, I앏l stop now. I am working as a sales-engineer for alpha-technology in
<BR>
Hamburg, germany. And unfortunetely my company concentrates on
<BR>
high-end-graphics. This market-segment is dominated by NT-applications like
<BR>
Lightwave, SoftImage 3D, Digital Fusion etc.
<BR>
<P>But for any further use of my private Alpha164-633, I앏l join the
<BR>
suse-linux-camp now.
<BR>
<P>And I am very optimistic knowing Linux is not depending on any missing competent
<BR>
CEO.
<BR>
<P>Dietmar, frustrated on a friday-evening, when API after seven days of desperate
<BR>
waiting finally just announced: yes, NT is not available for Alpha anymore.
<BR>
Windows is Intel only, and we앏l head for Linux. Again, I am happy switching to
<BR>
Linux, I know almost every platform is supported, and this project is not in the
<BR>
hands of stupid managers, marketeers and beancounters. It압 the project of
<BR>
enthusiastic IT-professionals, willing to share their knowledge.
<BR>
<P>I am willing to contribute my little share. Wrote an installation-howto for
<BR>
SuSE-AXP, specially for people switching from Wintel-systems. Knowing SuSE for
<BR>
Intel since 5.0, noticed that this special install-howto in the huge manual
<BR>
still lacks.
<BR>
<P>Could post it as an html-file. Or what압 this lists policy ? SuSE Team ? please
<BR>
help
<BR>
<P>Again, Michael, this is not a personal attack. Yours was just the first mailing
<BR>
coming from Compaq.com I saw.
