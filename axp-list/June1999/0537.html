<P>
<EM>&gt; I was encouraged by the Red Hat offer of installation assistance (telephone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &amp; email) to give it a try  on an alpha I acquired for this purpose.
</EM><BR>
<P>Honestly, I've never had &quot;installation support&quot; for *any* piece of
<BR>
software be worth a damn.  But still, Redhat should strive to be
<BR>
better than average, especially since they raised the price of the
<BR>
product with this support as a reason.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; the solution to (1) involved using mkfs.msdos to format the partition and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; copying the required files there. Hardly an Alpha-specific problem.
</EM><BR>
<P>During the *installation*, that is a fairly Alpha-specific problem.
<BR>
Neither Sparc nor x86 installs require the creation of a formatted
<BR>
MSDOS partition to install.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; the solution to (3) only required locating the appropirate kernel file
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (*z.n.n.n) in the /boot directory and telling MILO to use it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Get used to this if you plan on trying different kernel builds.  It's
<BR>
always nice to have another boot selection that falls back on a kernel
<BR>
that you know works.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; (2) would have not been an issue were it not for my efforts at resolving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (1). It would have been nice for someone to formally record the doc error
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the benefit of others whether or not they knew anything of the Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; platform.
</EM><BR>
<P>Historically, the Alpha docs have always had errors or omissions.  Not
<BR>
an excuse for RH 6.0, just an observation.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; (4) could have been a show-stopper since not being able to use the Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 6.0 system in anything other then text mode would have been a major
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disappointment. Some help would have been appreciated despite the use of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DEC TGA graphics adapter.
</EM><BR>
<P>TGA support's dodgy at best, from my experience.  Best to (if you
<BR>
can), replace with a card with better X support (Matrox, S3, etc.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In any event, I need to understand what level of support I can expect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; during the 30 day telephone support period and the 90 day email support
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; period.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd search Dejanews (comp.os.linux.alpha newsgroup) or the archives to
<BR>
this mailing list before calling them for support.  You paid for it,
<BR>
but these methods are usually quicker.
<BR>
<P><PRE>
