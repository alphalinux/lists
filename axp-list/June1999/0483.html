<EM>&gt; OK, now that I know whats the problem I can avoid the unaligned access and

<P>&nbsp;Well, unless you interchange non-byte data between architectures all
<BR>
accesses should be aligned by the compiler.  If you cast between types of
<BR>
different alignments, you may make the compiler be aware of wrong
<BR>
alignment by casting the type to an unaligned one.  E.g. you may cast
<BR>
unaligned &quot;int32_t&quot; to &quot;struct { int32_t __attribute__((packed)); }&quot; (it's
<BR>
not written formally but it should give you the idea); I'm told it works
<BR>
with egcs 1.1.2 which will add a necessary code to fetch the whole object
<BR>
properly. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;If you interchange non-byte data between architectures then you have to
<BR>
take care of different endianness anyway and you can simply apply
<BR>
alignment fixes to all places where you swap bytes for correct endianness.
<BR>
This is what I did in the program I am currently porting to multi-arch.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;I also observed the compiler behaviour you described.  I believe it's a
<BR>
bug unless egcs people have a proof it's a feature.  I think the most
<BR>
reasonable (i.e. performance-wise) solution is to change the unaligned
<BR>
load to the aligned one and let the kernel trap it.  Given the compiler
<BR>
can be told explicitly to handle unaligned data this solution seems to be
<BR>
the right one.  Have you reported the bug to egcs folks? 
<BR>
