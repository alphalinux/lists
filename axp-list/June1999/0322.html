1) gettimeofday(), which uses timeval, returns 2 ints from the call to the
<BR>
glibc routines. This is done irrespective of whatever the definition of struct
<BR>
timeval is.  If u define timeval as long, u get bogus looking values. But as
<BR>
int, the numbers look more reasonable.
<BR>
2) By the same token, getrusage() uses the rusage struct, which uses struct
<BR>
timeval. If timeval was defined as 2 ints, like gettimeofday(), then
<BR>
glibc/kernel trashes stack when getrusage() is called.. If timeval is defined
<BR>
as 2 longs, then I dont get a trashed stack.
<BR>
<P>So will the real struct timeval please stand up ?               :-)

Again this is for RH6.0 &amp; alpha

<EM>&gt; First, the parts of struct timeval are int, what means long because int is
