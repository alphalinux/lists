<EM>&gt; Hi all,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Last night I compiled 2.2.7 and 2.2.8 - 2.2.7 and 2.2.8 seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be stable on my machine while 2.2.9 is not.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is somewhat strange.  The main difference between 2.2.9 and 2.2.8
<BR>
is that 2.2.8 had some unfortunate changes in a buffer code; these 2.2.8
<BR>
changes can hose your file systems in right circumstances and 2.2.9
<BR>
backed them off to the previous state (like in 2.2.7).  These are
<BR>
basically all what happened between 2.2.8 and 2.2.9.
<BR>
<P>I would strongly advise __against__ using 2.2.8.  If you have to
<BR>
then go back to 2.2.7 although this one had semaphore troubles
<BR>
on Alpha.  Richard Henderson has various alpha patches for 2.2.9 on
<BR>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.twiddle.net/pub/rth/.">ftp://ftp.twiddle.net/pub/rth/.</A>
<BR>
<P>For myself my latest test version of 2.2.9 has an uptime of 9 days
<BR>
on alpha and nothing bad happened.  I also did 'cat /dev/zero | tail -f'
<BR>
a few times as I heard complaints that 2.2.9 goes haywire on alpha
<BR>
when swap usage reaches over 8 Megs.  The command above has an effect of
<BR>
eating up the whole virtual memory.  I got an expected &quot;Out of memory&quot;
<BR>
but nothing unsightly otherwise.  Shrug!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; These were all compiled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; under the same compiler set (RH6 standard dist).
</EM><BR>
<P>This I do not know.  I am using straight egcs 1.1.2 release which I
<BR>
compiled myself from sources.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has to be a joke!
<BR>
<P>This is an old driver, basically from times of 1.2 - or earlier - kernels,
<BR>
when NCR53c810 was the state of the art, and kept around because somebody
<BR>
may have a very old equipment (in principle NCR53c7xx) which otherwise
<BR>
will not work.  The driver was not really updated for quite a long while.
<BR>
Maybe there were some NCR SCSI controllers used, in practice, with alpha
<BR>
boards which would not work with ncr53c8xx driver.  I have yet to see one
<BR>
even on quite old machines.  A great majority of these will be happy with
<BR>
a newer sym53c8xx.  Some of the current NCR based controllers __require__
<BR>
the last one.
<BR>
<P>OTOH if you really have an Adaptec controller, as the above seem to
<BR>
imply, then which of NCR drivers you try with it is pretty irrelevant. :-)
