<P>Everyone ought to calm down and grow up a little. 
<BR>
<P>Every now and then we all use abbreviations like &quot;IIRC&quot; (if I remember
<BR>
correctly) &quot;YMMV&quot; (your mileage may vary) .. etc. 
<BR>
<P>Using 'u' instead of 'you' is really no different.. it is a phonetic
<BR>
abbreviation. 
<BR>
<P>Getting down on people for using such abbreviations is simple stupid at
<BR>
best. Loads of people are lazy in their use of spoken English -- think
<BR>
of common slurred words and phrases like &quot;gotta&quot; or &quot;hafta&quot; .. we
<BR>
let that slide with no problem -- using 'u' instead of 'you' is just a
<BR>
lazy way of typing. 
<BR>
<P>So.. lets all just calm down, have a few beers.
<BR>
<P>And to those that hold language as a holy cow, I offer some advise
<BR>
when in NY:
<BR>
<P>a) Don't give us a hard time about the accent and bad english
<BR>
<P>b) Remember to get a hot dawg with kraut and mustard from one of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;street vendors before the mayor gets rid of them.

&quot;Our merchants and master-manufacturers complain much of the bad effects
<BR>
of high wages in raising the price, and thereby lessening the sale of
<BR>
their goods both at home and abroad.  They say nothing concerning the bad
<BR>
effects of high profits.  They are silent with regard to the pernicious
<BR>
effects of their own gains.&quot; - Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations, Book I Chap. IX.
