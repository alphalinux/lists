Hi, all;
<BR>
<P>Ok, so I finally got all my parts (SX mobo from Ebay) and put it
<BR>
together. 
<BR>
<P>The machine has AlphaBIOS on it; it came with v5.62 (which I've since
<BR>
upgraded to the v5.66 from DEC's ftp site).  I want to go to SRM,
<BR>
though.  I realize this has been discussed in the past on this list,
<BR>
but it looks like things might have changed since then, and I want to
<BR>
make sure I get it right.  But I'm confused as to the correct part
<BR>
number...  maybe I should just wait until Monday and get on the phone
<BR>
with someone, but I thought someone here might know the answer.
<BR>
<P>In the past, the cheapest solution was to get the Alpha Motherboard
<BR>
SDK, part number QR-21B02-03, which contained the goodies you need to
<BR>
install SRM &quot;from scratch&quot;, among other cool stuff.  However, this
<BR>
part number appears to have been &quot;obsoleted&quot; by a new SDK. 
<BR>
<P>It looks like the new SDK (v4.0) no longer contains the SRM
<BR>
console firmware images - the SDK product brief and &quot;readme first&quot;
<BR>
docs kindly tell the reader that 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alpha SRM Console firmware images that were formerly supplied 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the Alpha Motherboards SDK are now available on a separate 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CD-ROM from COMPAQ:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alpha Systems Firmware Update CD-ROM:	QY-003AA-A8
<BR>
<P>This seems to be the annual subscription service, which I'm not really
<BR>
interested in at this time - I just want the CD and no subscription
<BR>
for quarterly updates.  I did find the above part in a pricelist:
<BR>
<P>QY-003AA-A8    ALPHA AXP CNSL/FW ANN UPDT SV 
<BR>
<P>and at the same time, I saw this:
<BR>
<P>QZ-003AA-E8    ALPHA SYSTEM FW CONSOLE
<BR>
<P>which sounds like it could be what I want, but as I could not find
<BR>
further documentation... 
<BR>
<P>Also could not find references to QT-5VUAA-XA and QB-5VUAA-SA, which
<BR>
are the parts list on the firmware web page.
<BR>
<P>Aaargh.
<BR>
<P>So - what part number do I want?  Just a CD, no subscription.
<BR>
<P>And am I to understand that the quarterly firmware update CDs contain
<BR>
the necessary stuff to install SRM &quot;from scratch&quot;?  Has it always been
<BR>
so?  I've never had to do this before, and have never used the
<BR>
firmware CDs before, so I don't know.
<BR>
<P>Any help would be appreciated.
<BR>
<P>Thanks in advance,
<BR>
Craig
