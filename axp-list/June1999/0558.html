<P>
I dropped out of reading the &quot;bashing&quot; thread of messages a while ago but
<BR>
just dropped in to see the last few postings. I find them a little
<BR>
disturbing in that there are a number of questions raised about the usage
<BR>
of java and its support on Alphas. I opened the licence agreement with the
<BR>
1.2 jdk and was a little supprised by what I read.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From looking at the Sun web site it is obvious that sun only supports sun
</EM><BR>
and Windows/intel.  Other ports are provided by organizations outside sun.
<BR>
<P>The JDK 1.2 comes with a licence that has 2 components.
<BR>
<P>The first is for &quot;internal use only&quot; and implys that I cannot use this
<BR>
software for anything other than evaluation.
<BR>
<P>The second loosens that a little and says that I can develop and
<BR>
distribute code that has been developed with the JDK, but only if I do not
<BR>
create any classes. 
<BR>
<P>I would dearly love to see a real clarification on the above 2 issues by
<BR>
sombody at sun who can speak for the corperation. Marketing hype and trade
<BR>
mag speculation is fine but when you open the package and start using it
<BR>
you are agreeing to the terms of the licence shipped with the software.
<BR>
<P>Off hand this would seen to be a restrictive licence and leads me to
<BR>
believe that dispite sun's hype this is a closed standard.
<BR>
<P>At the end of the day I wonder if it would not be beter to push the
<BR>
develpment of an Open Source, FSF licenced version of the JDK for linux
<BR>
and tell sun &quot;so long and thanks for all the fish&quot;
<BR>
<P>P.S. 
<BR>
Thanks Uncle George for all your work on the alpha port of the JDK. I for
<BR>
one am convinced that we would not have an alpha port if it were not for
<BR>
your efforts.
