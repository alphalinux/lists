have since upgraded to a 600Mhz 21164 with 128MB running RH-6.0 and it

works well.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; thing I had the box handy (I almost threw it out!) - apparently the number's on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the inside box flap on a sticker.  The same number was on my invoice from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Applix, so I assume that's the number.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm, there is a number on the little gatefold sleeve the CD-R came in
<BR>
which I typed in, works for me.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other than 8-bit mode.  Frankly, if it wouldn't run in 24-bit color, I'd have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sent it back.  I'm not quitting everything and restarting X to load an office
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; package that should know how to run on a modern display!  Luckily, it appears
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to run fine in 24-bit mode.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've run it in 8, 16 and 32 bit modes with no problems running on TGA,
<BR>
S3-Virge DX and S3-Trio64.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; * The thick manual (Make It Happen), while very basic was nice to have around -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had more info than the Office 95 manual I got did.  Online help was also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; useful.
</EM><BR>
<P>Its a better manual than the one which came with 4.3.7 anyway.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suspect this might be an X server-related problem (S3 Virge DX or VX using the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; S3V server), though.  I may see if it persists with my Trio card, though it can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only do 16-bit color at 1024x768.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've not noticed any problems with my systems, maybe your X server could
<BR>
do with an upgrade.  You might also be better off using the SVGA server
<BR>
rather than the S3V for your video card, it only supports 16 bit but it is
<BR>
more stable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Excel 97 import is dodgy at best.  On my test file, basically a copy of one of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my typical data spreadsheets, it took a *long* time to import the file - on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; order of 5+ minutes of waiting before I could do anything with it.  This sheet
</EM><BR>
<P>Slow machine, struggle to untangle the mess that is M$ Excel format.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The charts, unfortunately, were mangled beyond recognition.  The axes were
</EM><BR>
<P>This is typical, generally I don't bother to try and import anything from
<BR>
M$ software, I just needed something which works with my machine and which
<BR>
could be used on the rare occasions needed to read someones M$ docs.
<BR>
Word97 docs come in pretty well all things considered.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; incorrect, the titles were all drawn on top of each other, and the data itself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was plotted incorrectly.  Redraw of these charts was also painfully slow.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure what the problem is, my UDB didn't do too badly running
<BR>
Applix, it may be that you're suffering with swapping though, have a look
<BR>
at what free says.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; seconds (!!!) to redraw the preview plot if I stopped typing labels for a few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seconds.  *Extremely* frustrating.
</EM><BR>
<P>Definitely sounds like swapping, it should never be that slow.  Maybe you
<BR>
should try doing something smaller until you get the hang of it.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now a question - has anyone else noticed Applix's sluggishness?  I know, I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not using it on a 600 MHz machine and I'm using fairly beefy datasets, but the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machine I'm comparing this performance to is a Dell P90 with 16 megs RAM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; running Windows 95 with Office 97.  The Dell doesn't choke nearly as bad with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the chart wizard or simply displaying the charts as my Alphastation with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same data sets.  Is there anything I can do about it, or do I have to live with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my Alpha being stomped by a rickety old Dell with less than a fourth the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memory? :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I plan to upgrade the memory of my AS200 to 96 megs, but I doubt this'll speed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up Applix much...
</EM><BR>
<P>Just have a look to see what else the machine is doing when you are
<BR>
running your spreadsheets.  Applix is pretty heavy, but I used to use the
<BR>
Intel version on a 486/33 with 20MB and it was useable and 4.4.1 on my old
<BR>
UDB was pretty snappy.  Personally I am grateful that I have applix, at
<BR>
least I can now submit papers to journals which refuse anything non-M$
<BR>
although I would rather do them in LaTeX but thats life.  Keeps me off the
<BR>
lone PC we have around here at any rate!
