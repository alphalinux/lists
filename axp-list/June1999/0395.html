<EM>&gt; &gt; Check this out, this might help you:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.alphalinux.org/docs/fbcon_faq.shtml">http://www.alphalinux.org/docs/fbcon_faq.shtml</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'v checked this, but i have some questions:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I first compiled the matroxfb in module mode, and after a modprobe the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; screen goes covered by stranges pixels, the box was frozen, only a hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reset unlock it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Did you set a mode for the fb to start in?  For example, &quot;modprobe matroxfb
<BR>
vesa=0x318&quot; (this works with insmod, but I'm not sure about modprobe).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'v compiled it in the kernel and added video:vesa:0x318. This time the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kernel booted correctly, and cat /proc/fb gives me '0 MATROX VGA'.
</EM><BR>
<P>Really?  That's interesting, because it sounds like you're using the vesafb
<BR>
and not matroxfb.  The equivalent to use matroxfb would be
<BR>
&quot;video=matroxfb:vesa:0x118&quot;.  Nonetheless, two interesting points:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* vesafb works on SX/matrox
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* it boots in graphic mode
<BR>
<P>matroxfb hangs for me on LX when trying to boot in any graphic mode, but boots
<BR>
fine in text mode, then I switch mode later using fbset.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Any trie to use fbset results in an error like SETMODE something (dont
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remember the exact error code)
</EM><BR>
<P>Are you using &quot;-accel true&quot; with fbset as is suggested in the FAQ?  This also
<BR>
could be a vesafb/matroxfb issue...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'v downloaded the latest version of ggi (degas snapshot of yesterday) and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compiled libggi with kgi and fbcon support.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; All tries to run a demo result in the same error than with fbset.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know of any analogy to fbset's -accel in ggi, so I'd guess again
<BR>
vesafb/matroxfb.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I' compiled the kgicon module (after fixing a 'register' problem in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;asm/current.h&gt; changing &quot;register struct task_struct *current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; __asm__(&quot;$8&quot;);&quot; to &quot;struct task_struct *current __asm__(&quot;$8&quot;);&quot; maybe this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was not the correct way to fix the error...), i'v compiled the utils part of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the kgicon, instaled the two .o in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; /lib/modules/.../video done a depmod -a and modprobe kgicon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this results in a kernel 'oops':
</EM><BR>
<P>I thought I heard a rumor that kgicon was no longer supported...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Can someone give me an example of fbset parameter to change the mode of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matroxfb...
</EM><BR>
<P>I use: fbset 1280x1024-60 -depth 24 -accel true
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; My system is a SX164, redhat 5.2, kernel 2.3.6 and a matrox millenium II.
</EM><BR>
<P>You see in here a lot of &quot;I heard&quot;, &quot;I thought&quot;.  This is more because I have
<BR>
not been keeping up with the state-of-the-art nearly enough to give definitive
<BR>
answers to your questions, and am probably very wrong on some of them.  You
<BR>
should probably post to the linux-fbdev list (subscription info is given on
<BR>
the FAQ for those interested), though beware: the number of experts in both
<BR>
the framebuffer and Alpha is small enough that you will probably have to do
<BR>
some hacking or digging through motherboard documentation to answer your
<BR>
toughest questions.
<BR>
<P>Hopefully I've given you a couple of things to try so you can give linux-fbdev
<BR>
the most thorough possible report.
<BR>
<P>Good luck, and if you make some progress, please let me know so the Alpha FAQ
<BR>
remains current.
<BR>
<P>P.S.  Part of the problem is that there are several different sources of
<BR>
documentation, including the faq on ALO, the &quot;official&quot; howto linked from it
<BR>
(which I only became aware of recently), and the kernel Documentation/fb
<BR>
directory.  Reading every detail of every piece of every howto on the net just
<BR>
isn't an option, especially when they're in a foreign language, even more so
<BR>
when they contradict each other.  Hopefully the &quot;official&quot; howto will become
<BR>
more complete so the ALO one can go away and things will be more centralized
<BR>
and consistent.  But the maintainer hasn't replied to my patch of over a week
<BR>
ago, so it seems ours will remain for some time...
