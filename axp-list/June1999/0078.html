<P>
First of all, I apologize for this off-topic message, but the reason I
<BR>
am posting this message here is because I consider the
<BR>
Linux/Opensource community the best place where to post this request /
<BR>
offer.
<BR>
<P>Well, my company is a small web presence provider located in Miami, FL
<BR>
and Argentina. We have all our equipment in
<BR>
Miami, FL. We are connected to the Internet with a Frame-relay pipe with
<BR>
a maximum speed of 1.5 Mbps...
<BR>
<P>Because of the location of our main office (Miami, FL) and the hurricane
<BR>
season, we are looking for a similar company in
<BR>
a similar situation, that may be interested in exchanging co-location
<BR>
services, this means, we place a server in the other
<BR>
company's network and they place one in ours, providing a backup server
<BR>
for both companies.
<BR>
<P>I think as we have this need, other small business must have the same,
<BR>
perhaps not having hurricanes, but yes earthquakes,
<BR>
tornados, fires, floods, etc, and I think is a good and cheap ideafor
<BR>
having  a server backup.
<BR>
<P>Any person / business interested in this offer please contact me to my
<BR>
personal e-mail address godel@iwcc.com
<BR>
<P>Thank you for the time spend reading this post and again, I apologize
<BR>
for the offtopic message.
