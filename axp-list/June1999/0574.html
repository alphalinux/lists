<P><EM>&gt; Well you have totally missed that point, I was talking about choice of OS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; NT/Solaris/Linux for users, eg
</EM><BR>
<P>I am aware of what I call &quot;intel centrism&quot;.  When some one says we ported to NT,
<BR>
the intel part is always silent. When  someone says linux, that intel part is also
<BR>
silent. So whenever I hear of a great port, I ask &quot;does it run on the alpha (
<BR>
alpha/nt, alpha/linux )&quot;. The usual answer is, well, no. So to talk of OS without
<BR>
architecture is an 'intel centrism'. to Say Nt/alpha, Nt/intel,
<BR>
Linux/ppc,linux/intel,linux/alpha would be much clearer
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When you want to buy your next alpha chip machine from your compaq
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reseller do you want them to say.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Yes Mr Baeslack, we have a great deal for you, NT comes pre-installed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and only costs $150. You want Linux?, oh we can't do that, not enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; demand. No you cannot have a rebate for the pre-installed software&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I think u are a little outta date. Compaq appears to be on the way of dropping
<BR>
Alpha/NT. I also got tired of asking various vendors what other packages are avail
<BR>
that can run on the alpha .  u just cant imagine how hard it is to get  'nt' device
<BR>
drivers that will work on the alpha. Its exceedingly hard to obtain a copy of the
<BR>
MSc++ on the open market. This is not ur fault, or problem.
<BR>
BTW, u'll find the alpha resellers to be a little more realistic, and savy when it
<BR>
comes to selling alpha computers. I (usually) find them more intellegent, than most
<BR>
of the 'intel centric' vendors.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I did forward your question to our legal department, posting to blackdown-linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; won't make it go any faster. You can read the terms of the scsl license
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without accepting it, that answers some of your other questions in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; meantime. Public aliases are not generally the place to discuss licenses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and contracts terms, although I would suggest you read both licenses carefully.
</EM><BR>
<P>Can I take this as some form of threat?
<BR>
Cant understand Y it is posted to the &quot;legal&quot; department. Does the legal dept run
<BR>
Sun ? shudda have been answerable by any executive.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public places are the best places to talk, and to discuss things that affects
<BR>
that public. It has in the past when it came to discussing the non-commercial
<BR>
licenses.  It has been a forum where one ( and all ) can discuss the document.
<BR>
Other forums, that might be more appropriate, are closed to the general public. or
<BR>
for licensee's eyes only.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For myself, there doesn't appear to be any reason to accept a license, where
<BR>
one does not allow for the 'USE' of the port.  For me the &quot;USE&quot; would be to have it
<BR>
( the JDK )  distributable to the linux community.
