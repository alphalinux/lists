<P>
I read about these problems and i must say, i do not have those problems you
<BR>
all have with overheating multia's,
<BR>
The solution for a better airflow is putting the multia upright in its stand,
<BR>
another thing it if you look at the inside of the multia by the cooler you
<BR>
find a simple dark red temerature-resistance, if you cut of the risistance the
<BR>
cooler will run better and faster without damige to the cooler.
<BR>
The resistance if only for noise reduction so that if the cpu isn't warm it
<BR>
won't make much noise.

<P>&gt; I have seen several postings with this subject, the udb's issue with heat.
&gt;
&gt; I am curious what others have done about it, specifically mods to the case
&gt; (other than keeping the lid off).
&gt;
&gt; I add two 'muffin' fans to the drive side (opposite the large fan).  They
&gt; fit securely in the small channel and draw air from the holes in the case,
&gt; although I enlarged the holes to permit better airflow.  It might be
&gt; possible to put up to 4 or 5 in this channel.
&gt;
&gt; These fans are the typical 40mm type that are placed on a 486-type heat
&gt; sync with fan.  They draw air into the case better than with just the one.
&gt; Each fan produces around 5 cfm and uses 0.08A/12V.
&gt;
&gt; I have also looked at the possibility of modifying the top to mount a fan
&gt; right above the cpu heat sync.
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone done something like this for the UDB/Multia they would like to
&gt; share?
&gt;
&gt; thanks
