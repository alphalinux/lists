<EM>&gt; Er. I'm just going to quietly ask for a little help in becoming someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; else who's got it to compile. If you can help, i'd greatly appreciate it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, it's compiled. I grabbed the M6 tarball from www.mozilla.org,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; untarred it, typed ./configure, then make all and make install . . .
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And it doesn't seem to have put itself anywhere.
</EM><BR>
<P>Look in mozilla/dist/bin. You can invoke the browser with 
<BR>
the command
<BR>
<P>./run-mozilla.sh ./apprunner 
<BR>
<P>from that directory. You will ofcourse need to set the paths
<BR>
if you want to invoke the script from a different directory.
<BR>
<P>./run-mozilla --help should give you a few more tops.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What more magic words do i have to say to get it to install (on my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rh5.1, egcs-1.1.2 system)?
</EM><BR>
<P>I had spent several hours myself to figure this out!! 
<BR>
<P>Enjoy!!
