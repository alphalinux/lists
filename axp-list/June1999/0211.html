<EM>&gt; However, while technically speeking this is a redhat Linux/AXP list I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think many of the RH users would like to see discussion of other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installations.
</EM><BR>
<P>The &quot;other installation&quot;, as far as installation process is involved,
<BR>
is basically the same even if your screen graphics looks somewhat
<BR>
different.  That means that you start with milo and you load from
<BR>
there a ramdisk from which /linuxrc starts installation procedure.
<BR>
<P>The problem with README was that it was not only in German but was
<BR>
also incorrect so it is to your advantage if you cannot consult it. :-)
<BR>
An installation, once started, is pretty obvious.  Like Martin said
<BR>
gobs of things in a resulting system simply do not work.
<BR>
<P>I tried that, but this was a while ago, so I am bit fuzzy on small
<BR>
details.  Yes, I wrote and submitted pretty lengthy report. Let us
<BR>
hope that the upcoming release will be of a better quality.  Unless
<BR>
you are testing and have some experience with Linux and Alpha in
<BR>
particular you DO NOT want this beta.  It had a &quot;very early beta&quot; feel.
