Try this:
<BR>
<P>boot sda3:/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.5-16 root=/dev/sda3
<BR>
<P>I think that /boot/vmlinuz is a symbolic link to vmlinuz-2.2.5-16 and I
<BR>
don't think that MILO handles symbolic links (or am I thinking of SRM??).
<BR>
<P>If you're really stuck you can use the generic floppy image to boot:
<BR>
boot fd0:vmlinux.gz root=/dev/sda3
<BR>
<P>that should get you booted, but the modules won't work as the install
<BR>
kernel is different from the kerel that RH actually installs onto the
<BR>
disk.

<EM>&gt; The subject line says it all really. However, I'll tell you what I've tried
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so you needn't repeat the obvious.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Firstly I had no problems following the &quot;Installing 5.2 on a Ruffian&quot; web
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; page when I put 5.2 on 6 months ago. I based what I was doing on those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instructions. Oh, I'm using Jay's hacked milo from my old 5.2 install days,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I assume a working milo is a working milo, and 6.0 shouldn't change that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I successfully installed an out of the box RH 6 by creating the generic and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ramdisk image diskettes. Probed and Installed like a dream. Wooo! X up on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Permedia _at_last_, briefly...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I then reboot into a Milo console, and try
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boot sda3:/boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/sda3
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (my partitions are NT, swap, root, ext&lt;usr, var, usr/local, home, tmp&gt;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The 5.2 instructions were &quot;boot sda?:vmlinux.gz root=/dev/sda?&quot; so I had a few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; minutes hunting around my disk using milo's ls command, and I thought I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; found the right file, but alas maybe not...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I get an unreadable message which disappears under a flood of many screens
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; full of #s, and then it halts with some whiney message about a bad record
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (bugger, it was 2am at the time I forgot where I put the piece of paper I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wrote the message on)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can use ls in milo and stuff, and there were many other files in /boot/,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is the vmlinuz@ the correct one to use? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Can I create a boot floppy of an image on the CD, or from FTP/HTTP that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will drop me straight into my intended setup? (I used F2 to get a console
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using the install boot disk, but no mount points or devices were present,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so had troubles doing anything at all)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Cheers for your patience,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Phil
