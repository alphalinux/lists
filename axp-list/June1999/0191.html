<P>
I've discovered after much trial and error, that a Redhat (5.2 or 6.0)
<BR>
install fails if I attempt to install it on a system that has at least
<BR>
one disk in it that doesn't have a PC-style partition table on it.
<BR>
<P>Specifically, I have an AS200/233 and a Multia.  Both have at least one
<BR>
disk that has VMS on it, and hence, those disks don't contain a PC-style
<BR>
partition table.  When the RH installation process sees this, it goes
<BR>
apes**t, then aborts with a &quot;signal 11 trapped&quot;.  If I pull these disks
<BR>
out so that they can't be seen, the installation goes just fine.  I 
<BR>
suspect that the install process is seeing &quot;garbage&quot; from the sector
<BR>
that's supposed to contain a valid MBR, and it goes up in smoke trying to
<BR>
act as if it's valid.
<BR>
<P>Obviously, this is a problem.  I've noticed also that once Linux is 
<BR>
installed, it doesn't matter if the other disks are there or not.  It
<BR>
simply reports a bad magic for them (as you would expect).
<BR>
<P>Anybody have a solution for this?  It's a genuine pain in the neck, 
<BR>
especially since for my AS200 system, I have to open it up and remove
<BR>
the SCSI cable to the VMS drive to install Linux.
