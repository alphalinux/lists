<EM>&gt;  Let me give you a real example.  I have a stream of compressed data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; created on a 16-bit machine.  It is a mixture of 8-bit and 16-bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unsigned quantities.  How would you handle it most efficiently?
</EM><BR>
<P>Looking at a generated assembler it seems to me that an efficiency of
<BR>
reading that as a stream of unsigned bytes and composing required 16-bit
<BR>
values by &quot;shift and add&quot; is grossly underestimated. :-) I grant that
<BR>
there are tougher cases than that.  OTOH Intel processors also take a
<BR>
performance hit for unaligned acceses although, I understand, this
<BR>
overhead is quite a bit smaller in an Intel case and they are also quiet
<BR>
about it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; or use &quot;((uint16_s *)&amp;(x))-&gt;v&quot; cast (where &quot;uint16_s&quot; is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; defined as &quot;typedef struct { uint16_t v __attribute__((packed)); }
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; uint16_s;&quot;) to access 16-bit ones.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hm, I never thought about &quot;__attribute__((packed))&quot; trick.  This would
<BR>
make code, obviosly, quite gcc specific but likely this can be hidden
<BR>
in some reasonably looking macros defined differently for gcc and
<BR>
others.  But did you look at what happens on an assembler level
<BR>
(I did not - for your examples); &quot;packed&quot; is not coming for free.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One can use &quot;uint8_t&quot; fetches with appropriate shifting and ORing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (it's still necessary on different-endian machines even though some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; archs have explicit support for most common endianness convertions)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but this wastes a lot of unnecessary cycles. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I bet that a lot less than an unaligned trap. :-)  C Standard is also
<BR>
full of dire warnings about mixing different pointer types (or using
<BR>
casts to hide that practice).  I guess that this is not without a reason
<BR>
even if sounds like anal in places.
<BR>
<P>Somebody send me a while ago samples of a code which were supposedly
<BR>
showing up an aliasing bug of egcs-1.1.2.  I did not try them on Intel
<BR>
but there was not a trace of bad results on Alpha.  Maybe one needs much
<BR>
more of a register presure before bad things will start to happen?  I do
<BR>
not know.  Out of sheer curiosity I rewrote one example to use unions
<BR>
instead of playing &quot;efficient&quot; pointer games.  Resulting assembler was
<BR>
smaller and better for union approach as opposed to the &quot;efficient&quot; one.
<BR>
In this case everything was aligned anyway as variables were defined on
<BR>
stack.  But this IS a food for though.
