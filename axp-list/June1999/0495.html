<P>
I'm finally got my spare UDB up and running headless, diskless and
<BR>
floppyless.  I boot linux (2.0.35) from SRM serial console with bootp
<BR>
(however, I couldn't get RH 5.2 alpha bootpd to work and had to use an
<BR>
i386 bootpd.)  It mounts NFS root OK and inittab starts a serial login
<BR>
along with sshd.  It runs nicely with 16MB memory (no NFS swap).  It
<BR>
will become a firewall for my cable modem.
<BR>
<P>I get one strange problem, it can't mount another directory (such as
<BR>
/usr.)  I found that rpcinfo didn't return anything, although it works
<BR>
fine from an Intel machine (The NFS server is another UDB) and works
<BR>
fine locally.  So, it is not an Alpha nor a server setting issue.  All
<BR>
services and exports (protected by tcpd) are open to the whole subnet.
<BR>
<P>My headless UDB file system is striped to &lt; 10 MB.  Maybe I took out
<BR>
something rpcinfo was looking for?  However, strace didn't tell me
<BR>
that is that case.  My network setting seems to be OK.  I can ssh in
<BR>
and telnet out.  It didn't makes any difference after I manually added
<BR>
lo interface and routing.
