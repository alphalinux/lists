The distance between the core published API and the actual layer at which
<BR>
system services requests are made, is very far. The is a set of .java routines
<BR>
that just dont get changed, and are common between win&amp;solaris machines. Then
<BR>
there is a set of '.java' routines, that are particular to windoz, and a set
<BR>
for solaris ports. These particular java routines take care of the necessary
<BR>
transslations between the OS and the core java routines that just dont get
<BR>
changed.  System pecularities should never have to go beyond the 'system'
<BR>
interface routines, or bubble up to, or beyond these service routines.
<BR>
<P>But eventually someone is gonna want to try to build a &gt;4gig file ( &gt;32bit
<BR>
seeks )  on the alpha/linux box. Maybe someone is gonna try to read from a
<BR>
16gig file. These are all valid uses. And Should I limit these people to 32bit
<BR>
file sizes, or allow them the full use of the OS capabilities? And what of the
<BR>
reverse - If I create a 14gig file on alpha/linux using the Alpha JDK and
<BR>
attempt to shuve it onto an intel box, you may not be able to move that file to
<BR>
that intel box., because the file system may not be able to handle that file
<BR>
size.  Would u blame the OS, the Intel JDK, or the Alpha JDK.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;From the front everything appears to be homogenious, (even on my alpha/linux
</EM><BR>
port ) but in the back there are some real life issues. And they tend to get
<BR>
resolved without the java user ever noticing.
<BR>
<P>Tell me, did Microsoft alter the published core API to suit their own
<BR>
sensibilities? I dont know, as I didnt pay much attention. Or did they just
<BR>
manipulate the back-end services.

<EM>&gt; &gt;Actually u do have to change the '.java' files ( simply for practicable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;convience ). Having extensive experience in porting sun's JDK, I find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;it rather difficult to store 64bits into a 32bit java int.  Maybe u can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;review the java-linux-porting diffs of their 1.2 port.  I'd like to know,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;for example, how the solaris printer 'queue' switches was changed to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;compatable with linux printer 'queue' commands.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Where do 32/64bit differences on the platform bubble up to the java.*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; level that you would need to change this? If there are such locations,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these should be reported as bugs because on the java level you shouldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be able to determine the native wordsize of the underlying platform.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Changing the wordsize of standard API level interfaces during a port
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would completely defeat the purpose of the virtual machine, and I for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one are very glad that Sun wouldn't allow this. If your Alpha port
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has changed ints and longs in API .java files it's just as much Java
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as Microsoft's stuff is...
