<P><EM>Craig&gt; I understand.  Have you tried fdisk?  I was able to use fdisk to
</EM><BR>
<EM>Craig&gt; partition the drive I wanted to install to without using the Win95
</EM><BR>
<EM>Craig&gt; disk.  I just did the Win95 boot disk to see if Disk Druid was looking
</EM><BR>
<EM>Craig&gt; for primary dos partition, and apparently it was.  I had this problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>Craig&gt; with a disk that had Suse 6.1 on it, and I had used fdisk to partion it
</EM><BR>
<EM>Craig&gt; for Suse.  When I loaded the RH 6.0 CD and booted it all went fine up to
</EM><BR>
<EM>Craig&gt; the point where I tried to use Disk Druid to repartion my drive, then it
</EM><BR>
<EM>Craig&gt; dumped with the same error you had.  I then rebooted and used fdisk with
</EM><BR>
<EM>Craig&gt; no problems and the install proceeded as normal.  I have two other disks
</EM><BR>
<EM>Craig&gt; in this machine and neither one of them have a dos partion on them but
</EM><BR>
<EM>Craig&gt; they didn't interfere with Disk Druid during the install, it was just
</EM><BR>
<EM>Craig&gt; the drive I was installing to that gave me problems.
</EM><BR>
<P>I avoid disk druid like the plague. fdisk does everything you need, I've
<BR>
never known it to not cope with any drive, or any previous partitioning.
<BR>
(Basically I can't get disk druid to _not_ create extended partitions)
<BR>
fdisk is quicker to use as you don't have to waste time tabbing all over
<BR>
the shop to get to hit the silly buttons (and no, I can't reach the function
<BR>
keys and still stay on the home keys). What was the problem to which disk
<BR>
druid is the solution? Fdisk forever!
<BR>
<P>Sorry, I'm in a ranting mood today.
