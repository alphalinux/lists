<P>
it does in RH 6.0 with glibc2.1. In redhat 5.x, with glibc2.0.7 it doesn't. This
<BR>
also was reported by someone else. Timeval was defined with 2 longs for
<BR>
gettimeofday(), but apparently the glib/kern returned 2 ints. I suspect glib, as I
<BR>
use the same kern for 5.x &amp; 6.0. If i'm not mistaken, u ssaid this was a posix
<BR>
change.
<BR>
<P>I will review again my 6.0 installation, since u appear to suggest that timeval
<BR>
has 2 longs, but i suspect that gettimeofday() will return ints :-/
