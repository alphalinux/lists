</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt; &gt; works well.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I suspect it *would* work well on a 600 MHz 21164.  :)  Have you tried plotting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; large (5000 point or so) datasets on the UDB, as a point of comparison?
</EM><BR>
<P>Give me a data set and I'll give it a go.  I have the UDB here at work now
<BR>
doing sterling service as a firewall/masq box.  Amazed that the Intel
<BR>
10/100 PCI ether card worked first time unlike the video card hell I went
<BR>
through!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I've run it in 8, 16 and 32 bit modes with no problems running on TGA,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; S3-Virge DX and S3-Trio64.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That was based on the warnings in the release notes.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I remember reading that and thinking at the time it was odd because I
<BR>
had it running in 16 bit mode from the outset.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; rather than the S3V for your video card, it only supports 16 bit but it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; more stable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Heh.  Stability is the precise reason I was using the S3V server *instead* of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the SVGA server.  The SVGA server and neither of my virge cards get along very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well, unfortunately.
</EM><BR>
<P>Is that with XFree86-3.3.3?  I did have problems with S3 based cards in
<BR>
earlier incarnations but with 3.3.3 the SVGA driver worked like a charm
<BR>
and never gave me a problem.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Word97 docs come in pretty well all things considered.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Like I said, I've really only tried the spreadsheet.
</EM><BR>
<P>Different uses.  I've only used the spreadsheet a few times for plotting
<BR>
data, most of the stuff I do I can achieve with gnuplot.  Fortunately I
<BR>
never have to process large set of numbers.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Applix, it may be that you're suffering with swapping though, have a look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; at what free says.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Could it be that the charting module simply doesn't deal well with large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; datasets?  Swapping isn't an issue here (I checked *that* before my last mail
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; :) ).
</EM><BR>
<P>May well be.  You could always ask Applix what the deal is.  It doesn't
<BR>
sound like something that they would be able to ignore.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Definitely sounds like swapping, it should never be that slow.  Maybe you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; should try doing something smaller until you get the hang of it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That *was* one of the smaller datasets. ;)  Like I said, using a template gets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me past most of the &quot;step by step&quot; pain, but Applix's performance is nowhere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; near the level of MS Excel 97.  It seems CPU-bound, by the way, when it's
</EM><BR>
<P>Odd.  The thought that MS could have produced an efficient program boggles
<BR>
the mind somewhat.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; drawing the charts, though no swapping is occuring.  I'm still going to try a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different video card/X server to see if it's something peculiar with my setup. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe it's an X thing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Try the latest SVGA server with acceleration on and see how you get on.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; points and markers really need to be drawn?  I suspect Excel here isn't drawing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all 5000 for the preview plot (it doesn't need to - it's just a preview) and is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; getting a speed boost here.
</EM><BR>
<P>True.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Intel version on a 486/33 with 20MB and it was useable and 4.4.1 on my old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; UDB was pretty snappy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The unfortunate problem is that on a 233 MHz Alpha with 80 megs of RAM, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seems more sluggish than on a new comparison machine - a 486 DX2/66 with 16
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; megs running Windows 95 and Office 97.  Ouch.  (The 16 meg Windows boxes do hit
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm, sound really nasty.  I have used Office 97 on a pentium and found it
<BR>
sucks enourmously.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Windowmaker dock apps (wmmon, wmweather, wmgrabimage, wmmail, etc.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Nice and light.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Personally I am grateful that I have applix,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sure, but I think we want the best product we can have.  This is particularly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; important when as of yet we don't really have any other choice on the Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; platform.  At least on my Celeron I can run Star Office (or WP8 for word
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; processing) as well as Applix.  This isn't an &quot;Applix sucks&quot; type of post - I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just concerned that it's not seeming to measure up to Excel on &quot;lesser&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machines on my datasets.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, go talk to Applix and see what they say.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; although I would rather do them in LaTeX but thats life.  Keeps me off the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; lone PC we have around here at any rate!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's a good thing that historically exporting has worked better than importing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ;)
</EM><BR>
<P>A much easier proposition to write out something which can be read by M$
<BR>
code than to read in from an M$ format.  It seems even M$ can't get their
<BR>
programs to work, I tried to import a Word6 doc into Word97 and it ended
<BR>
up as a blank sheet although if I printed it everything was there.  Odd to
<BR>
say the least.
