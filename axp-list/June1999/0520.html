<EM>&gt; I was wondering what scsi controllers people have had the best luck with

<P>I've got an Intraserver 3140 in a 164SX at home.  Seems to perform
<BR>
quite well.  At work, we have a bunch of 164LX machines, some using the
<BR>
Qlogic ISP 1040B and others using the Intraserver, also with no
<BR>
problems.
<BR>
<P>I've seen plenty of reports of problems with the Adaptec cards on this
<BR>
list, though they do seem to work fine for some folks.
<BR>
<P>IIRC, I think I paid about $140 for the Intraserver card, but this was
<BR>
a while ago.
<BR>
<P>You can get a better idea of prices at www.streetprices.com or
<BR>
www.pricewatch.com, for example.  
<BR>
<P>Probably a better recommendation, though, is to call up your favorite
<BR>
Alpha/Linux-friendly vendor; they should know best what works well and
<BR>
what doesn't, and would be happy to sell you a good board, I'm sure.
<BR>
Check the list of vendors at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.alphalinux.org/hardware/vendors.shtml.">http://www.alphalinux.org/hardware/vendors.shtml.</A>  You might also want
<BR>
to check out the vendor's web sites, as they might say what cards they
<BR>
put in the machines they sell.
<BR>
<P>Hope that helps,
<BR>
