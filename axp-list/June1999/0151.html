[Description of spreadsheet test file]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'd love to get a copy of this file (send via private e-mail) that we can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take a look at, pass on to our filters developers, etc.  We continue to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; working to improve our filters, so any more data points (pun intended :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can only help.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll work up a similar set (Excel 97 workbook and a corresponding Applix
<BR>
workbook) sometime this week for you that should demonstrate the
<BR>
importation (and sluggishness) issues.
<BR>
<P>FWIW, I tried Star Office 5.0 on Intel on a similar Excel workbook and
<BR>
it simply locked up.  Applix's filters at least gave me data.  Don't
<BR>
know how SO 5.1/Intel stacks up yet.
<BR>
<P>Since last night / this morning, I've made some changes to my
<BR>
machine.  I upgraded the memory to 96 megs (from 80).  Swapping didn't
<BR>
seem to be an issue before, but I'll check again.
<BR>
<P>One thing that helped a good bit was (as was previously mentioned by
<BR>
another poster) switching out the video card to a card that worked
<BR>
with a decent X server.  The problem that grid lines in
<BR>
spreadsheets sometimes are drawn outside the spreadsheet window
<BR>
appears to be a problem with the XF86_S3V server, as it's also
<BR>
reproducible with Applixware 4.37 (I think ... whatever the last
<BR>
version of Redhat-sold Applixware was :) ) on an Intel box using the
<BR>
same server.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I noticed the Alpha's sluggishness in general during development, and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; somewhat suspect the compiler as being less than optimal at this point in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time
</EM><BR>
<P>I think the majority of the list would agree with the compiler not yet
<BR>
being up to speed.  Would forcing use of the Compaq math libraries or
<BR>
libffm (using LD_PRELOAD) help any?  I notice that applix parts are
<BR>
linked with libm.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; -- I am comparing performance with Applixware running on a Linux/Intel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; box.  But nothing like you've mentioned.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't have an Intel box of comparable speed to my Alpha (my
<BR>
Intel/Linux box is a Celeron 300A OC'd to 450 - much faster than this
<BR>
AS200 4/233), but I'm going to try to work up a similar dataset in my
<BR>
old version of Applix at home (couldn't afford at this point to
<BR>
buy the new Intel version *and* the Alpha version) and see how the
<BR>
much faster machine chews on the data.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Still, I'll pass on the word to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; our spreadsheet developers so they can try to attack the issues you've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mentioned.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks.  At any rate, at least I can process data now at my desk
<BR>
rather than at the (overcrowded) data collection station.
<BR>
<P><PRE>
