<P>
<EM>&gt; I recently installed RH6.0 on my alpha and i've noticed that the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; included mpg123 player isn't performing very good. It's not able to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decode the MP3 files realtime, it keeps dropping frames all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time.
</EM><BR>
<P>Is this under X or at the command line?  I've noticed that playing
<BR>
mp3s and running X together seems to be right at the edge of a
<BR>
Multia's abilities (could be the terribly slow TGA X server causing 
<BR>
part of the problem, but I digress ...)
<BR>
<P>I have a Multia running RH5.2 with a 2.2.4 kernel that can play mp3s
<BR>
without any trouble from the command line, and can play mp3s usually
<BR>
without much trouble from gqmpeg running as the only app under X at
<BR>
640x480 resolution (my Multia is hooked up to a TV).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; worked perfect with RH5.2). Could it be that the new 2.2.X kernels 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are slower with sound or something??
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe it's something else under RH, or maybe it's a problem with a
<BR>
later kernel than 2.2.4.
<BR>
<P>Wonder if libffm or Compaq's math libraries would help here ...
<BR>
