<EM>&gt; Now, someone could do this anyway, with a clean-room implementation (and in

</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From what I have heard Microsoft has not done a clean-room
</EM><BR>
implementation.  They are a Java licensee.  I don't know about their
<BR>
recent work, but the early stuff was clearly a derivative of the JDK.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; On the other hand, some people don't care about Java source, and only care
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that there's a JDK for their platform.  This is the blackdown.org
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; philosophy.  I'm sure they'd opt for an open-source license if they could, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they can't so they settle for the restrictions of the SCSL, especially since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sun licensed them the JCK for free (which is Sun's &quot;support&quot; of the blackdown
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; project.)  Having a closed-source JDK is better than no JDK in their eyes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which is also a perfectly valid point.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed.  Sun has received overwhelming interest in a supported JDK for
<BR>
Linux; they are going about it by helping the blackdown folks.  Linux
<BR>
users should appreciate what they've done.  After all the JDK is
<BR>
commercial software and closed source.
<BR>
<P>Anyone who doesn't like their policy doesn't have to use Sun's software...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...and here's where I get back on topic for this list. :)  If you want a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; truly free JDK for the Alpha, you want either Kaffe or Japhar.  Kaffe seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be further along than Japhar.  (Does Japhar even run at all on the Alpha?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I haven't played with it.)
</EM><BR>
<P>...and fortunately there are alternatives.  Kaffe didn't work well when I
<BR>
tried it, and I don't know anything about Japhar.  I've been experimenting
<BR>
with Cygnus' gcj for a couple of months though, and I'm very pleased with
<BR>
this software.  It's a natural fit for anyone experienced with gcc/egcs.
<BR>
It's not a bytecode interpreter, but that doesn't matter at all to me (it
<BR>
can compile .class -&gt; .o or .java -&gt; .o, so it can still run third-party
<BR>
classes).  It's also not production-quality and there are no stable
<BR>
releases yet, but it is progressing very well.  I will soon be running
<BR>
&quot;real&quot; applications with it.  (And, most importantly, it builds/runs on
<BR>
Alpha/Linux!)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Some people don't like Kaffe, though, since the license holder is Transvirtual,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which also licenses Kaffe under a proprietary commercial license.  In fact,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there are effectively two Kaffe codebases:  the GPL version and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Transvirtual version.  Transvirtual keeps the two trees strictly separate,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so the noise you hear about Microsoft paying Transvirtual to make proprietary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MS extensions to Kaffe does *not* affect the GPL version of the code.  You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can contribute to the GPL version without agreeing to assign your code over to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Transvirtual for use in their product.
</EM><BR>
<P>Cygnus is a commercial company too... like Transvritual, they offer two
<BR>
licences for their software.  Unlike Transvirtual they have one codebase
<BR>
for both.  I have no problem with either company... having open source
<BR>
available is extremely liberating, especially if you've been using Sun's
<BR>
software too long ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Unfortunately, Kaffe is not as far along on the Alpha as it is on Intel.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; JIT does not work on the Alpha, and a few other things need work.  Still,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; progress is being made.  I do use Kaffe as the JVM for the Servlet engine I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have running on my home machine, so it does run, it's just not blazing fast.
</EM><BR>
<P>True.  It is extremely difficult to build a quality JIT compiler
<BR>
for any platform, and both the &quot;free&quot; VMs and the blackdown porters suffer
<BR>
compared to commercially-available JDKs, especially on Intel.  It bothers
<BR>
me that I develop on Alpha, the best price/performance around (IMHO), but
<BR>
can't run Java code nearly as well as my NT/Intel friends can.  I started
<BR>
looking for alternatives to JIT technology, that's when I discovered
<BR>
native Java compilers are already available... I used Toba before gcj
<BR>
(Toba is unfortunately no longer developed).  My Alpha no longer has to be
<BR>
embarassed ;)
