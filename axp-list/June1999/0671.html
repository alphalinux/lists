<P>
I've been having the same instability problems listed on the various
<BR>
other threads about RH6.0.  
<BR>
<P>This is an lx164 running a clean RH6.0 installation plus the rpms from
<BR>
updates.redhat.com
<BR>
<P>Problems:
<BR>
-The system will reboot spontaneously.  
<BR>
<P>-The kernel (2.2.5, 2.2.7, 2.2.10) appears to have memory leaks.  I can
<BR>
do something simple like compile a kernel (without kernel modules
<BR>
loaded or X running) and suddenly find memory use at 180M when all is
<BR>
done and I'm sitting at a shell prompt with next to nothing running.
<BR>
<P>-The most frequent problem is a SEGV to my X process which locks the
<BR>
display.  Then I switch to another box on my lan and ssh over to
<BR>
reboot it.  And not I'm not running the Font Server.  The problem
<BR>
persists using gdm or not.  
<BR>
<P>-There are other X failure modes which are somewhat less severe.
<BR>
&nbsp;These seems to involve unaligned traps and so forth from various X
<BR>
&nbsp;things.
<BR>
<P>- A nagging problem is that I can't compile any large package (like
<BR>
the kernel) in one attempt.  cc gets a variety of nasty signals or
<BR>
outright confused about how to compile something.  Running the make
<BR>
again will get me further through the package.  The same stopping
<BR>
points aren't repeated on attempts to replicate the scenario, so it
<BR>
appears to be a problem outside the compilation system itself.
<BR>
<P>- miscellaneous applications (e.g. bash, emacs, ncftp) will experience
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the same mysterious signal of death that X gets in a non-repeatable
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;way.
<BR>
<P>All these problems happen across all three kernel version listed
<BR>
<P>So far 2.2.7 seems to be the best of the lot, 2.2.10 was a nightmare.
<BR>
But frankly the situation sucks.  From reading the axp-list archive I
<BR>
can't really determine what combination of kernel patches and systemic
<BR>
upgrades I should undertake.
<BR>
<P>I've gone from uptimes measured in months down to hours here.  What do
<BR>
I do to fix it?  There are some really nice things in 2.2, but they
<BR>
don't do me much good when the system crashes more often than windoze.
<BR>
<P>I'd prefer to make it work under RH6, but if they've solved this in
<BR>
SuSE or Debian I'll abandon Redhat in a heartbeat.
