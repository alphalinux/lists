It was a much easier install than 5.2, as network install works fine.

<P>I think the key is to make sure you don't have any unsupported hardware
<BR>
in the DS20.  One of our DS20 was a very &quot;nice&quot; model with two SCSI
<BR>
controllers (one of them a fancy raid thing).  We had to take out all
<BR>
of the &quot;excess&quot; controllers.  We took out the graphics board that
<BR>
came with it, and replaced it with one of the old ones from our other
<BR>
Alphastations.  Then it installed fine.
<BR>
I only get 640x400.. (not using the console, so I don't care yet)
<BR>
<P>I used the bootdisk/ramdisk that came with 6.0.
<BR>
The 6.0 that I used was ftp'ed from gatekeeper.dec.com, as I
<BR>
doubt the official 6.0 for Alpha is available in Japan yet..
