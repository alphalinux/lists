<P>
<EM>&gt; After taking one of my little multias to RH 6.0 and having numerous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problems. (most of which have come up again and again on the list) I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; backdated to 5.2 and just upgraded the kernel to 2.2.7 (for now) It really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looks like 6.0 is not ready for prime time with the alpha, there are just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; too many bugs. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I've got a multia running RH 5.2 and 2.2.4 (I think - it's either 4 or
<BR>
5 :) ) without problems.  Of course, this isn't a production machine
<BR>
and it's not on all the time. so I can't vouch for long-term
<BR>
stability on that machine/kernel combination.  I turn it on when I
<BR>
want to listen to mp3s in the other room.
<BR>
<P>5.1, though, wasn't really that bad - all things considered.  5.1 was
<BR>
the first Alpha install I attempted, and after applying the errata
<BR>
fixes, I was left with a very stable machine.  True. some of RH 5.1's
<BR>
Alpha bugs were asinine (Come on guys, *man* is broken enough to
<BR>
immediately dump core and you don't notice???), but overall I got a
<BR>
stable system out of it.  I still run essentially that system now on
<BR>
my desktop Alpha - with the various updates that have come out since
<BR>
for 5.1 and 5.2.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm just gonna guess here, or does it ALWAYS seem to be that the best RH
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distributions end in 2?? 4.2, 5.2 ??  Do I have to wait until 6.2 for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good, stable, everything works more and not less distribution??  
</EM><BR>
<P>6.1 might be decent. :)
<BR>
