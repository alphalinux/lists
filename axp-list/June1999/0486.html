<P><EM>&gt; I have been assigned with some simulation work which demands a quite

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  What is the largest amount of memory an alpha box running Linux can make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use of?
</EM><BR>
<P>Linux has a memory limit of 2Gig currently. This is not an Alpha
<BR>
limitation but rather a Linux limitation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How quick is the quickest Alpha chip available and how does it compare
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the quickest intel can offer (a PIII 550)?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Unfortunately the software I am gona use is not parallelized so I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stuck with a single processor machine)
</EM><BR>
<P>You may want to look at the new motherboard from Alpha Processor Inc
<BR>
(UP2000) it's SMP capable but will run fine with only one. 
<BR>
<P>It will support processors at 667MHz (2 and 4MB cache) and 750MHz (8MB
<BR>
cache).
