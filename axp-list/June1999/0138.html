<P>
I purchased and installed Applix for Alpha ($99, direct from Applix) onto my
<BR>
AS200 4/233 (80M RAM, Redhat 5.1 plus fixes with 2.0.35 kernel recompiled for
<BR>
sound support) last week, hoping I could use it for some of my data workups. 
<BR>
Seeing as it's really the only &quot;complete&quot; office package out there for
<BR>
Linux/Alpha, my choices were somewhat limited.  My experiences:
<BR>
<P>* Installation was easy.  Mount CD, cd to it, and run the install script. 
<BR>
There was only one hitch - the question about the customer number.  I didn't
<BR>
see this in the instructions, and the screen says it's &quot;on the box&quot;.  Good
<BR>
thing I had the box handy (I almost threw it out!) - apparently the number's on
<BR>
the inside box flap on a sticker.  The same number was on my invoice from
<BR>
Applix, so I assume that's the number.
<BR>
<P>* The release notes could use some work.  Alpha is printed on the first page,
<BR>
but most of the stuff inside was for intel.  The instructions for installation
<BR>
appeared to be incorrect, at least with regards to the name of the install
<BR>
script.  Some things scared me, like the warning about running in anything
<BR>
other than 8-bit mode.  Frankly, if it wouldn't run in 24-bit color, I'd have
<BR>
sent it back.  I'm not quitting everything and restarting X to load an office
<BR>
package that should know how to run on a modern display!  Luckily, it appears
<BR>
to run fine in 24-bit mode.
<BR>
<P>* I like the penguin. :)
<BR>
<P>* The thick manual (Make It Happen), while very basic was nice to have around -
<BR>
had more info than the Office 95 manual I got did.  Online help was also
<BR>
useful.
<BR>
<P>* The only one of the components I've used for any length of time so far is the
<BR>
spreadsheet - which was effectively what I bought the package for in the first
<BR>
place.  I notice that the window refreshing is still somewhat buggy with
<BR>
gridlines turned on - the gridlines don't stay in the spreadsheet - they wander
<BR>
into the toolbars and persist where they shouldn't.  I noticed this in the
<BR>
Intel version (4.37 - haven't decided whether to upgrade at home) too.  I
<BR>
suspect this might be an X server-related problem (S3 Virge DX or VX using the
<BR>
S3V server), though.  I may see if it persists with my Trio card, though it can
<BR>
only do 16-bit color at 1024x768.
<BR>
<P>Excel 97 import is dodgy at best.  On my test file, basically a copy of one of
<BR>
my typical data spreadsheets, it took a *long* time to import the file - on the
<BR>
order of 5+ minutes of waiting before I could do anything with it.  This sheet
<BR>
had five &quot;plain data&quot; worksheets (no calculations), a calculation sheet, and
<BR>
two chart sheets.  The charts were scatterplots with lines but no markers,
<BR>
composed of five series with approximately 1000 data points each.
<BR>
<P>The charts, unfortunately, were mangled beyond recognition.  The axes were
<BR>
incorrect, the titles were all drawn on top of each other, and the data itself
<BR>
was plotted incorrectly.  Redraw of these charts was also painfully slow.
<BR>
<P>I deleted these charts by deleting their sheets (also an unusually slow
<BR>
process) and saved the numerical data and calculations as an Applix native
<BR>
sheet to eveluate the charting capabilities of the spreadsheet (again, this is
<BR>
what I purchased Applix for - data manipulation and charting).
<BR>
<P>I set the chart preferences to &quot;XY&quot; and data sorted in columns before
<BR>
beginning, using the spreadsheet preferences menu.  I then proceeded to hilight
<BR>
the data to plot (6 columns of about a thousand cells each, first column was X
<BR>
values).  As I normally do in Excel, the first row contained labels for each
<BR>
column of data.
<BR>
<P>I used the &quot;Step by Step&quot; tool to graph the data as lines without
<BR>
markers.  Or rather, I *attempted* to graph the data.  After selecting the type
<BR>
of plot (XY, lines without markers) I was presented with a partially rendered
<BR>
Step 4 of 5 box and the error message (not verbatim - I'm not at my Alpha at
<BR>
the moment) &quot;Can't plot more than 700 points in a pie chart&quot;.  Clicking OK
<BR>
returned me to the range selection step (Step 1).  This is odd, because at no
<BR>
time did I select a pie chart!  (Bug in Spreadsheet program, I assume).  I
<BR>
noticed that in the partially rendered &quot;Step 4&quot; box, the incorrect options were
<BR>
selected (data in rows was selected and &quot;first row for legend text&quot; was
<BR>
unselected) instead of the options I'd made my defaults previously.  I
<BR>
wasn't able to change these, as I couldn't click on the options due to the
<BR>
error box being up, and closing the error box immediately returned me to
<BR>
Step 1.  After repeated attempts to change chart type and get the data to plot
<BR>
(and some foul language), I found out that I could plot the data if I didn't
<BR>
select the row of labels.  Whew.  My first plot using this newfound knowledge,
<BR>
unfortunately, was made using the lines with markers chart type.  Big mistake. 
<BR>
When trying to enter the chart labels in Step 4, Applix would take sometimes 45
<BR>
seconds (!!!) to redraw the preview plot if I stopped typing labels for a few
<BR>
seconds.  *Extremely* frustrating.
<BR>
<P>Changing to lines without markers made the above more bearable, but it was
<BR>
still slower than it &quot;should&quot; be.  I'm not used to waiting 10 seconds before
<BR>
being able to enter the Y axis title. :)  Luckily, saving templates does work
<BR>
(after a 1 minute load/draw by the Graphics module), so I don't have to go
<BR>
through step-by-step often.
<BR>
<P>Another questionable behavior: When entering titles for the legend, if you
<BR>
enter anything resembling a cell reference, it takes it as such - with
<BR>
unpredictable results.  I entered &quot;LS20000&quot; as a label and Applix took that as
<BR>
a cell reference, and filled its line in the legend with garbage characters. 
<BR>
The cell reference was my goof-up, but Applix shouldn't have put garbage
<BR>
characters in my chart.
<BR>
<P>Now a question - has anyone else noticed Applix's sluggishness?  I know, I'm
<BR>
not using it on a 600 MHz machine and I'm using fairly beefy datasets, but the
<BR>
machine I'm comparing this performance to is a Dell P90 with 16 megs RAM
<BR>
running Windows 95 with Office 97.  The Dell doesn't choke nearly as bad with
<BR>
the chart wizard or simply displaying the charts as my Alphastation with the
<BR>
same data sets.  Is there anything I can do about it, or do I have to live with
<BR>
my Alpha being stomped by a rickety old Dell with less than a fourth the
<BR>
memory? :)
<BR>
<P>I plan to upgrade the memory of my AS200 to 96 megs, but I doubt this'll speed
<BR>
up Applix much...
