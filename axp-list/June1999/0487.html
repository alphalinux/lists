<P>&nbsp;Let me give you a real example.  I have a stream of compressed data
<BR>
created on a 16-bit machine.  It is a mixture of 8-bit and 16-bit
<BR>
unsigned quantities.  How would you handle it most efficiently?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;I would define a &quot;uint8_t *x&quot; pointer (a &quot;void *x&quot; would be an option
<BR>
here, but the former one allows pointer arithmetics in a portable way) and
<BR>
depending on the current necessity I would use it as is for 8-bit
<BR>
quantities or use &quot;((uint16_s *)&amp;(x))-&gt;v&quot; cast (where &quot;uint16_s&quot; is
<BR>
defined as &quot;typedef struct { uint16_t v __attribute__((packed)); }
<BR>
uint16_s;&quot;) to access 16-bit ones.  As of egcs 1.1 this should inform the
<BR>
compiler, data is potentially unaligned and result in a possibly most
<BR>
efficient code, i.e. a single opcode for machines that do not have any
<BR>
alignment constraints (like i386) or two opcodes for unaligned fetch for
<BR>
machines that do not support unaligned bus accesses (like Alpha or MIPS).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;One can use &quot;uint8_t&quot; fetches with appropriate shifting and ORing (it's
<BR>
still necessary on different-endian machines even though some archs have
<BR>
explicit support for most common endianness convertions) but this wastes a
<BR>
lot of unnecessary cycles. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;If you have any other ideas, please do not hesitate to share them.
