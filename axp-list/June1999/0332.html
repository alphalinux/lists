<P>
I installed Redhat 6.0 without a problem.  I can get it to boot
<BR>
perfectly with the stock kernel, except that the ethernet doesn't work.  I
<BR>
have been trying to recompile the kernel (from the source on the cd) but I
<BR>
can't get the scsi to work.  It says that it finds 0 scsi hosts, saying
<BR>
that I might want to try assigning an irq manually instead of using the
<BR>
automatic setting.  This is a udb - I didn't know that you could assign it
<BR>
an irq manually.
<BR>
<P>I know that it is looking at irq 11, memory address 0x4200000, and when I
<BR>
boot with the stock kernel it finds the device at memory address 0x800000.
<BR>
<P>How do I make this silly machine boot?
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
Tad
