<P>
I am very familiar with Linux on x86, but am completely new to Alpha. I'm
<BR>
guessing there is a FAQ or two I should consult (so feel free to point them
<BR>
out). Here are some of the questions:
<BR>
<P>I have an Alpha sold by Carrera. It originally had NT on it, but it was
<BR>
re-purposed by my company and I have inherited it. I want to install RedHat
<BR>
6.0. I have read some docs and have played with it, but haven't gotten very
<BR>
far (mostly because the documentation for RedHat on Alpha is foreign to me).
<BR>
<P>My primary question is &quot;How do I install RedHat&quot; on it? Additional
<BR>
underlying questions include:
<BR>
&nbsp;* Can I do an FTP installation as with x86 or do I need a CD-ROM?
<BR>
&nbsp;* How do I determine what kind of Alpha I have? I've read about Noname,
<BR>
Cabriolet, Aspin Alpine, EB*, PC*, and XL*, but have no idea how to
<BR>
identify what I have.
<BR>
&nbsp;* How do I determine if I need to upgrade the firmware? (it is currently
<BR>
running
<BR>
4.47-Proto 960508.1138)
<BR>
&nbsp;* What floppies will I need. In addition to the ramdisk.img, I've read
<BR>
about MILO, linload.exe, and fmu.gz.
<BR>
<P>The processor is a 21164 running at 367 MHz (or so the system reports).
<BR>
<P>Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!
<BR>
<P><P>Thanks in advance,
<BR>
Roy
