<P>
I apologize in advance since I am quite positive that some
<BR>
of these questions have arisen already; unfortunately, I haven't
<BR>
followed this list attentively enough lately, and also I don't know
<BR>
where/whether(?) there is a good searchable archive of this list.
<BR>
<P>Just installed RH6.0 on a lx164. Overall things worked out OK, I 
<BR>
do have a workable and internetworked system again (I saw too much
<BR>
crap happen with upgrades from 5.1/5.2 -&gt; 6.0 on i386, so I didn't
<BR>
even attempt this on an alpha...).
<BR>
<P>A number of irritating points remain:
<BR>
<P>I can't remember anymore, but wasn't there some workaround to get
<BR>
the system to install files with a date other than 2015... (I did
<BR>
a find / -name '*' -exec touch {} \; immediately after the
<BR>
install, but there must be something more intelligent; further, this
<BR>
doesn't fix dates on symlinks. (I have two more of these alphas
<BR>
to install...)
<BR>
<P>Anyone noticed that emacs suddenly gives unaligned traps -- I hadn't
<BR>
seen any of those in either RH5.1 or 5.2?  [I have upgraded the
<BR>
base-netkit and traceroute with R.H. new src.rpms, so that is fixed
<BR>
and can't be the reason.]
<BR>
<P>Remembering some traffic on the list, I shut down the X-fontserver
<BR>
and run X-Windows without xfs. Did anyone explore the xfs issues
<BR>
in more details, i.e., is there already a solution. (I wouldn't
<BR>
mind using xfs in our network...)
<BR>
<P>Finally, one of the alphas that needs to be upgraded to RH6.0 is
<BR>
an UX.  Any 'campfire stories' to trade with respect
<BR>
to RH6.0 and the UX?  I had a hell of a time getting it stable
<BR>
under 5.1...
<BR>
<P>Many thanks in advance,
<BR>
<P>Stefan
