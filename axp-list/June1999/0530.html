The original statement I made was 1) source for free, 2) JCK not so free, and 3)
<BR>
distribution not so free.
<BR>
the  issue with the majority of ur correspondence, was ur inability to understand
<BR>
that u cannot do a port if ur not allowed to  modify the '.java' source code.  U
<BR>
apparently misled some folks into believing that I was deliberately altering the
<BR>
core API so I can do an alpha port.  Shame on u.
<BR>
U Apparently did not understand that returning a 64 bit long from a 'c' routine,
<BR>
and passing it to the JVM will truncate as it is stored into an .java int. I'm
<BR>
sorry it took so long into explaining these porting facts to u. May be u can
<BR>
explain why it took so long, as there appears to be no reason at all as to why i
<BR>
should  have bothered explaining at all.
<BR>
<P>As for THIS correspondence that Mr. Sinz has begun, which is a totally different
<BR>
new discussion topic than porting Java onto an alpha.  This particular topic
<BR>
happens to deal with providing future 'alpha' ports to the linux community.
<BR>
<P>I have also signed NDA's.
<BR>
<P>Yes, they can drop the 'commercial' license. Just tell Sun &quot;no thanks&quot;.  Of course
<BR>
that would mean that there wont be any Java/Linux/Ports for the Linux/Intel
<BR>
community. Cant imagine what kinda hell that would make for
<BR>
java-linux-porting@blackdown, as well as for sun. Maybe as a side effect they will
<BR>
bring back the Non-Commercial licenses term back for EVERYONE. Maybe they'll just
<BR>
drop linux.
<BR>
<P>I'd like to think that my posting of the Binaries, as well as the diffs would help
<BR>
bring back the Non-Commercial license, but I just dont think so. There is no
<BR>
requirement that I even post my port to the internet, nor share my diffs with
<BR>
anyone. public/private correspondence between porters regarding java source was to
<BR>
be made by diffs only, and only if they chose to. Again this is just another side
<BR>
issue, that u have brung up - May be to sway from the real issue at hand, which I
<BR>
can only summarize as being &quot;non-commercial licenses for jdk1.2 are dead&quot;. BTW, not
<BR>
that it much matters now, but I did post the diffs to the JDK1.2 sometime in
<BR>
december, 1998.
<BR>
<P>I'd like to think of myself as a public java-linux porter at blackdown ( please
<BR>
note that there is no hyphen between linux &amp; porter ) . I'd also like to believe
<BR>
that when i do a port, I am doing it just for the alpha/linux community.  I'm sorry
<BR>
u didnt understand those points.
<BR>
<P>I'd like all correspondence with porting issues to be made in the public light for
<BR>
public scrutiny and/or ridicule.  Private correspondence just helps to hide
<BR>
pertinent issues, and fallacies in ones argument  Ergo this correspondence will
<BR>
also be made public.  If u wish to stop, then just stop corresponding. I wouldn't
<BR>
mind a single bit.

<P><EM>&gt; All right, this is getting *WAY* old. George, I've been replying to you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; privately to try to keep this from spamming up the list, but you insist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on adding additional lists with every post. No one is impressed with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this tantrum-throwing on your part.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Michael S. points out that you've been invited to join the Blackdown
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; team, and you have declined the invitation, for whatever reason. It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't matter what your reasoning is, as the end result is the same in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any case. Now you're accusing them of hiding behind the NDA they were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; required by Sun to sign. How are they hiding? They have a contractual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obligation to Sun *not* to do full source releases. Java is not and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never has been &quot;open source&quot; - the current source release is only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sort-of &quot;open source&quot;, that is, you have to agree to a license, and part
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the terms of that &quot;Community&quot; license is that you will not share the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; source with anyone who is not also a licensee. Now, anyone can be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; licensee for personal, research and educational purposes. The Blackdown
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; team *can't* &quot;drop the commercial license&quot; as you suggest, but they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *can* still post the diffs, since the diffs are useless without the full
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sun sources - which, again, *anyone* can obtain.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Incidentally, Michael S. comments that you have refused to post your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; diffs for your previous ports. Is that true? Surely you read the clause
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the previous non-commercial source license which states that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *must* post your diffs? And, please don't send another &quot;you don't know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what you're talking about&quot; message to umpteen lists - I've been a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; licensee since 1.1 FCS. And, yes, I *have* read the Blackdown diffs, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well as the full Sun sources.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This whole thread went from &quot;Is it permissible to change the size of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Java int on a given platform?&quot; to &quot;Waaa! See how badly I'm being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mistreated by the evil commercial software company!&quot;. Deal with the fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that since ints are defined to be 32-bit per the Java Language
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Specification, you are not allowed to change that size just because you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have some unknown aversion to using longs where you should.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again, you're implying that Sun and the Blackdown team somehow &quot;owe&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you, but you can't give any *real* examples of why, nor can you give any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *real* examples of why an int *must* be 64-bits. If you *can* show that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a Java int *absolutely MUST* be 64-bits, then file a bug with Sun.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Can we PLEASE just get over this petty (and totally unrelated to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; original issue) garbage?

<EM>&gt; &gt; I'd much perfer that you private porting club become public. Ur hiding behind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the NDA, just makes u appear to be in the marketeering pockets os SUN. This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; can be exemplified by the way that the JDK 1.2 release announcement  was made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; by SUN before any announcements on the normal channels at blackdown.  U'r
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; exclusive sun/java-linux-porting allience, appears to me to be outside of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; linux community ethical standards. I'm sorry but thats how i feel. And the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; blackdown java-linux-porting group has done nothing at all to change this, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; has done quite a bit to re-assure me that NOT Joining was the right thing to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; do.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Can I presume thet the Death of the Non-Commercial Licensing for the JDK 1.2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; was in part because ur private porting group signed a commercial licensing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; agreement with sun.? Or maybe you folks dont realize what u did. I Guess its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; no different that what the movie &quot;BRAVEHEART&quot; depicted when *some* of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; scotish nobility sold out their country to the king of england.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; As for Joining, historically speeking, when the porting efforts was quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; young, I did in fact do a &quot;subscribe java-linux-porting&quot; once. It was reject
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; by Karl Asha, because I didn't provide a piece of code from the JDK source -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to demonstrate that I had aquired a sun license. Some discussion ensued about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the necessisity of this, and chose not to join. group philosophy was quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; different also then.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; offers to Joining only came recently, after many years of doing my porting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; without any assistence by your group. Something was up, only later did I find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; out that your group aquired/signed the  commercial license to port 1.2. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; suppose it was just coincidence, i dont think so  I also suppose having my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; diffs would make your private porting to the 'alpha' fairly easy ( I say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fairly because I do not know if the JCK is neutral with respect to 32/64bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; issues ).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; When I do my alpha ports, I feel that I am doing it for the Alpha Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; community. I'm just not ready to work for Sun guised as a linux porter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; So How about dropping the Sun commercial license in favor of giving everyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in the linux community an equal opportunity at porting.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; gat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Does anyone know how to contact &quot;/.&quot;. I'd like to publish this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; BTW, u do know that NON-COMM licenses for 1.2 has stopped?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Thanks for the encouragement to take the next step. I have tried to refrain in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; doing so. I dont think this next step is what u expected.

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;1) I am not a member of java-linux-porting@blackdown. They are a private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   porting club.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; You have been invited to be part of the effort.  The &quot;private&quot; part
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; comes from the fact that we had to sign NDA/Contracts so that we could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; start working on the JDK 1.2/Java 2 code.  Before that (JDK 1.1.x) you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; were also invited to join and you had also declined.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; You have also declined to post your Alpha DIFFs such that people like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; myself could compile the code for my Alpha CPU optimizations.  (And maybe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; link with Motif rather than LessTif)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;2) I have been porting the Javasoft's non-commercial JDK source for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   number of years.. But just for for alpha/linux.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, and Alpha owners/users are happy that you have done so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; At this point I would say the next step is up to you.  You may join the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; porting group (no cost, just some NDA stuff) and continue to have your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; work be of benefit to all Linux/Alpha users.  Or you can post your diffs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; (which is still legal) and let each interested user download the Sun source
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; and do their own build (yes, this is non-trivial due to the bootstrap
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; requirements, but again, your work would be made available to others)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe someone with a license could even make the compiled port available.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; (Assuming there is someone who has the time and license to do so)
