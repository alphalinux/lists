I believe alphalinux supports up to 2 gigs of ram, which is a limitation
<BR>
thrust upon it by the intel side (i believe, there are probably many more
<BR>
knowledgeable people on here than me who know more on that) The fastest
<BR>
processor is the alpha 21264 at 500mhz. To put it simply the 21264 eats the
<BR>
PIII 500 as an appetizer. As per compaq's site SpecINT95/fp95: 26/49 I'm not
<BR>
sure what the intel numbers are, but they are lower. All I can give is a
<BR>
rough idea, for the quickest machine you are going to want to use an alpha,
<BR>
as for the operating system, that could be the limiting factor. Tru64 (what
<BR>
was Digital Unix) might be a better choice depending on what you want to do,
<BR>
and how much you want to spend.

Subject: Memory and performance with an alpha based Linux box
<BR>
<P><P>I have been assigned with some simulation work which demands a quite
<BR>
powerful computer. And I was wondering if somebody could supply me with
<BR>
some essential information.
<BR>
&nbsp;What is the largest amount of memory an alpha box running Linux can make
<BR>
use of?
<BR>
How quick is the quickest Alpha chip available and how does it compare
<BR>
to the quickest intel can offer (a PIII 550)?
<BR>
<P>(Unfortunately the software I am gona use is not parallelized so I am
<BR>
stuck with a single processor machine)
<BR>
<P>Thanks
