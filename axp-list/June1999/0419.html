<P>
INN from the original inn-2.2-8 package that came with RH6.0 didn't run
<BR>
at all. I have now upgraded to 2.2-9, which basically seems to work.
<BR>
innd is up and I can post articles through nnrpd.
<BR>
<P>inews doesn't do anything, though. &quot;inews -D&quot; looks okay, but when I
<BR>
actually try to post an article, nothing happens. inews exits normally.
<BR>
The article doesn't appear anywhere. It isn't in the regular spool, it
<BR>
isn't in incoming/, it isn't in incoming/bad/. There's no trace of it.
<BR>
There's nothing in the logs either.
<BR>
<P>inews is setgid news, so normal users can't trace it. When I trace it as
<BR>
root with strace(1), I get a SEGV early on, probably still in the libc
<BR>
startup code. (I suspect it is strace that segfaults, rather than
<BR>
inews.)
<BR>
<P>Can anybody out there confirm that inews does(n't) work?
<BR>
