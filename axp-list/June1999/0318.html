<P><EM>&gt; Why are there no netscape binaries for Alpha?
</EM><BR>
<P>I assume you mean Netscape Communicator 4.x.  There are no binaries
<BR>
for this because Netscape didn't port the Communicator components to
<BR>
the Alpha, probably (e.g. Calendar and all that.)  (The Digital Unix
<BR>
version was built with the 32bit translator hack, IIRC.)
<BR>
<P>If you mean Mozilla binaries (of which there are also no binaries)
<BR>
that's because I am the one doing the xptcall port for the Alpha
<BR>
and I had to learn Alpha assembly first.  I believe I now have it 75%
<BR>
done, and should finish it in the next few weeks.  This week though,
<BR>
I'm at JavaOne, so nothing will get done.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I notice there are unsupported binaries for PPC, so maybe if we lobbied
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; netscape we could get them to provide an Alpha binary aswell.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, they probably can't do this, because to do so would mean porting
<BR>
and cleaning up a codebase they aren't working on anymore.  Hang in there;
<BR>
Mozilla 5.0 is on the way, and before long the Alpha should be back in
<BR>
that game.
