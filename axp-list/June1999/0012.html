<EM>&gt; Hello everyone,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What suggestions do you have for backing up RAID disks attached on 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a PC running Linux?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
[stuff removed]
<BR>
<EM>&gt; We attempted to backup the RAID attached on the newly purchased 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux box, over the network to our Sun backup server, but the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; throughput was very slow.  We are now thinking of purchasing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a new tape drive and directly attach it to the Linux box.  
</EM><BR>
<P>This is odd - depending on the Exabyte (and network) you are using, your
<BR>
network should probably be faster than your tape drive (eg my 8700 can stream
<BR>
at between 500k/s and 1M/s, and you should be getting near 1M/s on ordinary old
<BR>
ethernet). How are you actually running the backup - using tar over nfs or
<BR>
something? I would suggest have the sun box do something like 'rsh linuxbox
<BR>
&quot;/sbin/dump 0f - /thefilesystem&quot;' - this used to work nicely for me when
<BR>
running the backups at my last job. Either that or you have a rather faster
<BR>
tape drive than I do :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * Has anyone done this?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * I would appreciate suggestions on how to backup our new RAID disk.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Specifications:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Intel Celeron (Gateway) RedHat Linux 2.2.5-15
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Arena IDERAID5-84 with 32bit PCI Ultra-Wide SCSI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    (will we have to get another SCSI card to attach an 8mm Exabyte
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     tape drive to the PC?)
</EM><BR>
<P>If you do go the separate Exabyte route, it very much depends on how many
<BR>
devices and what cabling you have available for the SCSI card. On the other
<BR>
hand you should be able to pick up an ncr53c810 card which will do the job
<BR>
nicely for not very much. I've no idea what the Arena IDERAID5-84 is so I can't
<BR>
really comment on that one.
<BR>
<P>Another possibility would be to upgrade the network between the two machines in
<BR>
question - given the rather excessive cost of Exabyte drives it might come out
<BR>
cheaper.
<BR>
<P>Either way, I'd probably use 'dump' as the backup software assuming you are
<BR>
using extfs file systems (not sure if it comes as part of redhat; I use debian
<BR>
and it comes with it). Syntax and even output file format is very similar to
<BR>
commercial unix versions (since they are probably all derived from the same
<BR>
Version 6 AT&amp;T unix source - they all had the same rather subtle (and almost
<BR>
completely harmless) bug when I looked a couple of years ago regarding
<BR>
restoring files with a hole at the end).
<BR>
