<P><EM>&gt; I would just like to set some facts straight.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1. Anyone can get the full java 2 source for research, evaluation and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; internal use (which roughly equates to the previous non-commerical license
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before). You couldn't get the full source without this license before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Java 2. SCSL means that you can use the source in this manner without having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to sign a commercial license, the license states that to use the source
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  commercially you need to submit a signed hard copy.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think I said some time ago, 1) source for free
<BR>
<P>Maybe u can elaborate on what &quot;internal use&quot; means. Does this mean that I CAN
<BR>
distribute the binaries to the linux community ? for their internal use ?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2. You need to pass the JCK/TCK tests and sign a commercial license
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to publically release a binary product. The blackdown group have done
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this and it would make things a great deal easier for Sun if other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ports subscribed to the existing license since the legal work involved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is being done for free for linux.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think I said some time ago, 2) JCK not so free ( meaning u gotta give $$ )
<BR>
I think I said some time ago, 3) distribution not so free ( Meaning u gotta give
<BR>
$$).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think someone posted that it costs $2000 for a non-profit, and $5000
<BR>
for-profit.
<BR>
<P>I think the correspondence, as stated by SBB, was that Sun called him.  As of yet,
<BR>
I have not seen a true copy of the licensing, in particular where there are no ($$)
<BR>
charges to be made for this effort.  As of yet I have not seen any documentation
<BR>
where other 'linux' porters can receive the same terms for porting to linux. Ur at
<BR>
sun, maybe u can point the way. May be u can tell me y this wasn't done.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, there isn't any means to distributes binaries to the public,
<BR>
commercially, non-commercially or otherwise.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3. We would love to post alpha/linux diffs if the port can be released
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when it has passed the license. Perhaps even integrate back stuff that could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; benefit all platforms.
</EM><BR>
<P>If I were to take the time and trouble to do a port, posting just the DIFFS is just
<BR>
not enough. What of the binaries.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4. getting java on linux is one part of a forward looking vision. We want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to make it a hard decision when people choose their OS, right? We need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to work together, yes even make some sacrifices which are never easy, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if that helps improve the case for Linux then surely its better to make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; history than be history.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I suppose u really didn't mean this. it sorta suggests that by making it harder for
<BR>
some, u are making it easier for other OS's, and in particular other platforms (
<BR>
like solaris, NT, and intel ) .Maybe while ur sacrificing us linux folks, maybe  u
<BR>
can get SUN to do the same for the WHOLE linux community
<BR>
<P>gat
<BR>
<P>BTW, werent u suppose to tell me about the status of the Non-Commercial licenses
<BR>
for JDK 1.2 ?
