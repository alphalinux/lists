<BR>
<P><P>I am new to Linux but not to Unix or several other OS's.
<BR>
<P>I was encouraged by the Red Hat offer of installation assistance (telephone
<BR>
&amp; email) to give it a try  on an alpha I acquired for this purpose.
<BR>
<P>I expected to need a bit of help to get going so I acquired the Red Hat
<BR>
boxed set of disks and doc's mainly for the support offer.
<BR>
<P>For the benefit of others who may have had these specific problems and a
<BR>
general desire to hold Red Hat accountable for their product support offer,
<BR>
here's my message to their support manager whic is unacknowledged at this
<BR>

Subject:  6.0 Installation Support Experience for Alpha Release
<BR>
<P>I would like to relate my recent experience in contacting telephone support
<BR>
for my Alpha 6.0 Linux installation.
<BR>
<P>After investing several hours in a fresh Linux 6.0 install (repeating the
<BR>
process several times), I registered for support and called the specified
<BR>
telephone number.
<BR>
<P>At that time I had the following problems (all of which I have since
<BR>
resolved by trial and error) :
<BR>
<P>(1) DOS partition - the install process properly created a small partition
<BR>
for a DOS file system but did not format the partition and place the
<BR>
expected files there for a hard disk boot.
<BR>
<P>(2) MILO doc's - the MILO docs indicate an ability to specify a file system
<BR>
type for the LS command. It (avanti) actually doesn't support that command
<BR>
qualifier.
<BR>
<P>(3) Boot file - the install doc's specify booting from the vmlinux.gz file.
<BR>
The install does not create a file by that name.
<BR>
<P>(4) Xconfig - unable to configure for any type of graphical display.
<BR>
<P><P>The support representative informed me that neither he nor anyone else in
<BR>
the group had any knowledge of the Alpha platform and that I might obtain
<BR>
some help from a mailing list.
<BR>
<P>This response disappoints me greatly since, as a new Linux user, I
<BR>
purchased the boxed set mainly because it offered 30 days of telephone
<BR>
installation support...beliving I would need the help.  My LINUX packaging
<BR>
specifically indicates this feature of the delivered product.
<BR>
<P><P>If you consider the nature of the problems cited :
<BR>
<P>the solution to (1) involved using mkfs.msdos to format the partition and
<BR>
copying the required files there. Hardly an Alpha-specific problem.
<BR>
<P>the solution to (3) only required locating the appropirate kernel file
<BR>
(*z.n.n.n) in the /boot directory and telling MILO to use it.
<BR>
<P>(2) would have not been an issue were it not for my efforts at resolving
<BR>
(1). It would have been nice for someone to formally record the doc error
<BR>
for the benefit of others whether or not they knew anything of the Alpha
<BR>
platform.
<BR>
<P>(4) could have been a show-stopper since not being able to use the Linux
<BR>
6.0 system in anything other then text mode would have been a major
<BR>
disappointment. Some help would have been appreciated despite the use of a
<BR>
DEC TGA graphics adapter.
<BR>
<P><P>In any event, I need to understand what level of support I can expect
<BR>
during the 30 day telephone support period and the 90 day email support
<BR>
period.
<BR>
<P>If everyone I reach is going to plead ignorance of the Alpha platform, I
<BR>
might as well have downloaded the kit and doc's off the net and proceeded
<BR>
on my own with $ 80 + still in my pocket.
<BR>
<P>Thank you for your consideration of my comments and look forward to your
<BR>
response.
<BR>
<P>Cameron
