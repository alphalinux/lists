<P>
I'd much perfer that you private porting club become public. Ur hiding behind
<BR>
the NDA, just makes u appear to be in the marketeering pockets os SUN. This
<BR>
can be exemplified by the way that the JDK 1.2 release announcement  was made
<BR>
by SUN before any announcements on the normal channels at blackdown.  U'r
<BR>
exclusive sun/java-linux-porting allience, appears to me to be outside of the
<BR>
linux community ethical standards. I'm sorry but thats how i feel. And the
<BR>
blackdown java-linux-porting group has done nothing at all to change this, but
<BR>
has done quite a bit to re-assure me that NOT Joining was the right thing to
<BR>
do.
<BR>
Can I presume thet the Death of the Non-Commercial Licensing for the JDK 1.2
<BR>
was in part because ur private porting group signed a commercial licensing
<BR>
agreement with sun.? Or maybe you folks dont realize what u did. I Guess its
<BR>
no different that what the movie &quot;BRAVEHEART&quot; depicted when *some* of the
<BR>
scotish nobility sold out their country to the king of england.
<BR>
<P>As for Joining, historically speeking, when the porting efforts was quite
<BR>
young, I did in fact do a &quot;subscribe java-linux-porting&quot; once. It was reject
<BR>
by Karl Asha, because I didn't provide a piece of code from the JDK source -
<BR>
to demonstrate that I had aquired a sun license. Some discussion ensued about
<BR>
the necessisity of this, and chose not to join. group philosophy was quite
<BR>
different also then.
<BR>
<P>offers to Joining only came recently, after many years of doing my porting
<BR>
without any assistence by your group. Something was up, only later did I find
<BR>
out that your group aquired/signed the  commercial license to port 1.2. I
<BR>
suppose it was just coincidence, i dont think so  I also suppose having my
<BR>
diffs would make your private porting to the 'alpha' fairly easy ( I say
<BR>
fairly because I do not know if the JCK is neutral with respect to 32/64bit
<BR>
issues ).
<BR>
<P>When I do my alpha ports, I feel that I am doing it for the Alpha Linux
<BR>
community. I'm just not ready to work for Sun guised as a linux porter.
<BR>
<P>So How about dropping the Sun commercial license in favor of giving everyone
<BR>
in the linux community an equal opportunity at porting.
<BR>
<P>gat
<BR>
<P>Does anyone know how to contact &quot;/.&quot;. I'd like to publish this
<BR>
<P>BTW, u do know that NON-COMM licenses for 1.2 has stopped?
<BR>
Thanks for the encouragement to take the next step. I have tried to refrain in
<BR>
doing so. I dont think this next step is what u expected.

<EM>&gt; &gt;1) I am not a member of java-linux-porting@blackdown. They are a private

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You have been invited to be part of the effort.  The &quot;private&quot; part
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comes from the fact that we had to sign NDA/Contracts so that we could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; start working on the JDK 1.2/Java 2 code.  Before that (JDK 1.1.x) you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were also invited to join and you had also declined.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You have also declined to post your Alpha DIFFs such that people like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; myself could compile the code for my Alpha CPU optimizations.  (And maybe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; link with Motif rather than LessTif)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;2) I have been porting the Javasoft's non-commercial JDK source for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   number of years.. But just for for alpha/linux.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, and Alpha owners/users are happy that you have done so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; At this point I would say the next step is up to you.  You may join the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; porting group (no cost, just some NDA stuff) and continue to have your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work be of benefit to all Linux/Alpha users.  Or you can post your diffs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (which is still legal) and let each interested user download the Sun source
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and do their own build (yes, this is non-trivial due to the bootstrap
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; requirements, but again, your work would be made available to others)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe someone with a license could even make the compiled port available.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Assuming there is someone who has the time and license to do so)
