<P>Does it imply, the stock kernel is not Alpha ready? Oh, man, the
<BR>
2.0.3x horrors come back. One major area, IMHO, wher Linux *sucks*
<BR>
(yes, it is s.u.c.k.s) is the stable kernel release policy. Caching
<BR>
patches for weeks in order to release a mega-patch is asking for an
<BR>
horde of new bugs. I'm really missing the good old days of 1.0.x and
<BR>
1.2.x when patches were released every two-three days. Let the last 
<BR>
stable version will go up to 2.2.1024, but a known patch for a known
<BR>
bug should should not wait for more than 3 days for incorporation.
<BR>
<P>But the worst thing is the orthogonal patch spaces: patches for memory
<BR>
management from Andrea, patches with drivers' fixes from Alan, patches
<BR>
for AXP from you, assorted patches from other people. In order to set
<BR>
up a decent production system (not a cheesy desktop box) I have to
<BR>
keep in mind about dozen of patches for various things and all kinds
<BR>
of precious hints and tips I see in various places (yours, Jay, are
<BR>
more than precious).
<BR>
<P>Sorry for all that bragging - I'm probably just tired. It is extremely 
<BR>
embarrassing to handle monthly reboots of my Alphas just because
<BR>
2.0.35 sucks so badly and it sometimes spits alignment errors in
<BR>
ip_rcv(), and it sometimes hangs the net interface, so I have to
<BR>
bounce it and that is because nobody (including Linus) cared about at
<BR>
least keeping the kernel Alpha-compatible and the patches from Jay
<BR>
never made it in, and yesterday we all saw a magnificent release of
<BR>
2.0.37 - almost half a year if not more after 2.0.36 (despite the fact 
<BR>
the patches were floating around all that time) and now we are
<BR>
probably going to see the same story as with 2.0.30.
<BR>
<P>Sorry,
