<P>
<EM>&gt;&gt;There was some discussion recently of implementing scatter/gather DMA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;in Linux; it would be beneficial on Alpha, and probably also on
</EM><BR>
(excuse
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;my language) Merced.  Maybe we can look forward to this in 2.3?
</EM><BR>
<P>i've never been one to add fuel to a fire (no, really) but
<BR>
there is a patch available from sgi to allow up to 3.8 Gbit of memory.  
<BR>
you can read more and get the patch at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.linux.sgi.com/intel/bigmem/.">http://www.linux.sgi.com/intel/bigmem/.</A>  this is an intel patch, but how
<BR>
hard would it be to port to alpha?
