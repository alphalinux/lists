1) I am not a member of java-linux-porting@blackdown. They are a private porting club.
<BR>
2) I have been porting the Javasoft's non-commercial JDK source for a number of years.. But just for for alpha/linux.
<BR>
3) I have also been a member of java-linux@blackdown for  a number of years.
<BR>
4) the change of anything in '.java', including the lp -&gt;lpr, would violate your notion, sorry , interpretation of the license requirements
<BR>
5) In the land of alpha longs are 64bits as well as address pointers =&gt;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.java
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int    lets_store_a_32_bit_address;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;private native    int wheres_my_window();
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lets_store_a_32_bit_address = wheres_my_window();
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Native .c
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int    wheres_my_window(blah*,blah ){
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long    addr;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;addr = (Window) w;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return(addr);
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
<BR>
This particular example results in the truncation of a returned 64 bit 'c' address, into a 32bit '.java' variable/storage. u can of course change the 'c' routine to return all 64bits, but that will be, eventually, truncated by the jvm to 32bits. In the Land of &quot;OSF/true64&quot; for the Dec Alpha, u can convince the compiler to produce 32bit pointer arithemetic, where long == 32bits. But the currently available linux/alpha compilers a long==pointer==64bits.
<BR>
<P>6) Actually complaining, or presenting my viewpoints does do some good. The whole linux-java community is not just java-linux-porting@blackdown. There are other linux folks out there, of which Sun pays little attention to.  Cant imagine how the java-linux-porting folks got their commercial license, if it weren't for all of those complaining linux/Intel folks - in this forum, and in the Sun's bug-tracking system.
<BR>
<P>7) I didn't ask u to set a reasonable fee, I just threw back ur statement as to what would be a reasonable fee be to port java/linux/alpha. After all sun did say that they support the linux community. I'm just waiting for the support that they had advertised.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now, a change of 'lp' to 'lpr' in a Runtime.exec call is *very*

<EM>&gt; different than changing the size of an int. The license I have for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Java VM source says that none of the .java files are to be modified at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all. I'm sure Apple makes some modifications, too, but again, this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what my license says.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As for stating a reasonable fee, I'm not the person who would be setting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the fees, so I cannot give you a quote of any kind. If the Blackdown
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distribution license doesn't extend to you, then you'd best contact Sun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to find out why (since you say you're porting for Linux on Alpha) and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what can be done to remedy that. Complaining on a mailing list that Sun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't catering to you isn't going to do anyone any good.
