<P>
Briefly I'll stay on topic - thanks for the target of /boot/vmlinuz@; I'll
<BR>
try that out tonight.
<BR>
<P>Staying on topic is boring, however..
<BR>
Please take the following with a large pinch of salt, and remember me if
<BR>
you need theses proofread. 
<BR>
<P>Let he who is without blame cast the first stone.

<P>Sentences end with a full stop.
<BR>
<P><EM>C&gt; However, may I urge you to clean up your english?  There are some poor wording
</EM><BR>
<P>English has an initial capital 'E'. 
<BR>
<P><EM>C&gt; choices made, and syntax errors, and substituting &quot;u&quot; for &quot;you&quot; makes people not
</EM><BR>
<P>'Choices of wording' would be more conventional. However, this is not an
<BR>
error so much as a matter of poor choice of wording...
<BR>
The second independent clause in the sentence looks as if it has been
<BR>
tacked on without being pertinent to the theme.  It is an example;
<BR>
therefore, a stronger and more appropriate conjunction than 'and' is
<BR>
appropriate.  
<BR>
<P><EM>C&gt; want to take you seriously.
</EM><BR>
<P>If 'you' is introduced here, why use the passive voice in the first part
<BR>
of the sentence? One cannot, through one's language, *make* someone not
<BR>
take him/her/sen seriously.  This is nit-picky.
<BR>
<P><EM>C&gt; Just a little advise, no offense intended.
</EM><BR>
<P>The last three words should be a new sentence.
<BR>
Both sentences should also be expanded - such as 'This is just a little
<BR>
advice.' and 'No offense is intended.'
