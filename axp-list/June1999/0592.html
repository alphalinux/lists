<P>
My mind says yea, my heart says no exposition  is really needed to get my
<BR>
act together. Is there a forum, or do u (folks) do this ad-hoc.
<BR>
<P>the -lc was missing, but under RH 5.x, things were correctly/dynamically
<BR>
linked.  In 6.0 I the getimeofday was binded to the wrong routine.  Although
<BR>
the wrong routine was &quot;close enough&quot; to what I wanted in functionality, but
<BR>
it was returning a ( unexpected ) struct of ints, and hence my fetish of
<BR>
ints/longs ( being on an alpha , sizeof() gets to be important )

<EM>&gt; Yes.  That's what will save us from a libc.so.7.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Why should the linker do the 'right thing', and not the dynamic linker.

<EM>&gt; Are you ready for an exposition on symbol versioning?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anyway, you *should* have been linking to libc before, as well as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; every other library you use -- pthreads being a likely candidate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Whether or not things just happened to have been working is immaterial.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not doing so creates an incorrect dependancy graph between the shared
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; libraries, and they might not get initialized in the right order.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but this would be my hell. There is some expectation that if one called
<BR>
gettimeofday(), u get a linkage to gettimeofday() AND not to
<BR>
__gettimeofday_tv32, or __gettimeofday_tv64, or qxxttsss.  I like a one to
<BR>
one relationship, but an onto relationship seems to be leading to severe
<BR>
confusion.
<BR>
<P>I'm not gonna go into the &quot;initialization&quot; part, as that would just add to
<BR>
the confusion.
