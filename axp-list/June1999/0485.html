<P>
(apologies if you've seen this before, I believe I messed up sending it
<BR>
previously, and haven't received it in about 6 hours, so thought I'd try
<BR>
again!)
<BR>
<P><P>The subject line says it all really. However, I'll tell you what I've tried
<BR>
so you needn't repeat the obvious.
<BR>
<P>Firstly I had no problems following the &quot;Installing 5.2 on a Ruffian&quot; web
<BR>
page when I put 5.2 on 6 months ago. I based what I was doing on those
<BR>
instructions. Oh, I'm using Jay's hacked milo from my old 5.2 install days,
<BR>
I assume a working milo is a working milo, and 6.0 shouldn't change that.
<BR>
<P>I successfully installed an out of the box RH 6 by creating the generic and
<BR>
ramdisk image diskettes. Probed and Installed like a dream. Wooo! X up on a
<BR>
Permedia _at_last_, briefly...
<BR>
<P>I then reboot into a Milo console, and try
<BR>
<P>boot sda3:/boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/sda3
<BR>
(my partitions are NT, swap, root, ext&lt;usr, var, usr/local, home, tmp&gt;)
<BR>
<P>The 5.2 instructions were &quot;boot sda?:vmlinux.gz root=/dev/sda?&quot; so I had a few
<BR>
minutes hunting around my disk using milo's ls command, and I thought I'd
<BR>
found the right file, but alas maybe not...
<BR>
<P>I get an unreadable message which disappears under a flood of many screens
<BR>
full of #s, and then it halts with some whiney message about a bad record
<BR>
(bugger, it was 2am at the time I forgot where I put the piece of paper I
<BR>
wrote the message on)
<BR>
<P>I can use ls in milo and stuff, and there were many other files in /boot/,
<BR>
is the vmlinuz@ the correct one to use? 
<BR>
<P>Can I create a boot floppy of an image on the CD, or from FTP/HTTP that
<BR>
will drop me straight into my intended setup? (I used F2 to get a console
<BR>
using the install boot disk, but no mount points or devices were present,
<BR>
so had troubles doing anything at all)
<BR>
<P>Cheers for your patience,
<BR>
Phil
