<EM>&gt; I got ambitious and replaced the failing 2GB drive with a pair of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cheetah's in a raid0 configuration; very sweet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I had to install a new Adaptec adapter since the two cheetah's are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SCSI-2 and have 68 pin connectors, thus the on-board NCR controller
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; couldn't handle them.
</EM><BR>
<P>A sane way of doing things like that is to put RAID controller on
<BR>
a board if you want to boot from the thing but even your configuration
<BR>
can be dealt with.
<BR>
<P>And I would not use Adaptec, but this is just me. :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; After installing the new adapter, the kernel initializes the adaptec
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; driver before the on-board NCR, thus my sda turns into sdc.
</EM><BR>
<P>Controllers are asigned to channels in such order as they are detected in
<BR>
PCI scan - which happens to be reverse in 2.2 kernels than in 2.0 ones.
<BR>
The order was reversed to conform to what BIOSes are usually doing.
<BR>
2.2 kernels also have a boot flag which allow you to switch that order
<BR>
around if you need to.  SCSI drives are asigned consecutive letters in
<BR>
an order they are found - first all drives from a controller 0, then
<BR>
drives from a controller 1 and so on.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What's really wierd is that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never once told Linux about the card.  I just shut the alpha down,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stuck it in, booted it up, and there it was.
</EM><BR>
<P>Eh? And what did you expect?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is there anyway to get into the adaptec BIOS to adjust the settings,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or is this just an intel based feature?
</EM><BR>
<P>I thought that newer Adaptecs allowed an access to their BIOS in a
<BR>
bootup sequence of Alpha.  Pay close attention to messages.  If your
<BR>
controller is still from an old stock there is an 'acu.exe' utility
<BR>
(Adaptec Control Utility), which you can find somewhere on Compaq (DEC)
<BR>
sites.  You run that from firmware loading from a floppy.  A precise
<BR>
URL anyone?  I am not sure if this will help in your particular case,
<BR>
though, as the other controller will be still detected.  If you will
<BR>
recompile a kernel **without** a support for NCR, with Adaptec only,
<BR>
then NCR on board should be left alone.  But distribution kernels,
<BR>
during an upgrade - for example, will still see it.  Setting BIOS on
<BR>
Adaptec will have no relevance to what NCR is doing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The raid array (/dev/md0) isn't being detected during the kernel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; initialization, even though I set the persistent flag in /etc/raidtab.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I had to add raidstart /dev/md0 and mount /raid to rc.local in order
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the array to be mounted.  Is this normal for Alpha/Linux?
</EM><BR>
<P>It is normal for Linux - period.  As you are using mirroring only
<BR>
this is not a big deal.  Separate disks are still valid by themselves
<BR>
and things are ok.  In more complicated setups you are booting into
<BR>
'initrd' ramdisk to set up RAID operations there and you are switching
<BR>
to you &quot;normal&quot; configuration continuing boot afterwards.  See
<BR>
'Documentation' subdirectory in linux kernel source tree for details.
