<EM>&gt; The only command that I can spot to do this, though, is /usr/sbin/vidmode,

<EM>&gt; rdev, which doesn't exist anywhere on my box.

<P>rdev is an Intel specific utility which sets some parameters in boot
<BR>
images. As Alpha boots not the same was on Intel it does not make any
<BR>
sense on it.  'vidmode' in particular,  which happens to be an alias for
<BR>
'rdev -v', marks in a boot image what video mode is desired while booting.
<BR>
VGA firmware on Alpha does not suport switching modes so it is not very
<BR>
useful there.

<EM>&gt; 	* did someone at Red Hat forget to include rdev with the distro (6.0)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	  or did I neglect to install the RPM that has it?
</EM><BR>
<P>It looks like that the only thing they forgot was a removal of a hanging
<BR>
link in /usr/sbin.  Somebody made a minor boo-boo when writing a spec file.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	* is there some other command I can use to tell the console (not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	  running X) to return to text mode?
</EM><BR>
<P>You are in a text mode but from your description it looks like that
<BR>
you lost your console fonts (or maybe they are now black on black).
<BR>
Such accidents were pretty popular few years ago with some broken video
<BR>
cards and two utilties 'savetextmode' and 'restoretextmode' were writen to
<BR>
deal with such accidents.  They are part of 'svgalib' package and I have
<BR>
no idea if they were ever ported to Alpha and it the would work there.
<BR>
Never had a need to try on Alpha.  Maybe X server got more adept in
<BR>
workarounds?  Unfortunately 'restoretextmode' requires that a state of
<BR>
your video was saved on file, with a help of 'savetextmode', __before__
<BR>
you tried to start X server.
<BR>
<P>Maybe you can try to reload your console fonts with 'setfont'?
<BR>
This may even work if you are lucky enough - depending on a state
<BR>
of confusion on your video card.  I gather that 'echo ^O' (that is
<BR>
control-O, one symbol) does not work not mentioning typing, in blind,
<BR>
'reset' followed immediately by ^J (not return) in case you happen
<BR>
to still have raw input?
<BR>

<BR>
<P>In some old times I had an alias 'r' to 'restoretextmode' as it hard
<BR>
to type the later in blind without making any typos. :-)
