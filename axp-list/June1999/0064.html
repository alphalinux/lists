<EM>&gt;&gt; Hi all,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;   Last night I compiled 2.2.7 and 2.2.8 - 2.2.7 and 2.2.8 seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; to be stable on my machine while 2.2.9 is not.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is somewhat strange.  The main difference between 2.2.9 and 2.2.8
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is that 2.2.8 had some unfortunate changes in a buffer code; these 2.2.8
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;changes can hose your file systems in right circumstances and 2.2.9
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;backed them off to the previous state (like in 2.2.7).  These are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;basically all what happened between 2.2.8 and 2.2.9.
</EM><BR>
<P>All I can presume is that there is a rogue pointer somewhere which
<BR>
occasionally
<BR>
goes a miss and lands in some useful data.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I would strongly advise __against__ using 2.2.8.  If you have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;then go back to 2.2.7 although this one had semaphore troubles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on Alpha.  Richard Henderson has various alpha patches for 2.2.9 on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;<A HREF="ftp://ftp.twiddle.net/pub/rth/.">ftp://ftp.twiddle.net/pub/rth/.</A>
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll have a look.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; but configured), Adaptec SCSI (also tried with NCR53c7,8xx but Adaptec
</EM><BR>
still
<BR>
<EM>&gt;                                                    ^^^^^^^
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;                                          This has to be a joke!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is an old driver, basically from times of 1.2 - or earlier - kernels,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;when NCR53c810 was the state of the art, and kept around because somebody
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;may have a very old equipment (in principle NCR53c7xx) which otherwise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will not work.  The driver was not really updated for quite a long while.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Maybe there were some NCR SCSI controllers used, in practice, with alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;boards which would not work with ncr53c8xx driver.  I have yet to see one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;even on quite old machines.  A great majority of these will be happy with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a newer sym53c8xx.  Some of the current NCR based controllers __require__
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the last one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;OTOH if you really have an Adaptec controller, as the above seem to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;imply, then which of NCR drivers you try with it is pretty irrelevant. :-)
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I have an Adaptec card, but also I have an NCR53c815 card hanging around -
<BR>
when the machine
<BR>
started behaving wierdly I thought it would be a good idea to swap the SCSI
<BR>
cards and
<BR>
see if it was SCSI/driver related.  Interestingly the first time I booted
<BR>
it worked
<BR>
fine, the second time and subsequently however AlphaBIOS hung while
<BR>
initialising
<BR>
the NCR card.
