<P><EM>&gt; I dropped out of reading the &quot;bashing&quot; thread of messages a while ago but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just dropped in to see the last few postings.
</EM><BR>
<P>I did something similar, and I have until now resisted adding to what is a
<BR>
pointless flamefest.  IMHO, blame is assignable to both sides.  The reason
<BR>
I'm writing is to specifically address some of Alvin's points.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I opened the licence agreement with the 1.2 jdk and was a little supprised
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by what I read.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have not done this, but I am a Java developer and I have been following Sun's
<BR>
position relatively closely, so maybe I can shed some light on this.  I assume
<BR>
throughout that you are speaking of the Sun Community Source License (SCSL).
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; The first is for &quot;internal use only&quot; and implys that I cannot use this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software for anything other than evaluation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The second loosens that a little and says that I can develop and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distribute code that has been developed with the JDK, but only if I do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; create any classes. 
</EM><BR>
<P>My understanding is that both points are correct.  The whole reason Sun created
<BR>
the SCSL was to address industry concerns that Sun was not being flexible
<BR>
enough in its managing of the standard.
<BR>
<P>Sun's dilemma was to allow interested parties access to the source while not
<BR>
allowing the standard to fragment (or in other words, keep control of it.)
<BR>
If they released it under an actual open-source license, someone else could
<BR>
add their custom changes and market it as an actual product.
<BR>
<P>Now, someone could do this anyway, with a clean-room implementation (and in
<BR>
fact Microsoft HAS, which is why Sun is suing them.)  But at least Sun doesn't
<BR>
have to help them out in competing by handing over the Sun JDK as a starting
<BR>
point.
<BR>
<P>In reality, the SCSL grants nothing.  Sun owns the Java standard and standards
<BR>
process regardless of the status of their particular JDK implementation, so
<BR>
even if they HAD released the JDK under, say, the GPL, anyone who modified it
<BR>
still couldn't market it as Java, but only as Java-derived.  The SCSL works
<BR>
the same way the original AT&amp;T Unix license to universities did:  let people
<BR>
see it, play with it, maybe improve it, while not letting them usurp it.  If
<BR>
you want to actually market your changes, you have to pass Sun's JCK tests to
<BR>
make sure you're not usurping the standard.
<BR>
<P>This is the reason Uncle George doesn't like it, and it's a perfectly valid
<BR>
complaint, especially since you have to pay to license the JCK.  This fee is
<BR>
precisely to make sure that folks like Uncle George can't release a JDK:  Sun
<BR>
wants to make sure that only &quot;serious&quot; parties (i.e. companies with $$) can
<BR>
release a JDK.  With the SCSL, Sun decided they didn't need the Non-Commercial
<BR>
License anymore and dropped it.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, some people don't care about Java source, and only care
<BR>
that there's a JDK for their platform.  This is the blackdown.org
<BR>
philosophy.  I'm sure they'd opt for an open-source license if they could, but
<BR>
they can't so they settle for the restrictions of the SCSL, especially since
<BR>
Sun licensed them the JCK for free (which is Sun's &quot;support&quot; of the blackdown
<BR>
project.)  Having a closed-source JDK is better than no JDK in their eyes,
<BR>
which is also a perfectly valid point.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Off hand this would seen to be a restrictive licence and leads me to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe that dispite sun's hype this is a closed standard.
</EM><BR>
<P>Without a doubt.  Sun touts the Java Community Process which they created to
<BR>
expedite the creation and functioning of working groups to add standard
<BR>
extensions to the language, and it works reasonably well.  It is not, however,
<BR>
open:  it is totally managed by Sun, though the content of the extensions is
<BR>
a consensus of a group of experts who may not be Sun employees.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; At the end of the day I wonder if it would not be beter to push the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; develpment of an Open Source, FSF licenced version of the JDK for linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and tell sun &quot;so long and thanks for all the fish&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>...and here's where I get back on topic for this list. :)  If you want a
<BR>
truly free JDK for the Alpha, you want either Kaffe or Japhar.  Kaffe seems
<BR>
to be further along than Japhar.  (Does Japhar even run at all on the Alpha?
<BR>
I haven't played with it.)
<BR>
<P>Some people don't like Kaffe, though, since the license holder is Transvirtual,
<BR>
which also licenses Kaffe under a proprietary commercial license.  In fact,
<BR>
there are effectively two Kaffe codebases:  the GPL version and the
<BR>
Transvirtual version.  Transvirtual keeps the two trees strictly separate,
<BR>
so the noise you hear about Microsoft paying Transvirtual to make proprietary
<BR>
MS extensions to Kaffe does *not* affect the GPL version of the code.  You
<BR>
can contribute to the GPL version without agreeing to assign your code over to
<BR>
Transvirtual for use in their product.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, Kaffe is not as far along on the Alpha as it is on Intel.  The
<BR>
JIT does not work on the Alpha, and a few other things need work.  Still,
<BR>
progress is being made.  I do use Kaffe as the JVM for the Servlet engine I
<BR>
have running on my home machine, so it does run, it's just not blazing fast.
<BR>
<P><P><P>On a different note, I was at JavaOne and had the opportunity to spend a few
<BR>
minutes at the Compaq booth, where they were touting the high-performance
<BR>
64-bit Java environment they inherited from Digital (AKA, of course, as the
<BR>
JDK for Digital Unix.)
<BR>
<P>I asked if, in light of the CPML and compiler releases, we could expect to
<BR>
see this JDK eventually released for Linux.  I was told that that would be
<BR>
the logical progression of events, but that there are currently no efforts
<BR>
underway toward that goal.  So, maybe (probably?) someday, but not soon.
<BR>
<P><P><P>Anyway, I hope this was useful.  Sorry if it was offtopic, and of course
<BR>
everything herein is IMHO, and according to my understanding. :)
