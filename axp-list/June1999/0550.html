<P>
I have an XLT-300 that's been running well for about a couple years
<BR>
now but recently one of it's drives has started failing.  It's running
<BR>
RH6.0, stock kernel.
<BR>
<P>I got ambitious and replaced the failing 2GB drive with a pair of
<BR>
cheetah's in a raid0 configuration; very sweet.
<BR>
<P>I had to install a new Adaptec adapter since the two cheetah's are
<BR>
SCSI-2 and have 68 pin connectors, thus the on-board NCR controller
<BR>
couldn't handle them.
<BR>
<P>I ran into the following issues:
<BR>
<P>After installing the new adapter, the kernel initializes the adaptec
<BR>
driver before the on-board NCR, thus my sda turns into sdc.  I'm able
<BR>
to work around this fairly easily, but it is annoying.  Does anyone
<BR>
know of any way to work around this?  What's really wierd is that I
<BR>
never once told Linux about the card.  I just shut the alpha down,
<BR>
stuck it in, booted it up, and there it was.
<BR>
<P>Is there anyway to get into the adaptec BIOS to adjust the settings,
<BR>
or is this just an intel based feature?
<BR>
<P>The raid array (/dev/md0) isn't being detected during the kernel
<BR>
initialization, even though I set the persistent flag in /etc/raidtab.
<BR>
I had to add raidstart /dev/md0 and mount /raid to rc.local in order
<BR>
for the array to be mounted.  Is this normal for Alpha/Linux?
<BR>
<P>BTW: Is there a place you can get replacement keys for alpha cases?  I
<BR>
lost my key when I moved and ended up drilling out the lock just to
<BR>
get the case open; not for the fient of heart.
<BR>
