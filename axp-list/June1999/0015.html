<EM>&gt; &gt; Hello everyone,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; What suggestions do you have for backing up RAID disks attached on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a PC running Linux?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [stuff removed]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; We attempted to backup the RAID attached on the newly purchased
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Linux box, over the network to our Sun backup server, but the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; throughput was very slow.  We are now thinking of purchasing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a new tape drive and directly attach it to the Linux box.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is odd - depending on the Exabyte (and network) you are using, your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; network should probably be faster than your tape drive (eg my 8700 can stream
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at between 500k/s and 1M/s, and you should be getting near 1M/s on ordinary old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ethernet). How are you actually running the backup - using tar over nfs or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something? I would suggest have the sun box do something like 'rsh linuxbox
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;/sbin/dump 0f - /thefilesystem&quot;' - this used to work nicely for me when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; running the backups at my last job. Either that or you have a rather faster
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tape drive than I do :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I use rsh and have no troubles saturating my Eliant/DLT4000/DLT7000
<BR>
using 100Mb Enet. So it works if you have reasonable networking.
<BR>
I can also run between my AIX boxes and Linux without trouble.
<BR>
<P>Keep in mind older Exabytes only go 250-500KB/sec. Eliants go from
<BR>
500-1500KB/sec, and the new ones are around 2-3MB/sec, assuming you
<BR>
use the new tapes. (assumes no compression since my data doesn't
<BR>
compress)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; * Has anyone done this?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; * I would appreciate suggestions on how to backup our new RAID disk.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Specifications:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    Intel Celeron (Gateway) RedHat Linux 2.2.5-15
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    Arena IDERAID5-84 with 32bit PCI Ultra-Wide SCSI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    (will we have to get another SCSI card to attach an 8mm Exabyte
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     tape drive to the PC?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Just to be clear. This is an Alpha Linux list, not Intel but your
<BR>
question is relevant on Alpha's also. 
<BR>
Why are you using the term IDE and SCSI in the same sentence? 
<BR>
They're different technologies. If you have IDE disks, you'll 
<BR>
need a SCSI card to attach an Exabyte, at least I've never 
<BR>
seen an IDE Exabyte.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Either way, I'd probably use 'dump' as the backup software assuming you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using extfs file systems (not sure if it comes as part of redhat; I use debian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and it comes with it). Syntax and even output file format is very similar to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; commercial unix versions (since they are probably all derived from the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Version 6 AT&amp;T unix source - they all had the same rather subtle (and almost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; completely harmless) bug when I looked a couple of years ago regarding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; restoring files with a hole at the end).
</EM><BR>
<P>dump comes with RH6.0 also. Use whatever you've been using if
<BR>
it does the job for you. With Intel Linux you also have other
<BR>
choices if you get the boxed version. And, whatever you do,
<BR>
try to keep your tape block sizes reasonably large, 10KB or
<BR>
more. My preference is at least 64KB.
