Hi Charles,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Excel 97 import is dodgy at best.  On my test file, basically a copy of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one of my typical data spreadsheets, it took a *long* time to import the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; file - on the order of 5+ minutes of waiting before I could do anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with it.  This sheet had five &quot;plain data&quot; worksheets (no calculations),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a calculation sheet, and two chart sheets.  The charts were scatterplots
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with lines but no markers, composed of five series with approximately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1000 data points each.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd love to get a copy of this file (send via private e-mail) that we can
<BR>
take a look at, pass on to our filters developers, etc.  We continue to be
<BR>
working to improve our filters, so any more data points (pun intended :)
<BR>
can only help.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now a question - has anyone else noticed Applix's sluggishness?  
</EM><BR>
<P>I noticed the Alpha's sluggishness in general during development, and I
<BR>
somewhat suspect the compiler as being less than optimal at this point in
<BR>
time -- I am comparing performance with Applixware running on a Linux/Intel
<BR>
box.  But nothing like you've mentioned.  Still, I'll pass on the word to
<BR>
our spreadsheet developers so they can try to attack the issues you've
<BR>
mentioned.
<BR>
<P>Eric
