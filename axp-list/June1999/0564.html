<P>
<EM>&gt; They have released specs?  Do you have a URL?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am working on a Riva framebuffer driver for the kernel, and would love
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to get my hands on the specs.
</EM><BR>
<P>There I go putting my foot in my mouth. They released the source code
<BR>
for their drivers on all platforms. I thought that releasing the drivers
<BR>
also meant releasing the specs, makes sense but that's not the case.
<BR>
Sorry about that. 
<BR>
<P>Though you could look at the driver code for the windows drivers and 
<BR>
figure out how it behaves. The driver is a probabably written in C &amp; ASM
<BR>
so given such a low level interface you could figure out exactly how the
<BR>
card works and use that information to aid in your framebuffer work.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; In any case, you will not be able to boot with a Riva as your primary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; card because has 32-bit instructions in its BIOS, and I don't think the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BIOS emulator built into the Alphas will handle that.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm, So say what style bios do most other cards have? 16 bit? I
<BR>
wouldn't underestimate the capibility of the x86 emulation of the
<BR>
AlphaBios. if it currently doesn't work I bet that can be fixed. You
<BR>
won't know until you try. 
<BR>
<P><P>The location for the source code is.
