&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, my trusty UDB has finally called it quits and died on me.
<BR>
Yes, I have tried everything imaginable (and then some) to bring it back
<BR>
to life, including new CMOS battery, fans, power connector cleaning, and
<BR>
even the failsafe floppy load. All I get is two flashes from the SROM led
<BR>
before and after the floppy load, never any picture on the monitor, which
<BR>
the the UDB manual, means that machine is dead (supposed to return to
<BR>
Digital for repair...).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a nice Alpha XLT366 being used as a file/web/db/network
<BR>
server, but I need a lower end (inexpensive) Alpha for testing and porting
<BR>
of software to Alpha/Linux. Last time I tried that with my XLT, I managed
<BR>
to mess up the entire installation and had to restore from tape. Not a
<BR>
good thing to happen to a server my network of Linux boxes depend on for 
<BR>
home directories, etc... :(
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I have been looking around for an AS200 or other such
<BR>
machine for sale, used probably, and have not been having much luck. Most
<BR>
references/leads are very old and turn up nothing. I would prefer to get a
<BR>
stripped machine as I already have RAM, HD, etc..., just need a board,
<BR>
processor and case.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, where are some good place to go looking for said machines? I
<BR>
am not interested in another UDB (one was enough!), and I have been
<BR>
keeping an eye on Ebay (and other such sites), but they only have the big
<BR>
alphas or more UDBs. :( Any help in this would be greatly appreciated.
<BR>
Thanks.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS. I would check the archives for this list, but RedHat seems to
<BR>
have list archives down (again?) for overhaul....
