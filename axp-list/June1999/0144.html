<P><EM>&gt; I bought applix to use on a 166/UDB with 96MB running 5.2 and 2.0.36, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have since upgraded to a 600Mhz 21164 with 128MB running RH-6.0 and it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; works well.
</EM><BR>
<P>I suspect it *would* work well on a 600 MHz 21164.  :)  Have you tried plotting
<BR>
large (5000 point or so) datasets on the UDB, as a point of comparison?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've run it in 8, 16 and 32 bit modes with no problems running on TGA,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; S3-Virge DX and S3-Trio64.
</EM><BR>
<P>That was based on the warnings in the release notes.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've not noticed any problems with my systems, maybe your X server could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do with an upgrade.  You might also be better off using the SVGA server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rather than the S3V for your video card, it only supports 16 bit but it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more stable.
</EM><BR>
<P>Heh.  Stability is the precise reason I was using the S3V server *instead* of
<BR>
the SVGA server.  The SVGA server and neither of my virge cards get along very
<BR>
well, unfortunately.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Slow machine, struggle to untangle the mess that is M$ Excel format.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll forgive it for being slow to import a file.  My main beef with this
<BR>
program is what happens *afterwards*.  I'm also a little worried about
<BR>
importing charts *out* agaib, since that's something I'll actually have to do
<BR>
later.  At least the numerical values in the sheets appear to stay intact.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Word97 docs come in pretty well all things considered.
</EM><BR>
<P>Like I said, I've really only tried the spreadsheet.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm not sure what the problem is, my UDB didn't do too badly running
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Applix, it may be that you're suffering with swapping though, have a look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at what free says.
</EM><BR>
<P>Could it be that the charting module simply doesn't deal well with large
<BR>
datasets?  Swapping isn't an issue here (I checked *that* before my last mail
<BR>
:) ).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Definitely sounds like swapping, it should never be that slow.  Maybe you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should try doing something smaller until you get the hang of it.
</EM><BR>
<P>That *was* one of the smaller datasets. ;)  Like I said, using a template gets
<BR>
me past most of the &quot;step by step&quot; pain, but Applix's performance is nowhere
<BR>
near the level of MS Excel 97.  It seems CPU-bound, by the way, when it's
<BR>
drawing the charts, though no swapping is occuring.  I'm still going to try a
<BR>
different video card/X server to see if it's something peculiar with my setup. 
<BR>
Maybe it's an X thing.
<BR>
<P>In this particular instance, it would benefit greatly if, during the redraw of
<BR>
the mini graph, you could still type into the text entry boxes and finish your
<BR>
data entry while it's drawing.  Even if it makes the plot take *longer* to come
<BR>
up, the *work* gets done faster.  Also, on the small preview plots, do all 5000
<BR>
points and markers really need to be drawn?  I suspect Excel here isn't drawing
<BR>
all 5000 for the preview plot (it doesn't need to - it's just a preview) and is
<BR>
getting a speed boost here.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Just have a look to see what else the machine is doing when you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; running your spreadsheets.  Applix is pretty heavy, but I used to use the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Intel version on a 486/33 with 20MB and it was useable and 4.4.1 on my old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; UDB was pretty snappy.
</EM><BR>
<P>The unfortunate problem is that on a 233 MHz Alpha with 80 megs of RAM, it
<BR>
seems more sluggish than on a new comparison machine - a 486 DX2/66 with 16
<BR>
megs running Windows 95 and Office 97.  Ouch.  (The 16 meg Windows boxes do hit
<BR>
swap hell occasionally - such as when that openGL screensaver kicks in), but
<BR>
they're still clocking better spreadsheet performance).  Other apps running
<BR>
were Apache (mostly idle), ftpd (idle for the time I was using Applix), and some
<BR>
Windowmaker dock apps (wmmon, wmweather, wmgrabimage, wmmail, etc.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Personally I am grateful that I have applix,
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, but I think we want the best product we can have.  This is particularly
<BR>
important when as of yet we don't really have any other choice on the Alpha
<BR>
platform.  At least on my Celeron I can run Star Office (or WP8 for word
<BR>
processing) as well as Applix.  This isn't an &quot;Applix sucks&quot; type of post - I'm
<BR>
just concerned that it's not seeming to measure up to Excel on &quot;lesser&quot;
<BR>
machines on my datasets.
<BR>
<P>I'm still going to try the graphics card swap.  Even if it doens't cure the
<BR>
speed issues, it should get rid of those errant grid lines.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; least I can now submit papers to journals which refuse anything non-M$
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; although I would rather do them in LaTeX but thats life.  Keeps me off the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lone PC we have around here at any rate!
</EM><BR>
<P>It's a good thing that historically exporting has worked better than importing.
<BR>
;)
