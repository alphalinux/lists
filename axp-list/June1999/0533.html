Hmmm while we are on the subject of printing and Ghostscript in RH6.0... I
<BR>
have been unable to get pdf2ps to generate anything that my LJ4
<BR>
understands. The postscript views fine in gv, but when I send it to the
<BR>
printer it tells me there is an error in the &quot;setpagedevice&quot; command.
<BR>
Unfortunately I have no postscript experience and can't determine what is 
<BR>
wrong. (When you delete the line it just doesn't work - okay it was a
<BR>
dumb idea)
<BR>
<P>Anyway, there was an errata list for this version of GS which appeared to 
<BR>
hint at this problem, and a new version announced.. ghostscript-5.50-3. It
<BR>
compiled straight off from the RPM (amazing) and I tried to convert my,
<BR>
now standard, pdf file to ps. Did it work? 
<BR>
<P>It did not.
<BR>
<P>However, I have managed to get pcl conversion working O.K. So I can now
<BR>
print this document to the printer in pcl. Maybe this shows that some
<BR>
bits work, but it clearly indicates that there are quite a few bugs in the
<BR>
current versions.
<BR>
<P>Of course this is probably out of place on this list as I guess it is a
<BR>
cross-platform problem.
<BR>
<P>Do we have any GS experts in the audience?
<BR>
<P>Phil.
