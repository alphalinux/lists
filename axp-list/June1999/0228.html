<P>
<EM>&gt;Just wondering if anyone tried 2.2.9-ac5 in a heavy loaded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;single CPU Alpha yet? Does it need additional patches  to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be more stable?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I tried 2.2.9-ac4 and it froze up on me, twice in a day. After
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I went back to 2.2.5, things seem more stable and did not experience
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any lock up so far (up for 20 hours now under moderate load.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But ypbind-mt does not work so well in 2.2.5, sometimes cannot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;get user info under heavy load.
</EM><BR>
<P>Can you describe exactly what is happening with 2.2.9-ac4? The reason I
<BR>
ask is that I've found 2.2.9 (ac1,ac2,ac3, with and without d-axp-229 and
<BR>
others) to be very unstable. I was testing a machine at work and it would
<BR>
run between 5 minutes and 1/2 an hour and then it would lock solid. I
<BR>
should say that I was testing a new machine so I was keeping the load
<BR>
between 3 and 5. No OOPS, no info in syslog. The only thing that functioned was the ALT-SYSRQ
<BR>
keys. I went back to 2.2.5 and all was fine, I think that 2.2.7 was also
<BR>
fairly reliable.
