<EM>&gt; If you don't set up the network, you don't have a say in naming the

<EM>&gt; system.  I know it is in a file in /etc/ but a beginner would not.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you do not set up your networking, even if only with loopback and
<BR>
dummy interfaces, then your X-windows will have assorted problems.
<BR>
Unix/Linux computers simply expect to have some networking up even
<BR>
if this is a lone machine.
<BR>
<P>SuSE distribution tries to be helpful in that to newbies by silently
<BR>
and automatically bringing up &quot;dummy&quot; interface during an installation.
<BR>
As a result later various smb protocol related lists and newsgroups
<BR>
are full of wailings &quot;my Samba does not work&quot;.  Turns out that all SMB
<BR>
broadcast packets end up on dummy and things are not happy.  Also various
<BR>
&quot;dial-on-demand&quot; schemes have troubles.  One way or another you
<BR>
have to look at this manual at some moment, I am afraid.  There are
<BR>
so many variations in a setup that it is really hard to predict them
<BR>
all and somebody is going to loose.  Maybe some AI project one day?
<BR>
I am really serious here.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I am trying to untar an archive I set up before wiping my 5.1 install.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tar is about as slow as tar, mixed with molasses, with a gravel aggregate,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sliding down a one degree incline. I still haven't figured out why.
</EM><BR>
<P>I can guess the most likely reason.  You did not bother to configure your
<BR>
/etc/nsswitch.conf to reflect reality.  This is an example where Red Hat
<BR>
**tried** to be helpful and they put NIS entries in because you may run
<BR>
on NIS setup.  Maybe they figured that it easier to edit these entries
<BR>
out than add them without looking at docs or maybe _they_ simply have NIS
<BR>
and copied standard config file?  As a result tar attempts to check first
<BR>
ownership of an every item in an archive with your NIS server.  If the
<BR>
later does not exist then responses have to timeout and you see what
<BR>
you see.  This was not happening with older glibc versions; most likely
<BR>
a bug in these versions which was to your advantage on a particular setup.
<BR>
<P>If you do not edit your /etc/nsswitch.conf then you will see similar
<BR>
effects in many other places.
