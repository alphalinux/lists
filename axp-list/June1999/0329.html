I've seen the same thing, but it looks like dump works (or at least it
<BR>
acts like it works, without restore it is hard to tell for sure).
<BR>
<P>I've noticed one other strange thing I haven't accounted for with dump and
<BR>
tar (both run through amanda 2.4.1p1):  my incremental dumps seem to be
<BR>
almost as big as a full dump, as if something is modifying the inode change
<BR>
time on a lot of files.  I haven't been able to find anything that might be
<BR>
doing this, though, and on an i386 RedHat 6.0 system everything (including
<BR>
restore) seems to work as expected.  Has anyone else seen this?
<BR>
