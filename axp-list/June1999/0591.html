Thanks,
<BR>
I think that their ( blackdown's ) track record with respect to ALPHA just
<BR>
doesn't exist. This is by their own admission. as for performance, a JIT just
<BR>
doesn't exist yet, except that maybe from Compaq/digital ( for which, i for
<BR>
one, was unable to get a copy ) . I think u'd have better luck with digitals
<BR>
version of the JDK on the ALPHA/NT.  I'd offer u mine, but I lost track of it
<BR>
so long ago. And since u say that as a manager, i would think that these
<BR>
reality reminders would be very important considerations.
<BR>
<P>It wasn't too hard to port an Alpha/NT. But Now my C++ compiler is way outta
<BR>
date, with no real expectation of getting a newer or current copy on the open
<BR>
market. I'm just not ready to call that 800 number into redmond to see how much
<BR>
it really costs :-/
<BR>
<P>As for dropping Alpha/NT/workstations - as last remembrance, it was rumored
<BR>
that Compaq was quietly telling the vars to sell off current inventory. This
<BR>
was mentioned on the axp-list. I think it was also published - but dont know
<BR>
for sure. Anybody on the Axp-list can help me or this guy out with whats
<BR>
currently happening with Alpha NT ?
<BR>
<P>Glad to hear that u are the ( probably ) largest var. May be u can tell me what
<BR>
the value added software is.  Maybe point me to the Web pages of the products,
<BR>
and/or descriptions of why the Alpha/NT is the choice architecture for your
<BR>
organization. Love to hear success stories regarding the Alpha/Nt.. Look
<BR>
forward to hearing it.

<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I think u are a little outta date. Compaq appears to be on the way of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dropping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Alpha/NT. I also got tired of asking various vendors what other packages
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are avail
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that can run on the alpha .  u just cant imagine how hard it is to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'nt' device
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; drivers that will work on the alpha. Its exceedingly hard to obtain a copy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; MSc++ on the open market. This is not ur fault, or problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; BTW, u'll find the alpha resellers to be a little more realistic, and savy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; comes to selling alpha computers. I (usually) find them more intellegent,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of the 'intel centric' vendors.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As a software R&amp;D manager at a Fortune 50 company that is buying Alpha boxes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at an amazing rate (we are probably Compaq/Digital's largest Alpha VAR), I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can tell you authoritatively that Compaq is NOT going to be dropping either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha or Alpha/NT.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I met with the Alpha team at JavaOne and am comfortable with what they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doing and where they are going. Their stated goal for the Alpha ports of 1.2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is to have the very fastest Java available on any platform. In talking to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them about their porting strategy and the tricks they are using, I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they will meet their goals.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Just thought I would fill you in from the point of view of someone leading a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; significant Alpha/NT based effort.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Peace,
</EM><BR>
