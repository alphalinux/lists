<EM>&gt; &gt; I've been exploring migration over to linux from Digital UNIX. Does linux

<EM>&gt; &gt; have something analagous to Digital UNIX's mfs (Memory File System)? Our

<EM>&gt; &gt; application makes use of this to avoid I/O and we need something similar.

<P>Actually, I looked into this before some time ago, and the answer is no, if I
<BR>
read what you are doing correctly.  SunOS (and presumably Solaris) have a
<BR>
similar filesystem called &quot;tmpfs&quot;, which isn't really a filesystem, but is a
<BR>
virtual filesystem that lives solely in memory.  The thing about it that's
<BR>
different from Linux's ramdisk, is that (under SunOS) it shares space with
<BR>
swap.  Linux's ramdisk doesn't work this way.  Typically /tmp is mounted with
<BR>
this filesystem type so it's cleared when the system reboots, and running out
<BR>
of /tmp space also could crash your machine depending on how well it handles
<BR>
running out of swap.  Naturally, /tmp can also be swapped to disk (since it is
<BR>
swap), and can be resized with swapon and swapoff.  There was a project to do
<BR>
this under Linux (called swapfs, I think) but it has since been abandoned.
<BR>
I know of no efforts to resurrect it.
