<EM>&gt; &gt; Why are there no netscape binaries for Alpha?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	There are aplenty of 32 vs. 64-bit issues in Netscape source,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	and gcc does not support &quot;-taso&quot; compilation as DEC CC does.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	(with 32-bit pointer addresses..)  Essentially the initial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	Mozilla ( = Netscape 4.0 ) source did show that it contains
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	*a lot* of code with implied assumption that pointers are 32-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	bit objects.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	During the Mozilla effort, a lot of these things have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	fixed, and therefore the Mozilla works (to a degree) at Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<P>Let me also vigorously agree with the above statements. I have been
<BR>
successfully building Mozilla on a Linux/Alpha almost on a daily basis
<BR>
since the last couple of weeks. While it certainly is still
<BR>
work-in-progress and core dumps every once in a while, several of the
<BR>
components are working rather nicely (If only we could fix it to work
<BR>
over http proxies.... hopefully soon, I guess...).
<BR>
<P>If each one who desires a browser (and cares to build one) starts
<BR>
running Mozilla, Linux/Alpha will have one less application package
<BR>
whose availability is &quot;roumored&quot; to be non-existant !! It will
<BR>
certainly increase the user base and clean bugs :-) There is always
<BR>
Amaya, though.
<BR>
<P>Just my 2 cents worth thoughts and experiences,
