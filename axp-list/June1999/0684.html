<EM>&gt;	Well, my trusty UDB has finally called it quits and died on me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yes, I have tried everything imaginable (and then some) to bring it back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to life, including new CMOS battery, fans, power connector cleaning, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;even the failsafe floppy load. All I get is two flashes from the SROM led
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;before and after the floppy load, never any picture on the monitor, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the the UDB manual, means that machine is dead (supposed to return to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Digital for repair...).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	I have a nice Alpha XLT366 being used as a file/web/db/network
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;server, but I need a lower end (inexpensive) Alpha for testing and porting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of software to Alpha/Linux. Last time I tried that with my XLT, I managed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to mess up the entire installation and had to restore from tape. Not a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;good thing to happen to a server my network of Linux boxes depend on for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;home directories, etc... :(
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	Anyway, I have been looking around for an AS200 or other such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;machine for sale, used probably, and have not been having much luck. Most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;references/leads are very old and turn up nothing. I would prefer to get a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stripped machine as I already have RAM, HD, etc..., just need a board,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;processor and case.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	So, where are some good place to go looking for said machines? I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;am not interested in another UDB (one was enough!), and I have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;keeping an eye on Ebay (and other such sites), but they only have the big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;alphas or more UDBs. :( Any help in this would be greatly appreciated.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Thanks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	PS. I would check the archives for this list, but RedHat seems to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have list archives down (again?) for overhaul....
</EM><BR>
<P>Computer Surplus Outlet is selling 275 Mhz alpha motherboard (21064 I
<BR>
believe) with 300 watt PS for $269.. You might want to build yourself a box
<BR>
with that... I would assume that all you need is a case and FD, and you can
<BR>
take the rest of your stuff from your multia.. Just a suggestion.
