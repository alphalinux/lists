<EM>&gt;Hmm.  I just visited www.redhat.com and checked out their catalog (since
</EM><BR>
their
<BR>
<EM>&gt;commerce system is back up.)  I noticed several absences that trouble me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;First, there is apparently not (as of right now anyway) a &quot;Variety Pack&quot;
</EM><BR>
for 6.0.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;I suppose this isn't unreasonable considering that it was probably not a huge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;volume seller, but it's a nuisance to me since I actually do have Intel,
</EM><BR>
Alpha,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;and SPARC boxen I want it installed on.  Since the price has also gone up to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;$80, this means that I'm going to have to shell out $240(!) if I want
</EM><BR>
&quot;official&quot;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;discs for all three.  Compare that to the $40 for RH 5.2 Variety Pack.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why buy the official one then? Just get your friendly local person with a
<BR>
CD Writer
<BR>
to write you a GPL version.
<BR>
<P>I bought RH5.1/Alpha, had problems registering it and didn't get anything in
<BR>
the way of help as I remember.
<BR>
<P>I won't be buying the official version again.
