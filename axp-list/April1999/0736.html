Hmm.  I just visited www.redhat.com and checked out their catalog (since their
<BR>
commerce system is back up.)  I noticed several absences that trouble me.
<BR>
<P>First, there is apparently not (as of right now anyway) a &quot;Variety Pack&quot; for 6.0.
<BR>
I suppose this isn't unreasonable considering that it was probably not a huge
<BR>
volume seller, but it's a nuisance to me since I actually do have Intel, Alpha,
<BR>
and SPARC boxen I want it installed on.  Since the price has also gone up to
<BR>
$80, this means that I'm going to have to shell out $240(!) if I want &quot;official&quot;
<BR>
discs for all three.  Compare that to the $40 for RH 5.2 Variety Pack.
<BR>
<P>I don't know whether to be annoyed by the fact that the Alpha &amp; SPARC versions
<BR>
are the same price as the Intel version despite the apparent absence of the
<BR>
&quot;Applications CD.&quot;  I guess the idea is that this app CD is a &quot;free&quot; bonus,
<BR>
though.  (Does anyone know if the Alpha version comes with this Application CD?)
<BR>
<P>What's most annoying of all, though, is that there is no &quot;Linux Core&quot; (i.e.
<BR>
just the disc, no support, no manual) for Alpha or SPARC.  It almost appears
<BR>
as though our Red Hat friends rolled out 6.0 for Intel, with at least the Alpha
<BR>
as an afterthought.
<BR>
<P><P>So, does anyone have any insight into whether Red Hat will be resurrecting the
<BR>
Variety Pack or adding Core versions of Alpha and SPARC for 6.0?  I can't afford
<BR>
$240, so if the answer is &quot;no&quot; I might have a problem.
<BR>
<P><P>(I can always just get the www.cheapbytes.com version, I suppose, or use an FTP
<BR>
install, but I do like to support Red Hat, just not at these prices.)
