<P>
Please don't kill me... I want to make sure before I order. I know that
<BR>
there has been a great deal of traffic on this, but I am still not
<BR>
clear. After following the list, I think that I have settled on the AT
<BR>
Expert 98 video card for my Multia. It looks like a good buy. My
<BR>
question is, when I have checked them out on pricewatch a cnet, they say
<BR>
AGP (as opposed to PCI). Does the Multia support the AGP card or am I
<BR>
looking at the wrong one? CNet also showed an looking at the wrong one? CNet also showed an Expert@Play with a TV Out
<BR>
for $12 more that was labeled as PCI. I would appreciate any feedback.
<BR>
So far, I have my Multia and SCSI HD. I have my memory, CD and external
<BR>
SCSI case on order. Thanks for any feedback.
