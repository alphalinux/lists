<P>I just had a look at their FTP site and say nothing. Have you tried asking

them? I haven't heard anything about them placing it on an ftp site, it

<P>Hmmm.. talking about SuSE on the RedHat axp-list... oh well.
<BR>
<P>I installed it on an LX at work. The hardest part was that the install
<BR>
directions had yet to be translated and I don't speak German!
<BR>
<P>I'd never installed SuSE before but the install was fairly painless. Yast
<BR>
was rather interesting and they have a nice X-Setup tool.
<BR>
<P>There are still some problem, like the install screens tell you to make a
<BR>
boot disk and explain LILO to you :) but I'm sure that stuff will get
<BR>
worked out in time.
