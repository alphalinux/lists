<EM>&gt;The 2.0 kernels did &quot;parallel make&quot; via breadth-then-depth; when dropping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;into a subdirectory, compile jobs would be spawned for all the files in that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;directory, and then wait for those to finish before going on to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;subdirectories or popping back up to do any siblings, etc, etc. So
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;essentially the number of parallel compiles was limited to how many compiles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;were at a certain directory level, ie drivers/scsi would spawn off compiles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for all the drivers configured plus the &quot;generic&quot; SCSI subsystem sources
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(like scsi.c and hosts.c).  This never got so big to cause problems; I like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to run a pair of parallel makes in infinite loops to put a test load on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now, the 2.2 kernels changed to a depth-then-breadth technique (at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that's what it looks like to me), in which all directory levels are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;activated at the same time (unless limited by a max number of processes to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;spawn, ie -j 8), with one compile at each level. This results, with just -j
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and no max limit, in a veritable flood of processes/compiles starting up,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and it seems to overwhelm some part of the system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So, I ask again, anyone know why this was done, and does it adversely affect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the INTELs as much as it does the ALPHAs, if just done with -j?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Here's what I seem to remember:
<BR>
<P>-j&lt;n&gt; does not inherit from toplevel make to subdirectory make: you start
<BR>
&lt;n&gt; of them, but each is executed sequentially.
<BR>
<P>-j does inherit, so you start all makes and sub-makes and sub-sub-makes and
<BR>
all tasks at once: this may get you into problems.
<BR>
<P>in the older kernels the &quot;structure of the toplevel makefile would prevent
<BR>
paralellism&quot; at that level. -j would work one subdirectory at a time: a
<BR>
system with a reasonable amount of RAM would handle that.
<BR>
<P>-j&lt;n&gt; would have no effect at all with these kernels: you had to change the
<BR>
MAKE= line in the makefile to get a -j&lt;n&gt; to the sub-makes.
<BR>
<P><P>the &quot;...&quot; above is a quote-by-heart from a posting on smp-list. I think it
<BR>
was from Linus himself, so at least the original (which may differ from my
<BR>
memory) must have been correct.
