<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't want to start a flame war here, but which product is better

<EM>&gt; &gt; (excluding the NDA bit with APC); one from APC or one from Best Power?

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; Best Power had always a good attitude and was helpful to Linux users
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with information and support.  There were number of skirmishes with APC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which was creating all kind of obstacles.  Make your own conclusions.
</EM><BR>
<P>I second this sentiment.  I purchased two Best UPSs a year plus ago when
<BR>
i needed the same protection that everyone else needs.  I chose Best
<BR>
based on the current wisdom that they were Linux-friendly and APC, et. al.
<BR>
were not.  They provide source to their monitoring daemon, which, while
<BR>
not as sophisticated as the Windows software, gets the job done.  It also
<BR>
is a good start for understanding how the UPS communicates with the host.
<BR>
<P>But you don't even need to reverse engineer the source code--I called
<BR>
BestPower the next day and asked for the technical specifications manual.
<BR>
They shipped 50 photocopied pages FedEx *next-day* and I was on my way
<BR>
to coding bliss.
<BR>
<P>P.S.  I still haven't finished my UPS monitoring program (I was going to 
<BR>
do a big X interface and everything to &quot;compete&quot; with their Windows 
<BR>
software), but that's not the point.  Best supported me in my quest to 
<BR>
use open source software and open spec hardware by providing me the
<BR>
details I needed and being their to ask questions of--I don't think I
<BR>
could ask for more from a hardware company.
<BR>
<P>Also, I have asked them recently if they plan any GUI utilities for
<BR>
configuring/monitoring UPS status under Linux.  They haven't the resources
<BR>
to commit to that now, but they did say that they are interested in what
<BR>
the Linux/UNIX community wants.  They were definitely going to consider
<BR>
it.  Get this--I emailed my simple request to the basic support address,
<BR>
and got a reply from THREE different people--all technically knowledgeable.
<BR>
<P>Now that's service.  I'm convinced, Best is BEST!!
