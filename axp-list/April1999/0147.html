Hi.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a machine with the Mach64 chip set in it (Advertised as a ATI
<BR>
@PLAY, but scans as having a MACH64 chip.) Just the same, it performs very
<BR>
well. I've run it with both XFree86 , and with MetroX with no problems on
<BR>
either. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops. There is one minor problem. I've ALWAYS had to hand edit the
<BR>
config file. It insists on putting a wrong setting on the mode line when your
<BR>
trying to get resoultions like 1280x1024 @ 32bpp. The default setting doesn't
<BR>
work (at least mine hasn't).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the proper mode-line worked out for this, and mine runs
<BR>
flaslessly on it. I'll send it along if anyone is interested in it.
<BR>

<EM>&gt;Hello everyone,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A while back, I posted a problem with the SVGA server compiled by egcs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and with Matrox Mill II card. The problem was that fonts were screwed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;up when switching back to console after going into X.(people on Intel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seem to not have this problem... why only on Alpha?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm wondering if anyone knows if the Mach64 has this same problem? Or,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can someone confirm that Mach64 definitely does not have this problem?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm about to get a new video card for a new 21inch monitor... my two
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;choices are Matrix Mill II w/8MB or a ATI &gt;choices are Matrix Mill II w/8MB or a ATI Xpert@Play w/8MB... if I can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;avoid the screwed up font problem by simply going with a Rage Pro
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;card.. I'd prefer that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Thanks in advance for any helpful suggestions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;D.
