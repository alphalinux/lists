<P>
<EM>&gt; Why buy the official one then? Just get your friendly local person with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CD Writer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to write you a GPL version.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I bought RH5.1/Alpha, had problems registering it and didn't get anything in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the way of help as I remember.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I won't be buying the official version again.
</EM><BR>
<P>I second the motion and applaud. I have been trying to get all the
<BR>
distribution rpms for Alpha, but it seems that as of 7:34 EDT only i386 and
<BR>
sparc have been mirrored, even at gatekeeper (isn't the first letter of
<BR>
alpha an a?).
<BR>
Anyway, I am planning to burn the distribution onto a CD, and initially I
<BR>
wasn't too worried about making bootable, but now I am considering it. Last
<BR>
night I made a thorough web search, but I could only come out with the
<BR>
CD-ROM HOWTO.
<BR>
<P>Therefore I was quite happy when I read:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For up to 5.2/AXP this was valid(*): Grap all the necessary stuff from an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ftp mirror near you, execpt the /dev directory, which you should grab
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; directly from ftp.redhat.com with on-the-fly-tar, otherwise you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; won't get real device nodes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Pertain the directory structure. The RedHat directory belongs to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; root of the CD.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is all what's needed for ARC and AlphaBIOS. To make it bootable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by SRM, you need to grep the aboot package, and make it boot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; '/misc/bootlx', I believe.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have a few questions about the above instructions:
<BR>
What is on-the-fly-tar? I am assuming that it is a combination of tar and
<BR>
rsh, but don't really know how to do it.
<BR>
What is &quot;grep the aboot package&quot;?
<BR>
<P>Could you please point me to where I can find answers to these questions?
<BR>
<P>I known that the members of this list usually frown upon this type of
<BR>
questions, thus feel free to answer to this message privately and I will
<BR>
send a summary to those who asked similar questions.
<BR>
Thank you,
<BR>
ZP
