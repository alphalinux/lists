I dont understand the &quot;Matrox isn't scared though&quot;. Matrox doesn't release
<BR>
any of their card specs. I tried with the G200 agp, but no luck. I just get
<BR>
the double talk that they will release the specs someday, but considering
<BR>
that i haven't been able to get any chip specs on any of the matrox cards, i
<BR>
think that matrox falls into the same category as not revealing chip specs!

<EM>&gt; This is similar to the inability of getting chip makers to reveal how to

<EM>&gt; program 3D chips (Matrox isn't scared though).  Other makers seem to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think that it would reveal their intelectual property in a manner that
