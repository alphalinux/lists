<EM>&gt; Seems the biggest issue is lack of availabilty of choices on the AlphaLinux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; platform.

<P>Well, I have some experience with a commercial Cyrus for Digital Unix.
<BR>
Why anybody sane would want to subject her/himself to all these bugs and
<BR>
aggravations, with scant chances for real resolutions, is still beyond
<BR>
my comprehension.  It was not a choice of mine and, thankfully, I was only
<BR>
giving a hand from time to time.  Recovering corrupted mailboxes
<BR>
for users, without real tools and/or information, was only a part of fun.
<BR>
Other part of &quot;fun&quot; was to be on a recipient side of such &quot;recovery&quot;.
<BR>
At least they were getting an information back - if not in the most
<BR>
convenient form.  Probably the least onerous was a task of cleaning
<BR>
of core files which Cyrus was leaving regularly in various places.
<BR>
I am truly glad that I do not have to touch that stuff anymore.
<BR>
<P>I will take something with a source any day.  I had to rewrite
<BR>
various scripts (here a source was available :-) in any case.
