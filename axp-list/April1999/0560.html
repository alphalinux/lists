<P><EM>&gt; 1)  These motherboards do NOT use ECC memory, correct?  The documentation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the motherboard certainly implies this.
</EM><BR>
<P>As far as I can tell, it does not *require* ECC, as some other alpha
<BR>
boards do.  I am certainly using mine with non-ECC and it works fine.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2) Several memory vendors mention EPROM on the DIMM.  Do I, as a system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; builder, really care about this?  Or does the system take care of it?
</EM><BR>
<P>I bought a pair of EPROM DIMMs for my SX and they were not recognized.
<BR>
I contacted DCG, where I had originally bought the computer, and they
<BR>
explained that sometimes the information in the EPROM can confuse an
<BR>
alpha, so the EPROM would have to be blanked.  The memory vendor said
<BR>
that they could blank the EPROM, but this would void the warranty,
<BR>
fortunately though they were willing to take the memory back.  I ended
<BR>
up buying correct memory from DCG.  Remember, it takes DIMMS in pairs.
<BR>
<P>So, I would suggest getting your memory from a place who know that it
<BR>
will work on the SX, such as <A HREF="http://www.dcginc.com/">http://www.dcginc.com/</A> or one of the
<BR>
other alpha vendors.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3)  Does RedHat support IDE disks &gt; 8 GB?  I'm thinking about buying a 13.5
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; GB disk, as they're not that much more expensive than the 6 GB disks that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seem to be the bottom end disks.
</EM><BR>
<P>I do not see why it would not.  The alpha is not hampered by the PC
<BR>
BIOS limitations on disk size, boot partitions, and such.
