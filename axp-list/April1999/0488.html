Hello;
<BR>
<P>I would like to poll the collective knowledge of axp-list and the
<BR>
Linux/DecStation folk for advice/wisdom on how to provide linux
<BR>
support for the DEC 3000 series of turbochannel based alphas.
<BR>
<P>This is something I'm interested in working on for the learning
<BR>
experience and for fun... I've never done remotely anything like this
<BR>
before, so I'm sure it would take me some time to advance upon the
<BR>
learning curve.  I do have access to a wide variety of alpha hardware at
<BR>
work, turbochannel and PCI based, running Linux and Digital Unix, and
<BR>
also have an AS200 at home to work on.  And since a lot of the
<BR>
hardware on the DecStations and the DEC 3000 AXPs is the same, I'd
<BR>
imagine that a lot of the Linux/DecStation work would apply to the
<BR>
turbochannel alphas, and allow me contribute to both development
<BR>
efforts at the same time.  And the *BSDs already have support for
<BR>
these alphas...  
<BR>
<P>I have never worked in a cross-platform development environment,
<BR>
though, and have never done any kernel related work either.  So I
<BR>
really don't know where to start... there does seem to be a wealth of
<BR>
documentation available regarding the hardware.  I should add that
<BR>
I've read Jim Paradis' Kernel Korner article describing the port of
<BR>
linux to the alpha, and that I certainly do not understand all the
<BR>
details therein... but I do have (userland) software development
<BR>
experience, and motivation to learn!
<BR>
<P>If anyone could provide ideas for a &quot;roadmap&quot;, point me at docs, tell
<BR>
me that I'm crazy to even think about this and/or that it is seems
<BR>
evident I do not have the skills to contribute to something like this,
<BR>
or *anything* you think is relevant , I'd be grateful!
<BR>
<P>Thanks in advance,
<BR>
Craig
