<EM>&gt; See what happens when I get a day off, I get email happy. After NetScape
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; puked, I got to ATIs site and found the info on the Expert 98 and found
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that there is also a PCI version. I assume that there would be no reason
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; why the TV out would not work on the PCI &gt; why the TV out would not work on the PCI Expert@Play.
</EM><BR>
<P>AFAIK, ATI has _NEVER_ released their specs related to the TV capability.
<BR>
This is similar to the inability of getting chip makers to reveal how to
<BR>
program 3D chips (Matrox isn't scared though).  Other makers seem to
<BR>
think that it would reveal their intelectual property in a manner that
<BR>
other companies would steal.
<BR>
<P>Unless you have a Linux driver specific to your card (chipset), it will
<BR>
not work. I am not up to the latest on what is supported by Linux.
