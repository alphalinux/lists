<P>
The folks over at Mozilla have introduced an asm dependency into the most recent
<BR>
milestone for mozilla.  This is bad since they seem to have no Alpha hackers over
<BR>
there, so there is currently no Alpha asm for this project, and so there is no
<BR>
mozilla for the Alpha.
<BR>
<P>The asm in question is part of the &quot;XPConnect&quot; code, which is the module mozilla
<BR>
uses to e.g. get JavaScript to talk to the HTML renderer, let Java call
<BR>
JavaScript, let JavaScript call Java, ad nauseum.  What the asm has to do is
<BR>
set up an arbitrary, runtime calling environment (i.e. do what the compiler
<BR>
normally does at runtime, except that it must be done at runtime in this case to
<BR>
allow arbitrary XPConnect objects to call other objects that may not be in the
<BR>
same language.)
<BR>
<P>I, unfortunately, have no knowledge of Alpha asm other than that it exists, or
<BR>
else I would do this myself.  My understanding is that it's not a great quantity
<BR>
of code.
<BR>
<P>Is anyone out there working on this, or is anyone out there interested in working
<BR>
on it?  Mozilla otherwise builds perfectly fine on Alpha/Linux, and it'd be a
<BR>
shame to fall behind due to a little asm.
<BR>
