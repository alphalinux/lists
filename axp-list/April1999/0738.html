<P>Okay, thanks.  That helps a lot.  The problem with 2.2.6 may be related to
<BR>
the modules, at least in part.  The SCSI tape problem most likely as the
<BR>
insmod hung and acted erratically.  IP Masq protocols must be loaded as
<BR>
modules so that may play a factor, but I don't know offhand what the problem
<BR>
would have been with aliasing.  Perhaps it is an initscript problem.

<P>Where are archives stored now?  i've been to archive.redhat.com a few times
<BR>
in the past few weeks trying to get problems resolved from my botched

upgrade attempts, but they seem to run 3-6 months slow, which tends not to

be very helpful.  Is there a better primary source now?  alphalinux.org?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But in my experience, 2.2.x on alpha is pretty great.  :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm glad to hear that.  At least now I have hope.  =)
<BR>
<P>I've gotten the kernel-2.2 updates from alphalinux.org and will try
<BR>
installing them as the week progresses.  insmod problems may have been
<BR>
related to a too-old version of modutils.

<P>Thanks for the help,
