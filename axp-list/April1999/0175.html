Hello,
<BR>
<P>As in my previous posts, I've managed to lock myself out of my system.
<BR>
The kernel boots, but one of the processes during init stalls and
<BR>
doesn't allow me to get a shell. 
<BR>
<P>I've tried several things already... like overriding the init with
<BR>
init=/bin/sh ... no go... someone suggested I use a debian disk since
<BR>
Redhat doesn't seem to have a root-fs image for a floppy for Alpha.
<BR>
This came out really awkward.. after the kernel loaded from my hard
<BR>
drive, and I tried mounting the root1440.bin disk as root, I get a
<BR>
kernel panic with some odd messages and finally:
<BR>
<P>Kernel Panic: VFS unable to mount root
<BR>
<P>according to the docs, the root1440.bin disk is a ext2 fs... which my
<BR>
kernel has built in support... and which is the same fs as my hard
<BR>
drive which gets mounted fine. I believe I even have fat16 support in
<BR>
my kernel... 
<BR>
<P>I tried mounting a redhat intel rescue.img disk.. which I know has a
<BR>
ext2 fs but with intel binaries... the same thing occurs. I would
<BR>
think at least I can mount the disk.. even thou it wouldn't be able to
<BR>
run init off that disk or anything else. 
<BR>
<P>Now I'm beginning to have doubts if even if I got a ext2 fs with alpha
<BR>
binaries root floppy... will I be able to mount it? what is wrong here? 
<BR>
<P>OH, and I tried booting off the Debian boot disk too... MILO returned
<BR>
saying it failed to load kernel.
<BR>
<P>there has got to be a way to get single user mode some how??... damn
<BR>
it!!! or mount a separate root fs.. and mount the hd so I can fix my
<BR>
system... 
<BR>
<P>if anyone is still awake, and has any suggestions, or would be kind
<BR>
enough to build a root fs image for me to download... please, please
<BR>
do... thanks.
<BR>
<P>D.
<BR>
<P>p.s.- just to be clear.. I have access to MILO no problem.. I have my
<BR>
AlphaBIOS setup to give me an option to drop me into MILO.. so
<BR>
anything from there that can get me r/w access to my hd would do...
