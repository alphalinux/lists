<EM>&gt;I had similar memory problems with my LX board with the Pyxsis? chipset.

<P>I have 4 DIMMs in my Alpha and it seems to be happy - I have 2x128MB and
<BR>
2x32MB.  The first pair of 128's I bought were very very touchy;

however I then bought a pair from a dealer which specifically supported
<BR>
Alpha and they are OK.  I think this pair are actually spec'd as PC100-7ns.
