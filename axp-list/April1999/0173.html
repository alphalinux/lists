Hello,
<BR>
<P>Well... I recalled that I could override init after boot... so I tried:
<BR>
<P>from MILO
<BR>
<P>boot sda3:vmlinux.gz root=/dev/sda3 init=/bin/sh 
<BR>
<P>in hopes of getting some sort of shell to fix my system.
<BR>
unfortunately, when it gets to that part, it freezes... I remember I
<BR>
could do this with Linux on Intel.. is there something different on
<BR>
Alpha?
<BR>
<P>I also searched redhat's site for an image of a root fs... couldn't
<BR>
find one... only for i386...(I wish they would make a rescue.img for
<BR>
Alpha like they do for Intel) is there some place I can download a
<BR>
root fs with alpha binaries???
<BR>
<P>ahh!! this totally sucks, INET starts before it gets to the
<BR>
problematic X Font Server... but I had disabled telnet so I can't even
<BR>
get a shell over the network. And it doesn't get far enough for me to
<BR>
switch to a virtual terminal... I think my only option now is to get a
<BR>
image of a root fs for Alpha... 
<BR>
<P>Please, if you can help.... I would appreciate it so much!!
<BR>
<P>D.
