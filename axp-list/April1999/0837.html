<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I've seen problems on the UX where the firmware checks bad on

&nbsp;&nbsp;power-up but checks good when running.  The UX seems sensitive

&nbsp;&nbsp;it fail.  Does it fail if you hit the reset switch?

<P>hi kelvin,
<BR>
<P>yeah it fails no matter what.
<BR>
<P>anyway. I solved it eventually by installing the 3.0.61 firmware on
<BR>
the alpha-processer website. Strange that neither 3.0.60 or .61 from
<BR>
deskstation worked, but that the supposedly same firmware from
<BR>
another site did work.
<BR>
<P>I now have another problem. If I put a video card into the 64-bit PCI
<BR>
slot it doesn't start at all. The fans come on, and that's it, no
<BR>
beeps, nothing. I've tried with a Trident TGUI9680 and a Matrox
<BR>
Millenium2. It boots fine with either card in any of the 32-bit
<BR>
slots - but then milo doesn't recognise cards in the 32bit slots.
<BR>
<P>I tried putting a Buslogic SCSI controller in the 64-bit slot, with
<BR>
the Millenium in a 32bit slot - to see if it was a slot problem or a
<BR>
VGA problem - and again the machine wouldn't boot. So it seems to be
<BR>
a problem with the 64bit slot. 
<BR>
<P>Also, the machine nearly never powers down when i hit the power-off
<BR>
button. it's not the switch cause i tried it with the reset switch
<BR>
plugged into the soft-power jumper on the board. It did work on a few
<BR>
occasions though - but i can't figure out why.
<BR>
<P>Basically I'm having a lot of weird problems with this board. I've no
<BR>
other experience of Samsung boards, so whether weirdness is normal or
<BR>
not i don't know.
<BR>
<P>If it was a pc i'd say the motherboard is defective. Any issues with
<BR>
Samsung UX's i should know about? The case is 300W, and the company i
<BR>
bought the parts from sells workstations based on the UX and this
<BR>
case.
<BR>
<P>thanks for your help,
<BR>
<P>Paul Jakma.

<EM>  &gt; I've flashed the firmware on a Samsung 164UX. It orignally had .60, i
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; flashed it with the .61 from deskstation. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; Now the alpha start's into safe arcbios everytime!
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; as it starts it gives the usual short boot warble sound. then 
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; it beeps twice
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; followed by a short beep. then it comes up the safe arcbios screen.
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; according to the manual this beep code means &quot;ARCSBios has 
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; bad checksum,
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; will boot safe ARCSBIOS&quot;. But according to &quot;show firmware 
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; revisions&quot; screen
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; in safe arcsbios, the checksums are ok.
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; i've tried flashing the .60 firmware from deskstation into 
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; it, but it stays
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; the same.
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; I've tried looking on the samsungsemi site, but can't find 
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; any firmware
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; downloads.
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; any suggestions? i prepared the firmware upgrade disk under 
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; win98's dos. i
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; don't have access to another alpha. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; help.....
