<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, what's most annoying is the way they try and market themselves as being this giant mega-support company, and yet I've never heard a positive support story with them involved.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screw RedHat. Support your friendly software competitor.
