<P>
I recently updated to kernel 2.2.6 (from 2.2.3), and when I rebooted, it
<BR>
crashed on bootup with a swapper panic (and a register dump).
<BR>
<P>Does anybody have the 2.2.6 kernel working?  If so, what did you do?
<BR>
<P>Later, he was to decide that Andrew's life had been fractally weird. That
<BR>
is, you could take any small piece of it and examine it in detail and it, in
<BR>
and of itself, would turn out to be just as complicated and weird as the
<BR>
whole thing in its entirety.
