<EM>&gt; Well... I recalled that I could override init after boot... so I tried:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in hopes of getting some sort of shell to fix my system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unfortunately, when it gets to that part, it freezes... I remember I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could do this with Linux on Intel.. is there something different on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha?
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I also searched redhat's site for an image of a root fs... couldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; find one... only for i386...(I wish they would make a rescue.img for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha like they do for Intel) is there some place I can download a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; root fs with alpha binaries???
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes; get it from your favorite distribution.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ahh!! this totally sucks, INET starts before it gets to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problematic X Font Server... but I had disabled telnet so I can't even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get a shell over the network. And it doesn't get far enough for me to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; switch to a virtual terminal... I think my only option now is to get a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; image of a root fs for Alpha... 
</EM><BR>
<P>Get a boot disk if your kernel is screwed.  Have you tried booting
<BR>
into single user mode (a different runlevel and init configuration)? 
<BR>
Get a root disk if not.  It's really not that big a problem.  Not
<BR>
like your hard drive is toast; you just need another way to boot
<BR>
to fix it.
