<BR>
<EM>&gt; How do I force it into 100baseTX? I've looked in the /etc/ directory,

and

you

can't

<EM>&gt; find where to add it. (i.e. there are no explicit ifconfig lines with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; explicit parameters for which I could provide additional values)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've very new to networking, (but desperate to learn), so some

pointers

<EM>&gt; would be nice.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two things can fix it, depending on how your kernel is configured. 
<BR>
If the tulip driver is linked in as a module then you can put something 
<BR>
like
<BR>
alias eth0 tulip
<BR>
options tulip options=0 debug=0
<BR>
<P>into /etc/conf.modules. The 'options' field takes a number between
<BR>
0 and 16 and goes from autosense (0) to force 100Mb full duplex
<BR>
(15). The source code doesn't make it very clear but Donald Becker's
<BR>
web page on it (<A HREF="http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/drivers/tulip.html">http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/drivers/tulip.html</A>) 
<BR>
has a table with the full list. If the kernel is monolithic then the 
<BR>
easiest thing is to hack the driver source code 
<BR>
(/usr/src/linux/drivers/net/tulip.c most of the time) to force the
<BR>
carrier
<BR>
type. Up the debugging level like this as well so you can see what's
<BR>
going on. The two values you need to set are options and tulip_debug.
<BR>
(about lines 31 &amp; 133 in my tulip driver -0.89H - YMMV)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I understand that the answer perhaps may be &quot;your tulip chip is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; buggered&quot;. Is there a way from the console to tell whether that's the
</EM><BR>
case
<BR>
<EM>&gt; or do I need to take the lid off (which I am loathed to do).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Phil
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>This is also a possibility! Quite a few of the UX boards came with
<BR>
buggered crystals on the tulip card which stopped them working
<BR>
properly at 100MHz. Unfortunately I can't find the article I used to
<BR>
have which told you what serial number they had on them. Again,
<BR>
upping the debug level will give you much more information (in
<BR>
fact if you whack it right up you'll probably run out of disk space
<BR>
due to the size of your log files ;-)
<BR>
<P>cheers
