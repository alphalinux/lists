<P>
<EM>&gt; First, there is apparently not (as of right now anyway) a &quot;Variety
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Pack&quot; for 6.0.
</EM><BR>
<P>With 5.1, it was &quot;power tools&quot;. With 5.2, it was the Variety Pack.
<BR>
They may release an equivalent soonish. If they don't release it fast
<BR>
enough, buy it from Cheapbytes. No service, no sale.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Since the price has also gone up to $80
</EM><BR>
<P>Remember the model: most of that charge should be for the installation
<BR>
support, which you don't sound like you need. I'd like to buy a real
<BR>
way to complain about real problems for the 290 machines I have
<BR>
running Linux, but they don't have one. I don't need handholding, and
<BR>
that's all that 3rd parties and Redhat offer. So, no money flows.
<BR>
That's life.
