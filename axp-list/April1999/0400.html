<EM>&gt; I was one of the ones that purchased the $250 164SX boards and now I'm 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looking for a decent, but cheap video card.  I know the Matrox Mill II were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; popular, but I don't see them listed forsale anymore.  Is one of their other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cards the same now, or as good?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, you've asked a pretty open-ended question.  More
<BR>
than likely everyone on the list has their own opinion of what's hot and
<BR>
what's not.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what it's worth, I have a Diamond FireGL 1000 Pro with
<BR>
8M in my PWS 500a.  It runs beautifully at 8M in my PWS 500a.  It runs beautifully at 1024x768@32bpp (85hz refresh
<BR>
&nbsp;on my 19&quot; monitor).  One additional advantage is that the hardware-accel
<BR>
OpenGL server from Xi will support the Permedia2 (and Permedia3 when it
<BR>
&nbsp;comes out, I imagine).  To the best of my knowledge, none of the Matrox
<BR>
cards provide native OpenGL support - as I understand, they require
<BR>
GL-&gt;Direct3D wrappers.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It all really depends on what your application is.  Graphics are 
<BR>
not a big part of what I do with my system, although it is nice to know the
<BR>
capability is there.  Let's face it, detailed graphics at high resolutions and
<BR>
high colour depth can be pretty - and the $120 I spent on the FireGL Pro
<BR>
are well worth it, from that perspective.   
<BR>
Of course, all this is in my humble opinion :)
<BR>
