Hi Y'll
<BR>
<P>Been struggling with these all day. Metrox Millennium II with 4/8MB
<BR>
of RAM:
<BR>
<P>X11:
<BR>
<P>*  The SVGA driver blacks out the screen and goes south on just about
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any setup.  Very same card, very same code work fine in an LX164.
<BR>
<P>*  Tried the Metrolink one.  $39.00 later - Same result;  the config
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;works, the server hangs.
<BR>
<P>*  Tried to compile the XFBdev driver;  No luck.  Way too broken for my
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ultra-tight schedule.
<BR>
<P>*  Found a server from Suse;  Has bizzare shlib links.  most are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resolvable, but one:  What the hack is libgz?  Can find neither hair
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor hind of it anywhere.
<BR>
<P>*  Configuring the kernel for the frame buffer is all but simple. the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;working combination here is everything is compiled into the kernel
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;except for the matroxfb driver.  This one must be a module, or else
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your kernel will hang/freeze real good at boot time.  First thing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after it tells you how it was compiled.  I can nicely have the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;display at 1600x1200x32, but the type is on the small side :-) Anyone
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with giant fonts that work?
<BR>
<P>Shutdown:
<BR>
<P>*  Seems like the PCI subsystem preserves some states that it tries to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be nice to the SRM and restore.  Problem is it is too eager and pulls
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the rug from under the drivers' feet.  The result is that either the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drivers (typically SCSI) complain bitterly, or the kernel blows its
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top with illegal instructions and whathaveyou.
<BR>
<P>*  If that is survived (typically it leaves the shutdown scripts
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hanging), the SRM is not at all happy with the results.  Me thinks
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be better resetting the darn machine.
<BR>
<P>*  MD is a bit fragile;  It tends to rebuild the arrays too much. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially after a crash.  Eventually it gets confused and causes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mount &amp; co. to oops the kernel.  It should probably learn to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distinguish abrupt shutdown from a crash and handle writing through
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its buffers more intelligently.  Just a thought.
<BR>
<P>*  Building a kernel from clean is about 2-3 minutes with -j 8. Much
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more than 8 and gmake looses it, emitting nonsense errors, etc.
<BR>
<P>Any help on these matters (including re-directs :-) will be much
<BR>
appreciated.
<BR>
<P>Sincerely Yours,                 <A HREF="mailto:Shimon@Simon-Shapiro.ORG?subject=Re:%20DS20%20Assorted%20Difficulties">Shimon@Simon-Shapiro.ORG</A>

<P>Unwritten code has no bugs and executes at twice the speed of mouth
