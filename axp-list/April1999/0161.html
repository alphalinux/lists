<EM>&gt;Well, that's the first in-the-press announcement I've seen of this. It

<EM>&gt;exceeds what the manager of the GEM compiler group says, so it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;probably not exactly true, but hey...
</EM><BR>
<P>It's the top story today at Compaq's &quot;newsroom&quot;:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.compaq.com/newsroom/pr/1999/pr060499a.html">http://www.compaq.com/newsroom/pr/1999/pr060499a.html</A>

<P><P>Scroll down to this section:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Linux and Tru64 UNIX Compatibility; Compaq Support
<BR>
<P><P>For instance they claim a factor of two for Fortran:
<BR>
<P>------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
Compaq has now incorporated Linux into its enterprise UNIX
<BR>
strategy, emphasizing its intentions to increase Linux and Tru64
<BR>
UNIX application and product compatibility. [...]
<BR>
<P>Further establishing AlphaServers as the high performance leader
<BR>
in Linux systems, and in direct response to demand from High
<BR>
Performance Technical Computing customers, Compaq is also
<BR>
porting its Tru64 UNIX Alpha Fortan and C compilers along with
<BR>
the associated runtime libraries to Linux (Alpha) later this year.
<BR>
Additional compilers/development tools will be considered as
<BR>
more requirements are identified. Early testing has shown that the
<BR>
code generated by Compaq Fortran for Linux on AlphaServers will
<BR>
perform floating point calculations at least twice as fast as code
<BR>
generated by the g77 compiler for Linux on AlphaServers.
<BR>
<P>Within the next 90 days, Compaq Services will introduce customer
<BR>
support services for the Linux operating system running on
<BR>
Compaq's Alpha- and Intel-based servers. [...]
<BR>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P><P>Looking good!  =:-)
<BR>
<P>Although there may be a factor of two gained on floating-point Fortran
<BR>
programs compared to g77, for the sort of integer work in C that I do
<BR>
the gain is typically more like 0.9 to 1.3 times compared to gcc/egcs.
<BR>
<P>People shouldn't lock on to the &quot;two times&quot; meme and claim that
<BR>
Compaq's compilers are universally twice as fast.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes twice as fast: sure.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Always    twice as fast: no way.
<BR>
<P><P>There's a lot of variation.  The bottom line is: benchmark your own code!
<BR>
<P>Bye,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rob.
