The simple answer is that I work at a fairly conservative Wall St. firm and
<BR>
getting my management to even consider Linux was a huge step.  They really
<BR>
could give a &quot;rat's hindquarters&quot; about core files or who cleans them up.
<BR>
That's what we have ops people for.. :-)
<BR>
<P>My group has the freedom to choose -- AS LONG as a company (i.e., someone
<BR>
we can sue) is willing to support the app.  My management will even pay a
<BR>
company to port their app (hence my questions about Cgate and post.office).
<BR>
&nbsp;For the record, we don't hire programmers full-time either.  Contract only.
<BR>
<P>In other words, it's either commercially-supported apps on AlphaLinux, or
<BR>
MS Exchange.
<BR>
<P>And this isn't even for a production use!  I guess the next time I post a
<BR>
question, I'll need to request that opinions be sent to /dev/null..  :-)

<EM>&gt;Well, I have some experience with a commercial Cyrus for Digital Unix.

<EM>&gt;Why anybody sane would want to subject her/himself to all these bugs and

<EM>&gt;aggravations, with scant chances for real resolutions, is still beyond
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;my comprehension.  It was not a choice of mine and, thankfully, I was only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;giving a hand from time to time.  Recovering corrupted mailboxes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for users, without real tools and/or information, was only a part of fun.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Other part of &quot;fun&quot; was to be on a recipient side of such &quot;recovery&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;At least they were getting an information back - if not in the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;convenient form.  Probably the least onerous was a task of cleaning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of core files which Cyrus was leaving regularly in various places.

<EM>&gt;I am truly glad that I do not have to touch that stuff anymore.
