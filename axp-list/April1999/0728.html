Hello folks,
<BR>
<P>Been off the list for a while because everything was running smoothly.
<BR>
A botched libc upgrade hosed things pretty bad recently, but things are
<BR>
now precariously stable.  I thought I might upgrade to RH 6.0 but soon
<BR>
found that it doesn't seem to exist on Alpha.  Any quick word on this?
<BR>
<P>But for my problem (these may be related):  I can't get the 2.2.x series
<BR>
to function fully on my UDB.  I need to support IP Aliasing and
<BR>
IP Firewalling with transparent proxy and hopefully transparent port
<BR>
redirection (still looking into that).  Additionally, I have a SCSI tape
<BR>
drive that's not working, though it used to.  A recent Chernobyl attack
<BR>
has upped its priority.
<BR>
<P>Basically, I'm at this point:
<BR>
<P>Service           2.0.35      2.0.36    2.2.6
<BR>
IP Masquerading     yes         yes       no
<BR>
IP Aliasing          ?          yes       no
<BR>
SCSI tape           yes         was       no
<BR>
<P>If it weren't for the tape drive not working under 2.0.36, I would be
<BR>
content, but it doesn't.  I intend to recompile it as a non-module, but
<BR>
am wondering if I should instead just upgrade to the 2.2.6 series.  I
<BR>
would like to, but the problem (as you can see) is that nothing works
<BR>
(it also swaps eth0 and eth1 for some reason).  I think PCMCIA fails to
<BR>
compile under 2.2 as well, but I'm not sure.
<BR>
<P>I guess I'm just wondering if full Alpha support is in 2.2, or if I
<BR>
still need to apply alpha patches.  www.alphalinux.org doesn't have
<BR>
anything that I can see except raw sources, so I'm led to believe that
<BR>
this should work.  Can someone attest to this working?  I'm currently on
<BR>
RH 5.2, without the kernel 2.2 updates on alphalinux.org.  I realize
<BR>
this is less than ideal, but the kernel should still support things like
<BR>
IP aliasing without it.
<BR>
<P>I'm just a bit frazzled at the moment and looking for solace.  Should I
<BR>
try to get this working with 2.2, or is it a known problem that 2.2 and
<BR>
alpha just don't mix right now?
<BR>
<P>Thanks for any replies,
<BR>
Christopher Curtis
