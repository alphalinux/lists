<EM>&gt; Now, the 2.2 kernels changed to a depth-then-breadth technique (at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that's what it looks like to me), in which all directory levels are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; activated at the same time (unless limited by a max number of processes to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spawn, ie -j 8), with one compile at each level. This results, with just -j
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and no max limit, in a veritable flood of processes/compiles starting up,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and it seems to overwhelm some part of the system.

<P>OIC. I have hit a perhaps identical bug: I have some gizmos which do
<BR>
things in parallel on all the machines in my cluster, which means 290
<BR>
forks in a row. At times this is not reliable on AlphaLinux (&quot;resource
<BR>
temporarily unavailable&quot;). But my test program didn't succeed in
<BR>
breaking things, so I gave up trying to characterize it. Apparently
<BR>
the process you fork has to actually do something, and then the
<BR>
planets have to be in alignment. I've never seen that problem in Intel
<BR>
Linux.
