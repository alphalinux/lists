<EM>&gt; I am thinking of getting a ups...  Fridge is on same circut and can cause
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my power to dip a lot.  I have seen 5% CPU voltage swings on my Intel Box.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I want to have source so that I can run it on my alpha.  Does anyone have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experiance with this.  I want all of the fancy monitering tools (Int temp,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Voltage, etc)  Does APC still keep their specs under NDA?  Is BEST still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my &quot;Best&quot; bet :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>I recently bought a Tripp Lite, for I live on an island and the main power
<BR>
cable frayed and now we live off generator. The power goes down every two
<BR>
days for a minute or so. Anyway, the UPS came with a coupon to redeem for a
<BR>
serial cable and a URL where one could get software (Linux was supported).
<BR>
Once I got the cable, I tried to install the software but I receive a couple
<BR>
of silly errors (not enough permissions or not enough disk space;
<BR>
considering that I was running the installation programme as root and have
<BR>
about 2 GB...). The error prompt made me suspect that Linux support should
<BR>
have read Linux i386 support. I wrote them asking them to clarify what kind
<BR>
of platforms did they encompass with their Linux support, but I already fear
<BR>
the answer. I also asked for the source code to attempt a compile (what I
<BR>
lack in knowledge, I overcompensate with optimism).
<BR>
The hardware works well; it has kept my machines running through all the
<BR>
outages and power anomalies. Do you know of any general purpose software for
<BR>
Alpha Linux to control UPS units?
