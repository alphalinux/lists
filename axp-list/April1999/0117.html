<P><EM>&gt; just a few questions regarding the SuSE 6.1 AXP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1. anyone have a working installation ?
</EM><BR>
<P>Did for a while, had to nuke it though. I might try installing it again on
<BR>
another machine if I get the chance though.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2. What kind stuff did you run into ?
</EM><BR>
<P>Docs are in German. Setup is still somewhat i386 oriented (like it makes
<BR>
LILO references). The installer wasn't very intuitive, at least I didn't
<BR>
think so. Unlike the RH installer there didn't seem to be a clear path
<BR>
through it, though if I had understood the docs that might have helped.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3. do you like it ?
</EM><BR>
<P>Ummm. Yeah, yast looked good, and looked similar to LinuxConf. I was
<BR>
really impressed with their X-setup tool (SaX I think it's called). 
<BR>
However this was just my impression for using it for a couple of hours. 
<BR>
<P>I was I had more time to play with it, as I've never even used their i386
<BR>
distribution before. 
<BR>
<P>BTW: This was on an LX, and it was pretty painless.
<BR>
<P>As usual, YMMV.
