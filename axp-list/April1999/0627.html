<EM>&gt; It would seem to me though, that seeing as how I have not modified the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contents of any of the directories since downloading it, then hdlist should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be accurate?

<P>If it indeed exists and corresponds to a disk contents.

<P>By a pure chance I have seen the same message today.  The problem turned
<BR>
out to be a faulty eb64p kernel on 5.2 distribution CD.  An installation
<BR>
process did not mount CD, but was quiet about it, and on the next screen
<BR>
I got &quot;...cannot find the header file&quot;.  This was indeed the case as
<BR>
there was nothing to find. :-)  You can check what is really available
<BR>
by switching at this moment to the second console (Alt-F2) and typing
<BR>
'mount'.  If you do not have CD mounted on /tmp/rhimage then you
<BR>
are in trouble.
<BR>
<P>The problem was solved by booting the 'generic' kernel from the same CD,
<BR>
instead of a platform specific one; CD got mounted and from this moment
<BR>
on everything was happy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Assuming then I must rebuild this file, how do I achieve this without having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; linux up and running?
</EM><BR>
<P>At this moment I do not know of any method to do that without some Linux
<BR>
machine around.  It does not have to be the same architecture.  C
<BR>
sources for this utility are available and likely can be adapted to any
<BR>
other Unix machine with a C compiler.  I was modifying it when I needed
<BR>
something not exactly &quot;usual&quot; but this was on Linux.  It likely would be
<BR>
hard to do that on some DOS box, including derivatives, as file names
<BR>
have to be case sensitive and with many dots in them.
<BR>
<P>BTW - not modifying 5.2 distribution is not a very hot idea as there
<BR>
were number of updates and quite a few of these were rather essential.
<BR>
Of course you can install and update results immediately.  Some of
<BR>
important updates were new installation images (ramdisk in particular)
<BR>
which showed up very quickly after an initial release.
