Hello everyone,
<BR>
<P>A while back, I posted a problem with the SVGA server compiled by egcs
<BR>
and with Matrox Mill II card. The problem was that fonts were screwed
<BR>
up when switching back to console after going into X.(people on Intel
<BR>
seem to not have this problem... why only on Alpha?)
<BR>
<P>I'm wondering if anyone knows if the Mach64 has this same problem? Or,
<BR>
can someone confirm that Mach64 definitely does not have this problem?
<BR>
<P>I'm about to get a new video card for a new 21inch monitor... my two
<BR>
choices are Matrix Mill II w/8MB or a ATI choices are Matrix Mill II w/8MB or a ATI Xpert@Play w/8MB... if I can
<BR>
avoid the screwed up font problem by simply going with a Rage Pro
<BR>
card.. I'd prefer that.
<BR>
<P>Thanks in advance for any helpful suggestions.
<BR>
D.
