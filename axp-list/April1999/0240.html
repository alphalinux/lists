I have a dual nic UDB running on both my college network and my in dorm
<BR>
network.  I am trying to use my laptop on both networks.  I figured it was
<BR>
time to configure dhcp on my laptop.  I am also having problems with
<BR>
that...  more on that later.  My alpha seemed like a good dhcpd server as
<BR>
it is up all of the time.  18 days as of now :-) (Kernel Re-Compile).
<BR>
Anyhow...  eth0 is the local network and eth1 is the campus wide ethernet.
<BR>
I set this exact same setup on an intel box just a little while ago and
<BR>
had no problems.  However my alpha is (no matter what I do) seeing the
<BR>
dhcp requests on the campus network and trying to respond to them.  I run
<BR>
dhcpd eth0 and it says that it is listening on eth0 and never says
<BR>
anything about eth1.  When I look at the logging however its a different
<BR>
story.  I see all of these requests from the campus network.  What is
<BR>
going on?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the laptop I don't know if anyone can help...  the cards
<BR>
services work fine so long as I am not using dhcp.  If I use dhcp and
<BR>
eject the card (either by software or by hand the card never gets fully
<BR>
removed.  If I manualy kill dhcpcd it then finishes removal.  Looking at
<BR>
the script I see that the script should be killing dhcpcd.  Even when I
<BR>
run &quot;/etc/pcmcia/network stop&quot; it seems to work.  What is cardmgr screwing
<BR>
up?
<BR>
