<P>
<EM>JE&gt; WRT the Mach64 Xserver not working on JENSEN: this is because JENSEN needs
</EM><BR>
<EM>JE&gt; special code in order for an Xserver to access its framebuffer memory, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>JE&gt; that code has only been provided for the S3 server. If curious, take a look
</EM><BR>
<EM>JE&gt; at the S3-related code in any of the latest XFree86 releases. [...]
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; I was unable to boot it up with this card. As I was saying I don't even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; see the srm console promp, because the screen &quot;running&quot; if the card is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; in the machine. I don't know if it is Jensen specific or not, but I can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; use it with an old 256K vga card.
</EM><BR>
<P>In fact, the Jensen seems to run fine with most old 8 Bit VGA boards.
<BR>
<P><EM>JE&gt; This problem is because the JENSEN console (at least the ones I'm familiar
</EM><BR>
<EM>JE&gt; with) did not have a BIOS emulator, but had specific code for the (small
</EM><BR>
<EM>JE&gt; number of) supported video options, among which, obviously, was NOT the
</EM><BR>
<EM>JE&gt; Mach64. Upgrading to the latest SRM firmware *may* help with the card, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>JE&gt; may break other things, making it impossible to boot LINUX. At least, this
</EM><BR>
<EM>JE&gt; is what I remember from axp-list postings; anyone care to comment?
</EM><BR>
<P>At least, the initialisation code of later SRM firmware versions than 1.7 does
<BR>
not work with the ELSA Winner 1000 (S3 928) in EISA mode, ISA mode seems to
<BR>
work, as well as both of them with ARC and NT.
<BR>
<P>There might be a small chance of getting this card to run, but I doubt that it
<BR>
would be more useful than any other VGA as long as nobody does the necessary
<BR>
modifications of the Mach64 X server.
<BR>
<P>Viele Grüße, Christoph
