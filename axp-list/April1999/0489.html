<EM>&gt; Yes, for a long time.  With different kernels from 2.0 and 2.2 series.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Works like a clockwork.  The only thing is that I am using consistently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a value of 4000k for shared memory buffers (a command line flag or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an environment variable) as a default 4M is tad too big for an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unmodified kernel on Alpha.  BTW - does anybody know good reasons for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this resource limit on Alpha?  Is this simply a &quot;tradition&quot;?  Intel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has much higher default.
</EM><BR>
<P>Do you ever use more than about 5% of the buffer? I am of the opinion that
<BR>
if you use more than about 25% then probably the machine is too overloaded
<BR>
to write CD's. I thought the buffer was just to allow for the occaisional
<BR>
bus bottleneck on slower machines - this shouldn't be a problem on the
<BR>
AXPs, but if like my machine, you haven't been bothered to compile in the
<BR>
DMA HDD transfers then you can get into a mess if the machine starts to
<BR>
swap a lot. A crashing Mozzilla is good for this.
<BR>
<P>I try to make sure that very few processes are running - in the HOWTO I
<BR>
seem to remember them suggesting disconnecting your machine from the
<BR>
network and stopping all user processes.
<BR>
<P>So I would say that the limit on shared memory is not really an issue,
<BR>
however, it has been discussed on this list many times in the past.
<BR>
<P>Phil.
