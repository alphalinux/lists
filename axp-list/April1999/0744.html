The Real answer to the problem is ,If we are not getting the service ,or the
<BR>
product has left the idea of Linux which it seems to have done. Let face it
<BR>
RedHat have set themselves up as the Leader as far as Linux is concerned.
<BR>
Anyway back to my Point If you dont Like it DONT BUY IT wait until someone
<BR>
else releases something as good or Better. By the way is 6.0 the one with
<BR>
the drivers for the high availability stuff ?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screw RedHat. Support your friendly software competitor.

<P>Sorry if this appears rude, but Red Hat is on my s-list this month.
