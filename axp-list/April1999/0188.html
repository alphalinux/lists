<EM>&gt; What is the equivalent of a rescue disk for AlphaLinux
</EM><BR>
<P>Your installation pair will do just fine.  Do not choose &quot;Install&quot; but
<BR>
&quot;Upgrage&quot;, and tell it that your stuff to install is on a hard disk -
<BR>
does not matter what. Once file systems are mounted switch to the
<BR>
second console (alt-F2) and you will have a shell.  It is not hard from
<BR>
there to mount a richer environment, from CD - for example - if you
<BR>
would feel constrained in this rather spartan one. :-)
<BR>
<P>If you feel like that you can hack a special ramdisk, with a different
<BR>
init sequence than the one which starts installation, but this is so
<BR>
rarely needed that hardly worth a bother.  Keep in mind that on Alpha once
<BR>
you loaded milo (say, from a floppy) you have much richer environment
<BR>
than provided by a typical bios on an Intel box.  You can, for example,
<BR>
load a spare kernel from the same FAT floppy from which you loaded milo,
<BR>
or from CD, supplying 'single' boot argument if something is haywire
<BR>
in your startup files; so starting into a ram disk is quite rare event
<BR>
when you managed to scramble your root file system to such extent that
<BR>
it is unmountable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (and Linux in general).
</EM><BR>
<P>In general this depends how you bootstrap a system on a given platform
<BR>
and this varies with a firmware.  On Alpha you have two different
<BR>
console types (plus variations) and details differ but priciples remain
<BR>
the same.
