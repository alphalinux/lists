Well, just so that no one goes out of their way to try to get me a
<BR>
root-fs floppy image... I've managed to get around my problem...
<BR>
forgot that the obvious way to get single user mode is:
<BR>
<P><EM>MILO&gt; boot sda3:vmlinux.gz single root=/dev....
</EM><BR>
<P>Anyways... I think it would be nice if there was a root floppy image
<BR>
around that can be used for emergencies...
<BR>
<P>I still have to figure out why I couldn't mount floppies as root...
<BR>
<P>Anyways, all is good now..
<BR>
<P>D.
