<P>
I just bought one of the PC164SX/533 motherboards recently auctioned off
<BR>
on eBay, and now I'm building a system around it.  Most of the options
<BR>
are fairly simple (floppy, CD), but I do have three questions about the
<BR>
motherboard, and so forth:
<BR>
<P>1)  These motherboards do NOT use ECC memory, correct?  The documentation
<BR>
for the motherboard certainly implies this.
<BR>
<P>2) Several memory vendors mention EPROM on the DIMM.  Do I, as a system
<BR>
builder, really care about this?  Or does the system take care of it?
<BR>
<P>3)  Does RedHat support IDE disks &gt; 8 GB?  I'm thinking about buying a 13.5
<BR>
GB disk, as they're not that much more expensive than the 6 GB disks that
<BR>
seem to be the bottom end disks.

Later, he was to decide that Andrew's life had been fractally weird. That
is, you could take any small piece of it and examine it in detail and it, in
and of itself, would turn out to be just as complicated and weird as the
whole thing in its entirety.
