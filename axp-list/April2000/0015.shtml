<EM>&gt; Ah that little one; some time after 2.3.5x things changed a bit.  Make a

<EM>&gt; directory /var/shm and add to your /etc/fstab the line:

<P>Great. When I go back to that series I'll do this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; One good thing. Promise UATA66 performance is good,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on the order of 20MB/sec for my Maxtor 40GB drive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it did find. It is unstable however. Locked as I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hmm that is good going. What does your onboard controller give with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same drive?
</EM><BR>
<P>As in the other thread, the onboard EIDE is the same
<BR>
as a 164sx it seems and is not a good performer, at
<BR>
least from what I've seen. A 40GB Maxtor is about 4MB/sec
<BR>
in DMA mode. Which DMA mode I don't know but I haven't
<BR>
seen a way to get it going faster yet.
<BR>
<P>I'm now running 2.2.15pre17 and it's behaving so far.
<BR>
Had a few patch rejects though but nothing affecting
<BR>
the HW I use.
<BR>
<P>Copied 30GB onto a disk on the Promise card and it's
<BR>
stayed up. Currently reading the data back. It's actually
<BR>
running very well, around 24MB/sec initially. I see this
<BR>
drive taper off to around 13MB/sec at the end. We'll see
<BR>
how it goes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; doesn't want to write past 8GB which I don't think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is the Promise's problem but then again, the Promise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reports the drive as an 8GB device so it might be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the Promise's fault.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The 8GB problem goes as follows.  In yee oldee days the discs were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specified by Cylinder/Head/Sector - but sense dawned on the face of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IDE community and they realised that was silly now. So all large drives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (should) return a CHS of 16383/16/63 (about 8GB) which is actually an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; indication to the BIOS/OS to ignore the CHS and just use the LBA sector
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; count.  If you do an hdparm -i on the drives you should see a CHS like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that but an LBAsects value which if multiplied by 512 gives you the real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; size of the drive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes. LBA looks fine. C/H/S is nonsense.
