Hi.


After compiling XFree86 version4.0, I noticed that Voodoo3 seems

to be supported because their drivers are compiled. Interestingly,

DRI is supporting this card as well.


Does someone already tried Voodoo2 or Voodoo3 card with alpha ?

I'd like to know how good it is. I also want to know where one can

find more detailed documentation. (Very little is found under xfree86

4.0 tree).
