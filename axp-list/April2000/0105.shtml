<EM>&gt; &gt; I wish there where something slower than DS10. Something EV6 based

<EM>&gt; &gt; course alot cheaper. Something that could knock a Sun Ultra 5 out of the

<EM>&gt; Something slower than the DS10 would not be cheaper; the motherboard chipset
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is quite expensive, and a slower CPU doesn't save any money there. As for

<EM>&gt; AGP, wishing won't make it so.

<P>The UP2000 uses an expensive chip set, UP1000 doesn't.
<BR>
The price difference between a UP2000 and UP1000 board 
<BR>
is large. A UP2000 board is over 3x what a UP1000  goes 
<BR>
for. Of course it does 2 cpus and has built-in SCSI so 
<BR>
it should be more.
<BR>
<P>For the UP1000. You can get a motherboard(~$700) and 
<BR>
600mhz cpu(~$2000) for $2700 total last I looked. 
<BR>
That's as cheap as I've seen. Of course, you have to supply
<BR>
the case, memory, disk, etc. and assemble it. Note the
<BR>
cpu is the expensive part here. If API had a slower part,
<BR>
say 500mhz, that would fit the bill, assuming they were
<BR>
to price them a bit lower than the 600mhz part.
<BR>
<P>If anyone's selling UP1000 processors for substantially less, 
<BR>
contact me offline. I'd like to hear about it. I thought a 
<BR>
previous discussion indicated UP1000 processors were cheaper 
<BR>
than that but that's not what I've found.
