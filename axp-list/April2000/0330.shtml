That is correct I havent installed anything on an alpha previously.
<BR>
<P>I have a copy of the cd and have been using 
<BR>
boot fd0:vmlinux.gz root=/dev/scd0
<BR>
<P>I got this from the redhat installation page, is this wrong?

<P><P>I see, So you've probably never installed an OS on an Alpha.

probably

Alphabios?
<BR>
<P>You can delete, create, and format partitions from within Alphabios.
<BR>
Simply press F2 when you reach the Alphabios and when it is done
<BR>
initializing it will enter the setup. I forget the name of the line item
<BR>
but you'll figure out which item to select to manage the disk. Once there,
<BR>
delete it and confirm it. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If so that would probably solve my problem, can i then go and copy my cd

to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the hard drive through the alphabios or how would i go about doing that.
</EM><BR>
is
<BR>
<EM>&gt; there a howto somewhere that im just not seeing?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm curious...
<BR>
How are actually installing this.
<BR>
You must be able to initalize the boot process in some way.
<BR>
<P>The boot string for milo if you're using floppies should be
<BR>
<P>boot fd0:/generic.gz root=/dev/fd0 load_ramdisk=1
<BR>
<P>once it's finished booting the kernel it will ask you to insert the
<BR>
ramdisk and press enter. Do that and after a minute you'll be in the 
<BR>
RH installer.
<BR>
<P>If you have a CD you could boot right from the CD and start the install
<BR>
like so, assuming you IDE hardware. If you have SCSI use sda instead of
<BR>
hda etc etc. 
<BR>
<P>boot hcd0:/boot/generic.gz root=/dev/hcd0
<BR>
<P>and you'll be in the graphical X install, If for some reason you 
<BR>
want to do a text based install simply put &quot; text &quot; at the end of 
<BR>
the line.Good luck.
