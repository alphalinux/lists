<P>
Does anyone on the list have the real scoop on XP1000 power supplies?
<BR>
We've got a cluster of 35 of the 667 mhz variety with no video and have
<BR>
lost 20 power supplies.  Until recently, there were no repeats.  For
<BR>
awhile, the story was 'they must be getting too hot in your
<BR>
installation, but we'll fix it.  If it continues we'll have to call our
<BR>
engineer out to look at the environment.&quot;  Then the story became a bad
<BR>
lot of power supplies during assembly.  This one made sense when there
<BR>
were no repeats.  Now I'm hearing it may have been a bad design.
<BR>
<P>Does anyone know the scoop?
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
Todd
