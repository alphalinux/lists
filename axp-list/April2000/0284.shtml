<P><EM>&gt; It looks like someone cracked their site twice this week.  It makes me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wonder if there _is_ an admin, there seems to be no effort to take down the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;I cracked this site, I wus h3r3&quot; messages.
</EM><BR>
<P>This leads me to not want to bother with even attempting to correct the
<BR>
article.  Given the way the site's set up and how it's administered, who's
<BR>
going to take the article seriously anyway?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I couldn't stand reading the article as the grammar was at least as bad as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some posts to other lists that I am on.  
</EM><BR>
<P>The way I see it, an &quot;article&quot; like that should read as if the author was
<BR>
submitting it to a magazine for publication.  It's a little different than a
<BR>
mailing list posting or a personal communication, as presumably the author has
<BR>
actually invested more time than the few minutes it takes to fire off an e-mail
<BR>
in the preparation of the article.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I am curious if the writer needs to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take an ESL course.  I'm not joking, and I'm not trying to be offensive.
</EM><BR>
<P>As someone who used to teach a freshman chemistry lab (and who had to suffer
<BR>
through grading student lab reporst), I can say I've seen papers that were just
<BR>
as poorly written from native English speakers.  However, because of the nature
<BR>
of some of the mistakes, I'm inclined to agree with you that the writer's
<BR>
native language is probably not English.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The whole page seems to be about intentionally messing up the grammar so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the reader has no clue what the point is.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know if it's intentional, but the way the article is written is
<BR>
certainly a barrier to communication.  How can we possibly provide constructive
<BR>
criticism if we can't figure out what the author is trying to say in the first
<BR>
place?
