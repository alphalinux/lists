<P>Good - I'd really like to know if anyone gets any better.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Flakiness worries me. I've noticed that 2.2.14 with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IDE-DMA patches does not handle large IDE disk on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Promise card correctly. It bails out between 8-9GB on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my tests with FS corruption. My understanding was the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.3.xx series had better large IDE disk support.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've not had problems with 2.2.x or 2.3.x with this drive; except for the
<BR>
fact that there is a known bug in eary 2.3.'s and most 2.2.'s (not sure
<BR>
when it was fixed) that it couldn't cope with IDE drives over 32GB.
<BR>
I've not had corruption problems and I've had the drive since June last
<BR>
year; although I don't run with particularly large partitions.
<BR>
<P>My gut feeling would be not to use the Promise.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Given &gt; an Alpha has more interupts than an x86, I'd like to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; put 6-8 large IDE disks on a system for data storage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using add-on ATA66 cards.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm - mean system!  At work we have an external EIDE RAID box which chucks
<BR>
SCSI out the back; I don't know the manufacturer, but it takes 6 IDE
<BR>
drives (we use the IBM 34 GXPs) - standard drives as far as I'm aware.  I
<BR>
think it was about #4000 UKP when we bought them about 6 months ago.
<BR>
Might be worth looking to see if any of your suppliers have anything
<BR>
similar.
<BR>
<P>Another thing to look at is CPU usage; I don't know how much this would be
<BR>
different on a nice juicy UP2K, but on my LX:
<BR>
<P>time dd if=/dev/hdc of=/dev/null bs=1024k count=100
<BR>
<P>gives:
<BR>
<P>0.00user 1.54system 0:08.71elapsed 17%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata
<BR>
0maxresident)k
<BR>
0inputs+0outputs (97major+145minor)pagefaults 0swaps
<BR>
<P>Another thing to remember is that the data transfer rate can vary
<BR>
significantly over the surface of the disc.
