<P>
<EM>&gt; How did you format the drive ahead of time?  
</EM><BR>
I didn't.
<BR>
<P>During the installation, I let it format the drives. Then, B4 letting
<BR>
him install,
<BR>
I went to the console, and did a mke2fs /dev/sda2 -b 1024 -O none . This
<BR>
formats
<BR>
the partition the way I want to have it. I then aborted the installation
<BR>
and 
<BR>
started again. This time I didn't let mandrake format /dev/sda2. It
<BR>
worked for me.
<BR>
<P>If you try to format the drive B4 the mandrake installer formats it, the
<BR>
/dev/sda2
<BR>
entries might not be there.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have tried formatting using a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; redhat text install to get a shell. It doesn't let me format it.  It was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; formated by DrakX(the installer?) as a supersparse. Why are you using milo and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the alphbios instead of the SRM?
</EM><BR>
1) I've always used it, and haven't had major issues with it.
<BR>
2) SRM complains about an &quot;unknown / illegal device in slot 5&quot; which is
<BR>
my Matrox
<BR>
M2.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The alphabios takes longer to boot and the PAL code isn't updated like it is for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the SRM. Just curious why you chose it.
</EM><BR>
I'd like to try SRM, but don't know how to solve the prob. with my VGA
<BR>
card. Do
<BR>
you have any idea if for instance a Voodoo 3 3000 does work?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is there any way to get the drive set so that aboot can read it and so that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the installer will work.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I forgot to mention from above that after I formated using redhat's format
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from their installer (which will work with aboot), the Mandrake installer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cannot mount /mnt/var/?/rpm/?  (I can't remember the path exactly - if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; necessary I can get it again) and gets stuck in a loop returning to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; package selector again.  Any ideas?  Thanks.
</EM><BR>
Please try the method I mentioned above &amp; let me know how it goes... It
<BR>
worked
<BR>
for me (did it on saturday).
<BR>
<P>Stefan
