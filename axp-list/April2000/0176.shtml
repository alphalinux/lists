<P>qmail is a good server, I have it installed on a box running as a list server. 
<BR>
It lacks imap support  so you may have to use one of several alternatives. 
<BR>
I liked Cyrus but it really needs to run a closed box.  I have UW-imap on a
<BR>
production server with PHP4 and Horde/IMP for web access.  There were several
<BR>
things I had to fix however.  PHP's imap module had a bug in the delete
<BR>
routines and I also applied the imap-maildir patch to fix the user maildir
<BR>
problems.  With a little tweaking and experimentation I had the beast up and
<BR>
running.  The only other consideration of course is the use of a secure httpd. 
<BR>
This however, is another challenge that you need to overcome.
