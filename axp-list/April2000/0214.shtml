<EM>&gt; &gt; Yes, it has. The fix just hasn't made it into the official distribution
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; since no-one could agree on the proper way to handle it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I made one patch which parses /proc/cpuinfo to find out the machine it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is running on and selects the addressing scheme accordingly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Couldn't you just grab that info from the hwrpb?  Or is that kernel-access
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only... (thinking too much again...)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; An improved version of that patch relied on the pciconfig_iobase
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; syscall, added by rth for 2.3.99-preXX, but this also never got anywhere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; since it didn't quite fit into the scheme the powers that be had in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; mind.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What was the problem that the &quot;powers that be&quot; had?  (And which powers that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be?)  I'm just curious...

<P>Unfortunately there is a rather nasty combination you need to look for
<BR>
between CPU revisions and chipset revisions.  Some chipsets will work
<BR>
while others won't, including various revisions of the same chipsets.
<BR>
It sounded like a mess to have to deal with and no one seemed to come
<BR>
up with something that handled all the corner cases so nothing was
<BR>
excepted.  If I have time next week, I'll have to try the patch that
<BR>
was sent here.  On my system at home (Athlon with a G400), XFree86 4.0
<BR>
was probably 2-3 times faster than the 3.3.x code.  It would be nice
<BR>
to be able speed up my Miata at work.  The powers that be are those
<BR>
that work on the Alpha code in the XFree86 project.
