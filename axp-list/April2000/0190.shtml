One of my UP2K's seems to have a problem. It locked up
<BR>
and I had to power cycle it yesterday. When it came back
<BR>
up, it took me a while to notice performance was bad and
<BR>
I looked around to find out the kernel only brought up a
<BR>
single processor instead of two! So, since I had some code
<BR>
running, I waited until today to reboot. I shut it down,
<BR>
popped the cover and reseated the processors in case there
<BR>
was a problem there and then started it back up. At that
<BR>
point, SRM using &quot;show config&quot; identified both processors
<BR>
as there. When I booted though, I got a message something like:
<BR>
<P>CPU 1 Unable to complete console transition mode 1
<BR>
CPU 1 start=some_big_number  end=another_big_number difference=the_difference
<BR>
<P>CPU 1 Unable to complete console transition mode 2
<BR>
CPU 1 (different big numbers)
<BR>
<P>Then, it finally booted and Linux showed:
<BR>
<P>SMP: 2 CPUs probed -- cpu_present_mask = 3
<BR>
<P>and
<BR>
<P>SMP starting up secondaries.
<BR>
SMP: Processor 1 failed to start.
<BR>
SMP: Only one lonely processor alive.
<BR>
<P>So, it seems the second processor was not a happy camper.
<BR>
<P>I did swap processors between slots and it did boot OK
<BR>
without the errors but a couple hours ago it hung again 
<BR>
and I had to swap the processors back before I got a blue 
<BR>
screen again and it gives the same errors as above. Any 
<BR>
ideas whether it's really the cpu or maybe the motherboard 
<BR>
has problems??
<BR>
<P>Anyone else seen this??
<BR>
<P>Any info appreciated.
