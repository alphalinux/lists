<P>
I have a problem with getting my ethernet connected.  I have configured the 
<BR>
file and the system brings it up, but I can't connect to 
<BR>
anything.  ifconfig shows that I am recieving packets, but anytime I try to 
<BR>
ping a name or an IP address, it says unknown host.
<BR>
RX packets: 4935
<BR>
TX packets:0
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have configured the addresses of the nameservers too.  I know the 
<BR>
ethernet connection works, I know the addresses I have are correct.  I have 
<BR>
a cheapo system with a Davicom 9102 ethernet card, and I am running RedHat 
<BR>
6.2.  The system doesn't support it, but I compiled a driver and installed 
<BR>
it.  I also have a NetGear card that I am running as eth1.  Both are using 
<BR>
tulip as the interface.
<BR>
Please let me know if you have any suggestions.  I have been working on 
<BR>
this forever.
<BR>
Thanks.
