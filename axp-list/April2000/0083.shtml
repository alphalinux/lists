<P>
This is a problem which perhaps should be put in the 
<BR>
AlphaLinux FAQ. Excuse if it perhaps was discussed already.
<BR>
<P>I observed that XEmacs crashed apparently doing certain
<BR>
regexp matches. I got to extract a BibTeX record which 
<BR>
crashes XEmacs safely.
<BR>
<P>A similar, perhaps the same problem has been observed
<BR>
for XEmacs under OSF/1, which has only a 2MB stack. 
<BR>
As one XEmacs maintainer commented: &quot;Please check the
<BR>
ulimits for your stacksize. There seems to be a trend 
<BR>
on 64-bit OS to set it ridiculously low.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Although it is not confirmed completely, the problem
<BR>
really seems to be a stack overflow, because if I increase
<BR>
the stack limit XEmacs runs as always. (The standard stack
<BR>
size limit for my distribution is 8MB.) The problem may be 
<BR>
triggered by the use  of the alloca() function in the XEmacs 
<BR>
regexp matching code.
<BR>
<P>Other people have observed similar problems under Alpha Linux
<BR>
with different software.
<BR>
<P>The quick check is to become root, issue 
<BR>
<P>ulimit -s 32768
<BR>
<P>(or whatever value in kB), su to a user shell and start the
<BR>
program in question again.
<BR>
<P>To get higher limits by default, it seems necessary to write them
<BR>
in /etc/security/limits.conf, and also to set them with
<BR>
the ulimit shell command in the startup scripts for the
<BR>
daemons like sshd or atd. Stack limits are inherited by
<BR>
the parent processes and so each parent daemon has to 
<BR>
be restarted.
<BR>
<P>If my assumption matches the true cause for the problem, 
<BR>
it would seem reasonable that distributors increase stack 
<BR>
size limits for the alpha.
<BR>
<P>Would you agree about this ? Why might a program need more
<BR>
stack when running on the alpha?
<BR>
