Hi,
<BR>
<P>I've got a problem getting Glut compiled on my SX and I'm looking for
<BR>
ideas from people who have done it already.
<BR>
<P>To start with, I played with Mesa/Glut on my Slackware 4.0 and they
<BR>
installed and worked without problems, but the hard drive has recently
<BR>
passed away, so I can't look at a running version at the moment :-(
<BR>
<P>I took both lib and demos from <A HREF="http://www.mesa3d.org/download.html">http://www.mesa3d.org/download.html</A>
<BR>
and I went so far as to successfully install Mesa 3.1. However,
<BR>
&quot;make check&quot; produces errors - approximately dozen of gl* functions
<BR>
not found in a freshly compiled Mesa libs. I'm not around my Alpha
<BR>
at the moment, but I remember that aaindex.c is compiled and
<BR>
aaindex.o is created, but the next (second in compilation) file is
<BR>
stuck (in /Mesa-3.1/src/glu-src or some such).
<BR>
<P>I've just checked alaska archives and I found postings about a
<BR>
successful
<BR>
complations of (presumably only ?) Mesa, not sure about Glut, but before
<BR>
<P>I'll grab those I'd be willing to spent a bit of time trying on my own.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for any hints,
<BR>
Regards,
<BR>
<P>Andrei
