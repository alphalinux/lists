<P>
I don't know if yours actually is a 2.88MB drive, but I wouldn't be surprised.  Digital started using them in their alpha systems back in the ev4 days.
<BR>
<P>Yes,  2.88MB floppy drives require different media to write 2.88MB disks.  They are reffered to as ED, 2.88MB formated, 4.0MB unformated disks.  You will probably find it difficult to find any.  These were created around the time cdroms were becoming popular and before any of the zips.   They were expensive.  Then the software industry moved to cdroms and there was no driving force to push adoption of hardware.
<BR>
<P>If you find a source for the disks at a reasonable price, I would be interested. 
<BR>

When I boot one of my UP2000s I get the following message displayed.
<BR>
<P>Apr  8 20:20:15 linux3 kernel: Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 2.88M
<BR>
<P>So is this really a 2.88MB floppy unit ?
<BR>
<P>I've looked at floppy.c in the kernel and there copied the floppy_struct info
<BR>
from there into /etc/fdprm and then done;
<BR>
<P>setfdprm -p /dev/fd0 2880/2880
<BR>
<P>But when I fdformat it it says;
<BR>
<P>fdformat /dev/fd0
<BR>
Double-sided, 80 tracks, 36 sec/track. Total capacity 2880 kB.
<BR>
Formatting ... done
<BR>
Verifying ... Read: : Input/output error
<BR>
Problem reading cylinder 0, expected 36864, read -1
<BR>
<P><P>Do I need to buy 2.88MB floppy media for this to work ?
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
Addy.
