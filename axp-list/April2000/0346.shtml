<EM>&gt; I doubt

<EM>&gt; de4x5.c can handle the new fa310tx cards.

<P>Most likely you are right in these doubts (but Netgear had so many
<BR>
variations that it is hard to be sure of anything with these cards :-).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time, I'll try my normal kernel level (2.2.14) and see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if it behaves better than RH's version of 2.2.13. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Essential fixes, including a fix to a long standing bug in skbuf
<BR>
handling (this locks up NIC under a heavy traffic and affects likely
<BR>
all drivers from Donald Becker), were done in 2.2.15pre series.
<BR>
The current 2.2.15pre19 is for all purposes the same as 2.2.15
<BR>
but it is still waiting for &quot;non possum&quot; from Linus so it is &quot;pre&quot;.
<BR>
<P>A &quot;2.2.14&quot; kernel from Red Hat 6.2 distribution is really roughly
<BR>
2.2.15pre11 (IIRC) plus updates to RAID support plus some other patches
<BR>
which were included, or subsumed, by later kernels from 2.2.15pre
<BR>
series.  This kernel may also include an updated tulip driver but I did
<BR>
not check precisely which version is really that.
<BR>
<P>You will find in the latest kernels 'de4x5', 'old_tulip' and 'tulip'
<BR>
drivers.  There are various tulip cards which will work with all three
<BR>
of those (I have such card, for example) or with only two or maybe with
<BR>
only one.  This depends on differences in transmitters (an maybe also in
<BR>
an autonegotiation sequence); various manufacturers did assorted
<BR>
&quot;improvements&quot; to a design one time or another.  'old_tulip' driver is
<BR>
supposed to be redundant in the current 2.2.15pre, and is included only
<BR>
as a safety measure, but it may turn out that this precaution is vital
<BR>
to somebody with some particular model of card.  Time will tell. :-)
<BR>
<P>I know that this may be confusing but &quot;Tulip&quot; is really a sizeable
<BR>
family of cards with varying characteristics with quite a bit of
<BR>
this stuff not really ever published as technical specs.  If you think
<BR>
that with other NICs the situation is better you may be for a surprise. :-)
