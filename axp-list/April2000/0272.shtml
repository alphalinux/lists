<P>
<EM>&gt; I am not a total idiot,
</EM><BR>
<P>Nobody ever implied that.  We all have our difficulties.
<BR>
You seem to like to gloss over small &quot;insignificant&quot; details. :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; 0:1/vmlinuz-2.2.14-6.0 root=/dev/sdb1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This will be '0:1/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.14-6.0
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; root=/dev/sdb1'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As in b dbq1 -fi 0:1/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.14-6.0 -fl
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;root=/dev/sdb1&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<P>If you are trying to boot from /dev/sdb1 (the first partition of
<BR>
the second SCSI disk) then for SRM this likely will be dkb100 and
<BR>
not dbq1.  What it really is it depends on its SCSI id.
<BR>
<P>SRM console was not created for Linux and it is using different
<BR>
device nomenclature.  It is a minor PITA but this is a fact of life.
<BR>
It **is** important to look at what 'show dev' brings.  This will
<BR>
list all you recognized devices with names as recognized by SRM
<BR>
and identifying strings.  I am afraid that I cannot do that for
<BR>
you and I never seen that system so I am only guessing here.
<BR>
<P>If you attempt to boot from ATAPI CD then use a kernel from this CD
<BR>
and give root on your system disk.  It would really help to know
<BR>
what exactly you are trying to do;  other then these minor details
<BR>
your boot line looks fine. :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Actually an installer probably wrote for you a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; correct /etc/aboot.conf
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; but you neet a bootblock written with 'swriteblock'.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How do I do this?
</EM><BR>
<P>You type 'swriteboot' (my typo above) and it comes back with a usage. :-)
<BR>
You will see:
<BR>
Usage: swriteboot [-f[1-8]] [-v] disk bootfile [kernel]
<BR>
<P>Your &quot;bootfile&quot; will likely be in /boot/bootlx and a &quot;disk&quot; is something
<BR>
like /dev/sda, or /dev/sdb, or /dev/hdc, or ... .  Are you sure that
<BR>
installer did not have done already that for you?  Don't worry about
<BR>
optional parts for the while.
<BR>
<P>Actually there is quite quite a bit of a documentation (not without
<BR>
minor gaps, unfortunately) in '/usr/doc/aboot...'.  Look at 'srm.txt'
<BR>
in particular.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;  Also you should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; use 'abootconf' to configure which partition holds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; your 'aboot.conf'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; file.  Then, after you set in SRM 'boot_dev', you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; boot like that &quot;b -fl
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 0&quot; or simply &quot;b&quot; if your 'boot_flags' are empty or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; zero.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This sounds like something even I can do.
</EM><BR>
<P>When you set in SRM 'auto_action' to BOOT instead of HALT (do not do
<BR>
that yet until you sorted out everything) then your system will boot
<BR>
automatically on a power up using parameters from an entry labelled
<BR>
'0' in 'aboot.conf'.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; You can always boot for the first time using your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; floppy and/or CD.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Once you have a system running it is much easier to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sort all these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; details.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How do I do this. I was not given an option to make a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boot floppy at all during the install process.
</EM><BR>
<P>This &quot;boot floppy&quot; it is one of these two you made from images in
<BR>
'images' directory on CD (and, obviously, not a ram disk :-).  Assuming
<BR>
your root file system is on /dev/sdb1 - stick it in a drive and type
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b dva0 -fi vmlinux.gz -fl &quot;root=/dev/sdb1&quot;
<BR>
<P>I thought that I wrote you something like that before.
<BR>
<P>You have tools for making floppies with ext2 file system on them
<BR>
('e2writeboot') and CD images ('isomarkboot') bootable from SRM.
<BR>
<P>Remember that you already booted Linux or you would not install
<BR>
anything. :-)
<BR>
