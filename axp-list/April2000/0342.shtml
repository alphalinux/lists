Hi, I'm looking for memory for an XL300, but coming up against a couple
<BR>
of problems. 
<BR>
<P>After a tedious process which involved special ordering memory and
<BR>
discovering that despite being the type specified (64MB 70ns true parity
<BR>
SIMMs) they still didn't work (beeps on startup indicate &quot;memory
<BR>
error&quot;). 
<BR>
<P>What is the relation between an XL300 and a &quot;Celebris&quot; machine?  I'm
<BR>
looking at some Kingston memory part # KTV-PZX/256, which I think is the
<BR>
proper part for 4 64MB SIMMs, but the Kingston web page says it's for a
<BR>
&quot;Celebris XL300&quot;.  Can anyone confirm that this is the right part? 
<BR>
<P>I noticed that the Kingston memory already in the machine has tin
<BR>
contacts, and the new ones I tried were gold.  I hadn't heard of this
<BR>
making a big difference, but then I guess alphas can be more sensitive. 
<BR>
<P>So if I spring for the memory, how long do these machines last
<BR>
(physically)?  I've heard of capacitors and other parts failing in cheap
<BR>
PC motherboards, but I assume one of these DEC machines should be able
<BR>
to run for years.  Part of me balks at buying new &quot;obsolete&quot; memory, but
<BR>
otoh I don't feel the need to get a new machine, and although the memory
<BR>
is expensive, it's not as expensive as getting a new machine. 
<BR>
<P>So I guess the question boils down to: is the Kingston part number
<BR>
correct, and is there a cheaper source for memory that will work, from
<BR>
people who know about alphas?  I don't want to go through that cycle
<BR>
(which ended up taking a total of over 3 weeks) again!  XL300's seem to
<BR>
be reasonably common; where are people getting the memory? 
<BR>
<P>thanks,
<BR>
Wes.
