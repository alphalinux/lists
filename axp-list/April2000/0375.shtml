Hi,
<BR>
we've just noticed that the performance of DEC500 Tulip cards running under
<BR>
RH6.1 (2.2.14 kernel) is pretty awful.
<BR>
Basically we are getting ~140K Bytes/s (1.4e+02) through a 100TX switch when
<BR>
doing point-point ftp transfers and network boots are failing. The switch we are
<BR>
using is an Intel Express 460T.
<BR>
<P>The strange thing is that using the same nodes and cables and connecting them to
<BR>
a simple 100TX hub we get 11000 K Bytes/s (1.1e+04)
<BR>
We also have 3com 100TX cards in these nodes and we have found that we can
<BR>
achieve 7900 K bytes/s (7.9e+03) when they are connected to the Intel switch.
<BR>
<P>The switch is reporting large numbers of errors on the ports connected to the
<BR>
Tulip cards; mostly Fragment errors (Frames which are less than 64-bytes and/or
<BR>
frames without a start-of-frame). But there are also CRC errors (valid length
<BR>
frames &gt; 64 bytes which have an FCS error)
<BR>
I have also observed poor performance when connecting the Tulip cards to a 3com
<BR>
Super Stack switch.
<BR>
<P>So my guess is that the Tulip device driver is generating bad frames that are
<BR>
being ignored by hubs but are being dropped by switches. Has anyone else
<BR>
observed this behaviour ? Is there a fix ?
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
Addy.
