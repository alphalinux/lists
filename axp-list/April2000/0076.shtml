Sounds possible.  The site would need to have some disclaimer/warning that the articles are not verified if you use the anybody can post scheme.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
I've thought about this too but I did not have any sources I would consider 1st or 2nd line.  Nor did I have the time for this every day.  If we can get several people together and the site can be known as the source that alpha owners/interested parties go to check out it could grab the vendors attention so that they keep them informed.
<BR>
<P>I might even be willing to help a little.

<BR>
I do use alphalinux.org

<EM>&gt; the time it takes somebody to write up the news items everytime.

<P>Perhaps we could use some of the Open Sourced code used on Kuro5hin.org,

I believe the project is called &quot;scoop&quot;. One of the features is that the
<BR>
*users* get to decide what gets posted. This would make the site
<BR>
*almost* self maintained. Then only editors to fix spelling, broken
<BR>
urls, etc would be needed. What does everyone think?

<P>P.S. as far as volunteers go, where do I sigh up? ;)
