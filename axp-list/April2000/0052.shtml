<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for the help everyone.  I finally have it running.  It seems that it was
<BR>
the name of the kernel that made the difference.  When you boot from floppy
<BR>
to install, you use vmlinuz but booting from disk after install uses vmlinux.
<BR>
I was wondering if someone could update the SRM how-to in the &quot;Installation
<BR>
of Distribution&quot; section for RedHat 6.1.
<BR>
<P>When booting from floppy to install from CD, you use the following if you have
<BR>
a SCSI CD.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; boot dva0 -file vmlinuz.gz -flags &quot;root=/dev/scd0 text expert&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>and after you install, boot as follows 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; set boot_file 3/vmlinux-2.2.13-0.9
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; set boot_osflags root=/dev/sda4
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; boot dka0
</EM><BR>
<P>or 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; boot dka0 -file 3/vmlinux-2.2.13-0.9 -flags &quot;root=/dev/sda4&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that my example is a SCSI based system with my kernel on partition 3(/boot) and my
<BR>
root directory on partition 4(/).  Reading the stuff at the following link helped but
<BR>
it took forever to find it.  It was under the &quot;Linux Documentation section&quot; and not
<BR>
located or a link from the &quot;Support and install documentation&quot;.
<BR>
&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/support/manuals/RHL-6.1-Manual/install-alpha/multi-arch/s1-alpha-srminstalls.html">http://www.redhat.com/support/manuals/RHL-6.1-Manual/install-alpha/multi-arch/s1-alpha-srminstalls.html</A>
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that I have it running, it doesn't seem to be as fast as I expected.  What kind
<BR>
of performance should I expect from an AS 400 4/166. What would be its Intel based
<BR>
equivalent.
<BR>
<P>Thanks everyone.
<BR>
Greg.
