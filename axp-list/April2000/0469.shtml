-The 2100 with either EV4 or EV5 cpus work.  They have 8 EISA slots and 3 PCI slots.
<BR>
-The 2100A with either EV4 or EV5 is not currently supported.  This system has 8 PCI slots and 3 EISA slots.  There are other differences but this is the most noticable.  This hardware architecture has not been worked out and support developed.

I also happen to have a 2100 (Not &quot;A&quot;), either a Sable or Gamma-Sable
<BR>
<P>I thought as they were both old systems that I had a better chance with the
<BR>
newer of the 2 machines, and plus it offered bonuses like PCI as well as
<BR>
EISA.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, RH 6.2 booted up fine off the Floppy.
<BR>
<P>BTW, is there anyone who can follow on from David's comment?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; If someone more knowledgeable on this part of DEC's product line could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; comment on this it would be greatly appreciated.
</EM><BR>
<P>It would be nice to convert the 2100 from a doorstop to a useful machine.
