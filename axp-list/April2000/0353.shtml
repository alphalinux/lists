<EM>&gt; &gt;I started up my PC164 and upgraded it to RH6.1. It is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;indeed unstable with the tulip.c that comes pre-built
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What happened?  Did the system just freeze?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Ping worked, ftp worked, but an NFS mount hung the PC164
<BR>
solid and I had to hit the reset button. It would seem 
<BR>
somehow UDP triggers the problem but TCP doesn't or just
<BR>
pure chance?
<BR>
<P>de4x5 and old_tulip don't show this problem, at least in
<BR>
the past 10 hours or so. Michal's explanation of a buggy
<BR>
driver sounds like a prime candidate to try the latest 
<BR>
2.2.15pre kernel since it has changes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; from RH for 2.2.13. I don't use 2.2.13 on any systems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; so that's not a kernel I'm interested in working with.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; But, I did switch from tulip.c to de4x5.c since the card
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is a real 21140 chip. That actually works fine. I can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; access all my other systems without trouble. I doubt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; de4x5.c can handle the new fa310tx cards. As I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; time, I'll try my normal kernel level (2.2.14) and see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; if it behaves better than RH's version of 2.2.13.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I eventually had problems with de4x5, and other non-DEC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cards also.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My systems don't freeze right away.  I have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; put a load on the CPU for a while.   Compiling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mozilla seemed to freeze one system reliably.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sometimes just rapidly moving the mouse over several
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; windows at boot time could do it.
</EM><BR>
<P>That sounds like a kernel bug to me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ..........
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When I pull the ethernet card, the systems don't freeze.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't plan on putting a load on this box. It's been
<BR>
turned off for about 10 months because it's too slow
<BR>
for what I do and has no useful peripherals attached.
<BR>
No point wasting the watts. I have a PC164LX I still
<BR>
use as a data gateway (tape drives).
<BR>
<P>As to pulling the card, that would make a machine useless
<BR>
to me.
