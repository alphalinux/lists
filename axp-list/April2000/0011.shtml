<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Good - I'd really like to know if anyone gets any better.
</EM><BR>
<P>Some progress. I put together 2.3.99pre4.
<BR>
<P>Compilation is troublesome but if you don't select
<BR>
the new net filtering code, it builds.
<BR>
<P>Odd things when it booted:
<BR>
<P>1. It loses the floppy drive. 2.2.14 finds it fine.
<BR>
2. It loses the IDE drive on the secondary channel of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Promise card. It does report the channel exists.
<BR>
3. I tried a hdparm -Tt /dev/hda and it says the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SHM file system is not mounted?? I did select
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SYSV IPC which is where I believe SHM lives.
<BR>
<P>One good thing. Promise UATA66 performance is good,
<BR>
on the order of 20MB/sec for my Maxtor 40GB drive
<BR>
it did find. It is unstable however. Locked as I
<BR>
attempted to copy around 30GB of data from a disk
<BR>
on the Cypress IDE to the Promise. I'm not sure
<BR>
which side locked up though. The Promise has been
<BR>
stable so far under 2.2.14, excluding the fact it
<BR>
doesn't want to write past 8GB which I don't think
<BR>
is the Promise's problem but then again, the Promise
<BR>
reports the drive as an 8GB device so it might be
<BR>
the Promise's fault.
<BR>
<P>I think I'm going to try a 2.2.15pre/ac level and
<BR>
see how that does. At least it seems the Promise
<BR>
is capable of a reasonable speed. Now if it can
<BR>
only run stable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Hmm - mean system!  At work we have an external EIDE RAID box which chucks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SCSI out the back; I don't know the manufacturer, but it takes 6 IDE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drives (we use the IBM 34 GXPs) - standard drives as far as I'm aware.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think it was about #4000 UKP when we bought them about 6 months ago.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Might be worth looking to see if any of your suppliers have anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; similar.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I've seen them but the box itself raises the cost
<BR>
almost to the same price as SCSI so it didn't seem
<BR>
like a good deal. My main interest is $/MB. I regularly
<BR>
fiddle around with several 100GB of data and at times
<BR>
more than one set of data so it consumes lots of disk
<BR>
space.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Another thing to look at is CPU usage; I don't know how much this would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different on a nice juicy UP2K, but on my LX:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time dd if=/dev/hdc of=/dev/null bs=1024k count=100
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gives:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 0.00user 1.54system 0:08.71elapsed 17%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 0maxresident)k
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 0inputs+0outputs (97major+145minor)pagefaults 0swaps
</EM><BR>
<P>I suspect an EV67 can cut the cpu utilization significantly. 
<BR>
Even SCSI consumes a substantial amount of cpu as the disk speed 
<BR>
increases. Still, though, it's limited by the 100BT.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Another thing to remember is that the data transfer rate can vary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; significantly over the surface of the disc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup, on the order of 50%/100% or so depending on how
<BR>
you look at it. My Maxtors go from about 13MB/sec to 
<BR>
24MB/sec.
