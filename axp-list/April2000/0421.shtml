<P>
Make sure that you aren't using all three connectors at the same time (ie 2
<BR>
int, 1 ext) -- this will cause a problem.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Disconnections&quot; is how SCSI implements concurrent I/O operations.  If you
<BR>
disable SCSI disconnects for a device then the device will &quot;remain on the
<BR>
bus&quot; throughout the entire I/O cycle until the operation is complete.  If it
<BR>
is an I/O that involves a seek and takes a while, the bus is unavailable to
<BR>
other devices.  With devices such as tape drives it is essential that you
<BR>
allow disconnects otherwise the whole bus may be rendered &quot;hung&quot; while a
<BR>
long operation such as rewind (non-immediate) are performed.

<P><P><P>My HD are U2W (well, that's what I understant from IBM docs) but I use them
<BR>
(without any converter) as UW drives.
<BR>
<P>Well, the DigitalScape 885 uses a Sym53C885 chipset.
<BR>
<P>I just make a simple test : I disconnect my CD drives. And Linux still shows
<BR>
that my HD are detected as FAST-Wide.
<BR>
<P>I don't understand since the card detects the drives as UltraWide.
<BR>
<P>I also would like to know what does the disconnect option is about. The
<BR>
adapter doc isn't helpful.
