Well, the whole day gone, nothing worked. I have
<BR>
installed the OS about 5 times now and every time it
<BR>
goes just fine, and it proceeds to fail on reboot.
<BR>
<P>This last time, I went back and used fdisk and nuked
<BR>
all the partitions (even though the prior install,
<BR>
where I opted for Auto Partitioning, had put them
<BR>
there it appeared), and I made sure to start the
<BR>
partitions on cylinder 2 for both drives. 
<BR>
<P>The whole business about getting the filenames at the
<BR>
end of the install was a nightmare. I pressed ATL-F2
<BR>
and CTRL-ALT-F2 and it got me to bash# where I did the
<BR>
cat command and wrote down what was there. However,
<BR>
they did not tell you in the manual how to get back to
<BR>
the other screen, they just say, get back. Needless to
<BR>
say, the same keys didn't work. I tried to type EXIT
<BR>
at the bash prompt and that just said LOGOUT and it
<BR>
hung. Finally, the manual also fails to tell you how
<BR>
to compose a boot command based on the file names you
<BR>
just wrote down in the prior step. Here is what I
<BR>
wrote down:
<BR>
<P>0:1/vmlinuz-2.2.14-6.0 root=/dev/sdb1
<BR>
<P>I had such high hopes for getting this going. Seems
<BR>
like the installation is well-done, except for the
<BR>
fact that I couldn't get it done in a whole day!!
<BR>
<P>Please advise,
<BR>
<P>Rob
