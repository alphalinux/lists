<EM>&gt; Not only have I seen slower performance on my UDB with 5.2 compared to 6.1,
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Slower performance&quot; running what?  KDE or Gnome with E?  You want
<BR>
pretty pictures - you eat memory and this will slow you down.  With a
<BR>
heavy virtual memory use - quite considerably.  UDB was not meant for
<BR>
that.  BTW - using different window manager, like ICEwm or sawmill
<BR>
(renamed recently to sawfish), will cut down on needed resources
<BR>
substantially.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; but I also cannot figure out a comparitive install is so bloated now.
</EM><BR>
<P>Once again.  It very much depends what you install.  If you do &quot;Custom
<BR>
install&quot; and you will pick up _no packages_ from a list then some
<BR>
minimal system will be installed and last time I looked it was quite
<BR>
small. :-)  You may add to that what you __really__ need, and not what
<BR>
can be maybe handy one day, and this still will be not that big.
<BR>
Default installations assume that disks are much bigger nowadays so they
<BR>
dump there various goodies of varying utility.  BTW - did you look what
<BR>
is a size of /usr/doc and /usr/share on a &quot;normal&quot; installation?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have given up on the &quot;Linux can be thin&quot; tenet
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, it can. :-)  I have now Alpha ramdisk with bash, shared libraries
<BR>
from RH 6.1 distro, and quite a few utilities (cut down versions but a
<BR>
&quot;regular&quot; vi, for example) to make it a usable system.  It is still
<BR>
below 2.5 MB.  If I will add more networking support then maybe will
<BR>
start bumping into a whopping 3 MB and maybe even not that.  No, it does
<BR>
not run X-windows. :-)
<BR>
<P>Withing 10 MB of a disk space you should be able to put quite
<BR>
capable system.  Folks at <A HREF="http://www.smartdata.ch/">http://www.smartdata.ch/</A> have a Linux
<BR>
on a credit card (go and see for yourself) but this is not Alpha. :-)
