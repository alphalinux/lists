<P>
I'll concur with him on this w/ Linux too.
<BR>
I bought a brand new DigitalServer 3300 w/ a DE500 based card only to have similar problems. The card wouldn't jump to full duplex without having to force the hub to it. If you didn't force the hub to FDX, the card was extremely flakey at 100Mbps. 1/2DX. Forcing it to FDX improved it a bit, but was still a little flakey. 
<BR>
Thinking it might be a problem w/ the kernel on that server, I swapped the Netgear card from my SX into the 3300 and  the DE500 into the SX. Just as I suspected, the card performed the same as it had in the 3300, flakey under high xfer load at FDX and still needs to be forced to FDX to even have 1/2 a shot at working right. next time I get home I'm grabbing my spare Netgear card and throwing it in the SX and putting the DE500 in an anti-static bag for a rainy day (either to toss it in the rain or try and fiddle with it.. depends on the mood) =)

<P><P><EM>&gt; Just a suggestion, but after all this talking back and forth about will 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or will not tulips work on certain hardware or not, I think I would just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; break down and purchase a DEC DE500 card. They're sure not as cheap as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Netgear cards, but I'd suggest that they'll work on any OS (Linux,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Tru64, OpenVMS, or NT) that you may ever decide to run on your Alpha

<EM>&gt; hardware.

<P>True, but a little bit ago, we tested DE500 on UNIX and could not get full
<BR>
100Mbit performance out of it.
<BR>
<P>You might wanna give a try to ITI6110 series, good LVD SCSI and 10/100 combo
<BR>
which seem to have full performance out of
