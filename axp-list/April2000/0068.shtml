<P><P>KANSAS CITY (APRIL 3, 2000) - Atipa Linux Solutions, a leading developer of
<BR>
Linux solutions, announced today its acquisition of DCG Computer Corp., a
<BR>
premier provider of high-performance, value-added Alpha and Intel computing
<BR>
solutions on multiple platforms.
<BR>
<P>The acquisition strengthens Atipa's end-to-end Linux solutions with new
<BR>
product development resources, clustering and Alpha technologies and a loyal
<BR>
DCG customer base. It also gains DCG's seasoned management team, Red
<BR>
Hat-certified technical staff and expertise in integrating Linux into other
<BR>
operating system environments.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Our goal is to provide end-to-end Linux solutions - and not just in
<BR>
Linux-only enterprises,&quot; said Jason Talley, Chairman and CEO of Atipa. &quot;DCG
<BR>
also represents a good strategic fit as it builds on Atipa's blue-chip
<BR>
customer base with several Fortune 100 companies and numerous large
<BR>
educational and research organizations.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The DCG acquisition is the latest in Atipa's strategic initiatives to
<BR>
broaden its capabilities as a full-service Linux solutions provider. Earlier
<BR>
in the year, Atipa announced that it would acquire Enhanced Software
<BR>
Technologies, a provider of award-winning Linux-based backup and recovery
<BR>
software, BRU. These activities follow Atipa?s second round of funding in
<BR>
February when Atipa received $30 million from an investment group led by
<BR>
investment affiliates of Soros Private Equity Partners LLC, TA Associates,
<BR>
and WR Hambrecht + Co.
<BR>
<P>&quot;As part of the Atipa team, we will be able to leverage synergies to expand
<BR>
our customer base and the range of Linux solutions Atipa can offer,&quot; said
<BR>
Stephen J. Gaudet, DCG's Chief Executive Officer. &quot;We share the same beliefs
<BR>
that Atipa does: that Linux-based solutions offer customers robust and
<BR>
scaleable solutions.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Linux clustering technology is well-suited to meet the needs of large
<BR>
government, educational, and research organizations,&quot; said Talley. &quot;DCG's
<BR>
experience in working with multiple operating systems - and Linux - will be
<BR>
a differentiator for us.&quot;
<BR>
<P>DCG's professional staff will be fully integrated into Atipa's research and
<BR>
development, sales, and marketing operations. DCG's personnel will continue
<BR>
working out of Manchester, N.H.
<BR>
<P>DCG's addition to the Atipa product line includes custom Alpha or Intel
<BR>
workstations in Linux Beowulf configurations. Its Alpha Beowulf solutions
<BR>
are pre-configured, fully integrated and factory-tested. They ship
<BR>
&quot;ready-to-go&quot; with the customers  choices of processor speed, memory, disk
<BR>
storage and peripherals. DCG builds custom systems that meet customer
<BR>
specifications. DCG was the first Digital Alpha partner to support Linux
<BR>
running on Alpha.
<BR>
<P>With the DCG acquisition, Atipa will enhance its product line with solutions
<BR>
that can easily handle programs for animation, CAD/CAM, desktop publishing,
<BR>
multimedia, server, web server, scientific applications and financial
<BR>
analysis.
