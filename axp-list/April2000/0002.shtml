<EM>&gt; &gt; I'd like to switch to a 2.3.xx kernel on my UP2K
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and am wondering if anyone is running one, hopefully
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it's reasonably stable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This message comes to you from 2.3.99-pre1 on my LX and it seems happy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>That's good. I was thinking about the pre 2.4 series
<BR>
as the one to use.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I've installed a Promise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; UATA66 PCI card in it and am looking at installing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; several large UATA66 drives. I've got 3 40GB Maxtors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and a 26GB Quantum for tests. One thing I noticed is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the Promise card doesn't work on hose 1. On hose 0,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it's recognized and the disks are seen.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have a Promise 66 card and found it unstable when I first tried it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around 2.3.2x and haven't tried it since.  I also found I was getting a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; higher bandwidth off my 34GB IBM using the CMD646 on the LX board than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Promise.  Surely that is a driver bug???
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; An hdparm -tT on the CMD646 has just given me 12.82MB/sec - I was getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about 9MB/s out of the Promise.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Even at 9MB/sec, that's sufficient for what I want.
<BR>
The files will be passed across fast Enet so anything
<BR>
close to or faster than 100Bt is fine for what I want.
<BR>
<P>Flakiness worries me. I've noticed that 2.2.14 with
<BR>
IDE-DMA patches does not handle large IDE disk on the
<BR>
Promise card correctly. It bails out between 8-9GB on
<BR>
my tests with FS corruption. My understanding was the
<BR>
2.3.xx series had better large IDE disk support. Given
<BR>
an Alpha has more interupts than an x86, I'd like to
<BR>
put 6-8 large IDE disks on a system for data storage
<BR>
using add-on ATA66 cards.
<BR>
<P>With IBM's new 75GB GXP drive, that's up to 600GB. I
<BR>
see pricing on those at around $600 at the moment. I
<BR>
figure $5000 for 600GB is a good deal so I really want
<BR>
this to work. The IBM's are 1 inch high drives so they
<BR>
are quite dense in terms of how much you can get into
<BR>
a case. 
<BR>
<P>I'll download/try out the 2.3.99pre series to test with.
<BR>
<P>Thanks.
