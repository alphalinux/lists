<EM>&gt; &gt; I doubt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; de4x5.c can handle the new fa310tx cards.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Most likely you are right in these doubts (but Netgear had so many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; variations that it is hard to be sure of anything with these cards :-).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I have at least 3 version of fa310tx's, but not all in
<BR>
Alphas so yes there are a few out there.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; As I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; time, I'll try my normal kernel level (2.2.14) and see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; if it behaves better than RH's version of 2.2.13.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Essential fixes, including a fix to a long standing bug in skbuf
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; handling (this locks up NIC under a heavy traffic and affects likely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all drivers from Donald Becker), were done in 2.2.15pre series.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The current 2.2.15pre19 is for all purposes the same as 2.2.15
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but it is still waiting for &quot;non possum&quot; from Linus so it is &quot;pre&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A &quot;2.2.14&quot; kernel from Red Hat 6.2 distribution is really roughly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.2.15pre11 (IIRC) plus updates to RAID support plus some other patches
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which were included, or subsumed, by later kernels from 2.2.15pre
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; series.  This kernel may also include an updated tulip driver but I did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not check precisely which version is really that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>2.2.15pre is still a moving target but I'm using pre17 I believe
<BR>
on my UP2K's. It runs promise UATA66 cards well. It's taking damn
<BR>
long to get 2.2.15 stable/released.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You will find in the latest kernels 'de4x5', 'old_tulip' and 'tulip'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drivers.  There are various tulip cards which will work with all three
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of those (I have such card, for example) or with only two or maybe with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only one.  This depends on differences in transmitters (an maybe also in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an autonegotiation sequence); various manufacturers did assorted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;improvements&quot; to a design one time or another.  'old_tulip' driver is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supposed to be redundant in the current 2.2.15pre, and is included only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as a safety measure, but it may turn out that this precaution is vital
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to somebody with some particular model of card.  Time will tell. :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>It was interesting that de4x5 actually ran this card. It didn't
<BR>
two years ago when I bought the system. I went back and tried
<BR>
the &quot;old_tulip&quot; module and it too correctly runs the card.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I know that this may be confusing but &quot;Tulip&quot; is really a sizeable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; family of cards with varying characteristics with quite a bit of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this stuff not really ever published as technical specs.  If you think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that with other NICs the situation is better you may be for a surprise. :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd guess tulip is at least several dozen cards. I've
<BR>
personally used at least 10 with it.
<BR>
<P>The key question was whether a PC164 could run any PCI Enet card.
<BR>
It certainly does run the one I have with two of three drivers
<BR>
using RH's 6.1 kernel.
<BR>
<P>Sometime in the near future I need to download RH6.2.
