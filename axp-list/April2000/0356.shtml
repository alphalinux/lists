<P>I'd say that depends on how many one plans on buying. If
<BR>
the number is 200, one might make a different decision than
<BR>
if it were one.
<BR>
<P>Also, only one OS is of interest in that list to me.

<P>In general, as in previous posts, I buy the cheapo's and
<BR>
they've pretty much always worked. I find it amusing in
<BR>
general to try different cards to see what works/doesn't.
<BR>
At $15-$30 a card, it's not an expensive hobby so why
<BR>
not as long as I have time. (not much of that lately)
