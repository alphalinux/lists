<P><P>Harry:
<BR>
<P>- The DS10/DS10L uses an ALI 1543C SouthBridge/SuperIO chip, with a
<BR>
Dallas
<BR>
Semiconductor 12887 RTC/CMOS RAM/Integrated battery hanging off the
<BR>
1543C's
<BR>
XBUS.
<BR>
<P>- The XP1000 uses a Cypress Semiconductor 693U SouthBridge which has
<BR>
integrated RTC/CMOS RAM with an external coin cell battery.
<BR>
<P>- In both cases, the RTCs provide a 32KHZ square wave which is the time
<BR>
base
<BR>
for the software TOY clock.
<BR>
<P>- Both the ALI 1543C and the Cypress 693U have integrated a Timer Unit
<BR>
that
<BR>
is compatible with 8254 register addressing and description.

<P>Does anyone know much about the motherboards of various Compaq Alpha
<BR>
machines?  Specifically DS10 compared with XP1000.  We're planning on
<BR>
using RTLinux on Alpha for an upcoming project, ideally on Compaq
<BR>
XP1000's.
<BR>
<P>We know that RedHat 6.1 (and 6.2?) runs on these machines, but RTLinux
<BR>
relies on the RTC.  The Alpha port of RTLinux (see www.rtlinux.com) is
<BR>
being developed on a DS10, which has this configuration, but no-one
<BR>
seems to know if the XP1000 does also.
<BR>
<P>I've tried asking various people within Compaq, but can't get any
<BR>
firm answers, and the RTLinux developers can only speak for the DS10.
<BR>
<P>According to one of the RTLinux developers, the thing we need to
<BR>
find out is;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Key thing to check is wheether the xP1000 follows the standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Compaq design: an 8253 that is generally not used and a RTC hooked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the timer pin.  This design is convenient for the port since we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have seen the 8253 before and since Linux does not use the 8253s at all.
</EM><BR>
<P>Any help would be appreciated.
