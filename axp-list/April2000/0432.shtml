<P>
We've had Compaq fix at least 50 systems. This is the scoop we got back in
<BR>
January:
<BR>
<P>---------
<BR>
There have been two bugs found in the XP1000's:
<BR>
<P>1.    A problem has been identified with early CPU Boards which can cause a
<BR>
variety of failures on the board.  The part number in question is 5425088-01
<BR>
(it's the -01 that's important).  The problem has been tracked to the
<BR>
Motorola SRAM's used on the assembly.  The fix is a no cost replacement of
<BR>
the entire assembly (on failure of the original).  Compaq has issued a &quot;FCO&quot;
<BR>
(&quot;Field Change Order&quot; I think) for this part. Compaq fieldpersonnel
<BR>
reportedly know about this FCO.  Care must be taken to ensure that the part
<BR>
number of the replacement assembly is 5425088-03 (it's the-03 that's
<BR>
important)!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three of the failed systems we have seen can be attributed to this
<BR>
problem.
<BR>
<P>2.     A problem with the Power Supply has just been identified!!!  The
<BR>
power supply vendor (in China) has identified an issue which can lead to
<BR>
premature failure of the supply.  US Immigration requires that all &quot;natural
<BR>
products&quot; used as shipping containers be fumigated against insects &amp; disease
<BR>
prior to leaving port.  It appears that instead of spraying the empty
<BR>
containers, they sprayed containers already stacked with power supplies.
<BR>
<P>It appears that some of the agents used in the spray (chlorine and bromine)
<BR>
have caused several of the components in the supply to breakdown and fail.
<BR>
This problem has affected some 1200 supplies!!!
<BR>
<P>A potentially faulty supply can be identified by its serial number
<BR>
(formatted as 2P9xxyyyyyy) The supplies affected by this include all
<BR>
supplies starting with 2P913 (13th week of the 9th month).
<BR>
--------
<BR>
<P>Plus an update in Feb:
<BR>
<P>-----------
<BR>
the latest out of Compaq is that not all CPU modules are bad!
<BR>
<P>Now they're saying it's CPU module 54-25088-01 with date codes 911
<BR>
through 918.

<EM>&gt; I can confirm that I don't know the Real Scoop on XP1000 power supplies,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; despite owning a large number of them. And it's not for lack of asking.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We haven't seen any double failures, and our overall % of failures is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; significantly lower than yours.
