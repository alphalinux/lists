My binary just got too big on Redhat 4.2.  When I link I start seeing
<BR>
gobs &amp; gobs &quot;relocation truncated to fit&quot;  errors, as in:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/lib/crtend.o: In function `__do_global_ctors_aux':
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;../sysdeps/alpha/elf/crtend.S:73: relocation truncated to fit: LITERAL __CTOR_END__
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;../sysdeps/alpha/elf/crtend.S:73: relocation truncated to fit: LITERAL __do_global_ctors_aux
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/lib/libpvm3.a(lpvm.o): In function `pvmbeatask':
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/src/redhat/BUILD/pvm3/src/LINUXALPHA/../../src/lpvm.c:2956: relocation truncated to fit: LITERAL $C123
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/src/redhat/BUILD/pvm3/src/LINUXALPHA/../../src/lpvm.c:2965: relocation truncated to fit: LITERAL $C124
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/src/redhat/BUILD/pvm3/src/LINUXALPHA/../../src/lpvm.c:2970: relocation truncated to fit: LITERAL $C125
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/src/redhat/BUILD/pvm3/src/LINUXALPHA/../../src/lpvm.c:2980: relocation truncated to fit: LITERAL $C126

<P>I realize this has to do with one of the ELF sections getting too big, 
<BR>
and it can be worked around by either upgrading to RH 5 or later, or
<BR>
making some of the libraries shared.  For various reasons, I don't
<BR>
want to get into that right now.  For one thing they'd both be fairly
<BR>
significant changes to our system &amp; would require lots of testing time
<BR>
to prove out, and I really need to move these new binaries now.  So,
<BR>
I'd much prefer to just cut out some of the application code I'm
<BR>
familiar with in an effort to get under the limits.
<BR>
<P>So, what exactly is in this ELF section that's overflowing?  Do I need
<BR>
to get rid of global symbols, or will making global structures &amp;
<BR>
functions smaller also help?   Is there anything else in this section
<BR>
that I can decrease by tweaking the code?  How can I see exactly
<BR>
what it's trying to put in this section so as to see how much I have
<BR>
to get rid of?
<BR>
<P>If this doesn't help, is there a sort of minimal upgrade path I can
<BR>
use on RH4.2 to get it to the point where it'll split up this section?
<BR>
<P>Finally, when I use nm on some of my libraries, I see some weird
<BR>
stuff:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[randy pascal-1.27]$ nm ApiUser/libapiuser_opt.a | head -20
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bf_callback.o:
<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0000000000000058 r $C44
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0000000000000000 a *ABS*
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0000000000000000 t __gnu_compiled_c
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0000000000000300 d bf_current_seq_num
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0000000000000000 T bf_default_parameters
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0000000000000008 t bf_default_parameters..ng
<BR>
<P>I don't see these weird $Cxx symbols when I build under RH5.2 (yes,
<BR>
I've got a bunch of RH4.2s I can't upgrade &amp; a bunch of RH5.2s which
<BR>
are ok with the code).  What are these?  These aren't the only weird
<BR>
extra symbols I see on RH4.2 vs RH5.2.  Would getting rid of these
<BR>
things help?  Also, what are these weird ..ng symbols that are showing
<BR>
up?  They're not on RH5.2 either.
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
