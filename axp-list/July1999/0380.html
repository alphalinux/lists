<P>
<EM>&gt;From my experience, the DP264 (aka Compaq DS20) is quite stable under
</EM><BR>
Linux. There are a few things to watch out for though:
<BR>
<P>1) Kernel version. 2.2.7 seems to be farily reliable, after that things
<BR>
can get a little strange. The only catch is that 2.2.7 will need to be
<BR>
compiled as Generic kernel (not DP264).
<BR>
<P>2) Check your SRM version, there can be a few strange things with older
<BR>
versions.
<BR>
<P>3) RH 5.2 has a really early kernel for these machines that's very
<BR>
unreliable, make sure to get Jay's updated kernel from gatekeeper.
<BR>
<P>4) The RH6.0 kernel seems to be fairly good, except that it seems to have
<BR>
problems with NCR53c8xx cards if I remember correctly.
<BR>
<P>I would imagine that most of these points also carry over to just about
<BR>
any 21264 machine out there, mainly because at the moment they are based
<BR>
around Tsunami.
<BR>
<P>Most of the testing I've done has been with either Matrox Millenium or
<BR>
Elsa Gloria Synergy (Permedia II) graphics cards, and either DEC Tulip or
<BR>
3Com NICs, 256-1Gig of memory and up to several SCSI disks.
<BR>
<P>That's all I can think of at the moment....

<P><EM>&gt; Hello!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am currently planning to present Linux/Alpha on the german computer fair
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Systems in Munich 18.-22.10.1999. For this showcase I intend to ask Compaq
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Germany if they could lend me the most powerful supprted machine they have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in order to present a good picture of Linux and of course a fast machine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They will for sure ask me what kind of machine I intend to have and so here
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is my question ;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I currently only have experience with 21064 and 21164 machines but 21264 is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; completely new to me. What I would have to know is what machine type will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; run Linux as stable as possible. I tried to figure out on the net but could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not find something useful. All FAQs and WWW pages are somewhat outdated for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this topic ;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would be happy if someone could recommend a good system to me (machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; type or board type, graphics card and so on).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thank you in advance!
