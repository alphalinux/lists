<P>
You must be joking but I'll play along.  VMS is available on VAX and Alpha;
<BR>
seeing VMS on Intel would be ludicrous to both.  For one thing the former is
<BR>
somewhere between maintaining-its-ground' and slowly-fading-away.  It's a
<BR>
solid OS but it's not generating any new excitement.  I know firsthand that
<BR>
new technologies like Java were never considered when VMS was in its prime.
<BR>
The two don't play ball together.  VMS/Alpha runs Java but has to kludge
<BR>
everything to do it.  VMS/VAX was dropped Java a while back because IEEE
<BR>
floating point could not be emulated satisfactorily.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, would you *really* want VMS on Intel?  I find three things curious:
<BR>
you picked 1) Alpha based discussion talking about 2) Linux and the topic is
<BR>
3) &quot;RH 6.0 can't see Multia ethernet.&quot;  Did you take a wrong turn at
<BR>
Albequerque?  C-:&lt;
