<EM>&gt; System: Ruffian UX4, Diamond FireGL1000Pro, off the shelf RH6.0

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks to those who suggested skipping the symlink and going straight to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; _explicit_ kernel file name (either of /boot/vmlinu[zx]-2.2.5-16) on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; milo boot line.
</EM><BR>
<P>You will save yourself some typing if you create /etc/milo.conf.
<BR>
A sample such file is on a boot disk from RH6.0 distribution (a file
<BR>
system on it is _not_ compressed so you can mount it and have a look).
<BR>
Then at 'MILO&gt;' prompt you may type 'b sda2', or whatever is a partition
<BR>
name on which /etc/milo.conf resides and after that type a label you
<BR>
gave to some particular configuration.
<BR>
<P>I do not think that you can auto-boot that way.  If this is not the
<BR>
case then somebody, please, correct me.  This is, obviously, not
<BR>
a very big deal as you can autoboot in another way.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Both files work OK, I didn't bother trying the symlink
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; again to see if my failure had mysteriously disappeared.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why RH bothered to stick both on a hard drive is a bit of a mystery.
<BR>
This is actually the same thing - one in a compressed state and the
<BR>
other uncompressed.  Updates actually have 2.2.5-22 (and also both
<BR>
files are present - RH has some deals with disk makers or what? *).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Do I need a patched version
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    of ping? (*)
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2) Gnome gives me 2 core files every time I log on
</EM><BR>
<P>Hm, works for me (but not some other things).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    do this), and I don't like the ammount of memory it eats, so I'd rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    go back to plain simple fvwm2. To do this, I have a .xsession file
</EM><BR>
<P>Do that rather in your own .Xclients.  In /etc/X11/xinint/ there is a
<BR>
system file Xclients.  Looking at its contents it is clear that if you
<BR>
have a file /etc/sysconfig/desktop with a line which says &quot;AnotherLevel&quot;
<BR>
then fvwm2 will start instead of Gnome - provided, of course, that fvwm2
<BR>
was installed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    containing xterm&amp;; xearth&amp;; fvwm2 and no more. On the PC, this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    fine and I get. On the PC everything's OK, on the Alpha I get an xearth,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    but no other windows, and no menus on my mouse.
</EM><BR>
<P>It sounds like you did not install fvwm2.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4) Sometimes I try `telinit -t 1 3` to go from 5 to 3. This disappears up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    its own arse. I can sometimes go to 1, and then to 3. Erm?
</EM><BR>
<P>There is a big pile of updates to 6.0.  It is possible that I do not
<BR>
see some of the stuff you are talking about because I have updates
<BR>
applied.  In particular I was switching levels with telinit and so far
<BR>
nothing strange happened.  Maybe just lucky?
<BR>

<BR>
<P>*) The current glibc is some 58 Megabytes!  Bulk of this stuff are not
<BR>
libraries at all but /usr/lib/gconv/ and /usr/share/i18n/.  You may need
<BR>
sometimes some pieces but highly likely you will not ever look at 98%
<BR>
of that.  This is crazy as this covers only a small handful of languages
<BR>
and people with other language needs can rightfuly ask &quot;why not me?&quot;.
<BR>
It has to be some way to install only what you need or executables will
<BR>
soon be an insignificant minority on your hard drive filled with stuff
<BR>
_you_ never touch (somebody else might but s/he will be care about things
<BR>
important for you).  As things stand right now you have, for example,
<BR>
a bunch of random manpages in a Brazillian version of Portuguese.
<BR>
Who knows why these and not others.  Anybody for a full set of a
<BR>
documentation and glibc messages in Cree?  Why not?  More people likely
<BR>
use that than Gaelic.
