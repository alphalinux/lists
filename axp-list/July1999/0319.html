Greetings,
<BR>
<P>I would have let this alone if only one person had brought it up but since 2
<BR>
people have, very politely, suggested that I should be discreet about my
<BR>
comments pertaining to VMS I feel I should set the record straight.
<BR>
<P>VMS doesn't need anyone to apologize for it.  There are some 1/4 of a
<BR>
trillion people who love it still and they know what a solid workhorse it's
<BR>
always been.  In retrospect VMS may have been one of the most important
<BR>
things that *ever* came out of Digital.  I've never been a VMS fan (can ya
<BR>
tell?) but my opinions about this are inappropriate, especially on a
<BR>
Linux/Alpha site!
<BR>
<P>I'll admit a lack of foresight in underestimating the potential in having
<BR>
VMS ported to every platform under the sun.  It would great to see one or
<BR>
more of Digital/Compaq's OSes running on every platform *including* the Sun!
<BR>
I really need to learn business savvy!!!! ;-&gt;
