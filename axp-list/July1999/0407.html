<P>
An upgrade to V5.4 helped some... We've been off of maintenance for
<BR>
a while, but I found all the helpful things on gatekeeper...thanks for the
<BR>
info...
<BR>
<P>First of all, bootflags has to be set in boot_osflags- neither '' nor &quot;&quot;
<BR>
are apparently sufficient to cause all of the arguments to be put into the
<BR>
flags field.
<BR>
<P>Then booting generic did:
<BR>
(boot dka500.5.0.1.1 -file kernels/generic.gz -flags root=/dev/scd0 load_ramdisk=1)
<BR>
block 0 of dka500.5.0.1.1 is a valid boot block
<BR>
reading 168 blocks from dka500.5.0.1.1
<BR>
bootstrap code read in
<BR>
Building FRU table
<BR>
base = 200000, image_start = 0, image_bytes = 15000
<BR>
initializing HWRPB at 2000
<BR>
initializing page table at 1f2000
<BR>
initializing machine state
<BR>
setting affinity to the primary CPU
<BR>
jumping to bootstrap code
<BR>
aboot: Linux/Alpha SRM bootloader version 0.5
<BR>
aboot: switching to OSF/1 PALcode version 1.23
<BR>
aboot: no disklabel found.
<BR>
aboot: booted_dev=`scsi 1 1 0 5 500 6000 11000', guessing
<BR>
boot_device=`scd0'
<BR>
iso: Max size:283603   Log zone size:2048
<BR>
iso: First datazone:27   Root inode number 55296
<BR>
aboot: loading compressed kernels/generic.gz...
<BR>
aboot: ok, now starting the kernel...
<BR>
(hangs)
<BR>
<P><P>Appending a 'console=serial' to the options did not help. Booting from the
<BR>
floppy images did not help (no surprise there). This is a machine has been
<BR>
known to run linux (2.2.4- and unfortunately somebody wiped the disk it
<BR>
was on- otherwise I would just do a variety of other steps rather than
<BR>
bother with the list here). It currently runs NetBSD just fine.
<BR>
<P>I think this is where I left this with rth- when/if I get a clear enough
<BR>
shot at the machine (it's a shared resource at the NAS unit at NASA/Ames 
<BR>
Research Center), I'll find out why it's not working for Linux.
<BR>
<P>I still stand by my previous statement that &quot;All alpha installs for me and
<BR>
nearly all sparc installs over the last 3 years have not gone well&quot;. I'm
<BR>
not a stupid person but this RH-Linux &quot;It works for me&quot; stuff is making me
<BR>
feel stupid and somewhat angry (responses like, &quot;Take over the world? not
<BR>
bloody likely, me buckos...&quot; start flooding the mind)....
<BR>
<P>But anyway, thanks for the attempt to help. I suggest that RedHat might
<BR>
want to do a slightly better job of saying what is actually known to work.
<BR>
I've spent the money to buy the CD's for the last 3 years or so because
<BR>
that's the right thing to do, but I don't intend to continue as it's not a
<BR>
good 'out of box' experience. Nor is it possible to sell NAS' management
<BR>
on allowing some Linux development for these machines when the CDs that
<BR>
claim to support Alpha 4100s clearly don't support the ones we have- they
<BR>
point to a perfectly functioning NetBSD system (which I did the port for)
<BR>
and say, &quot;No need- see?&quot;. Tsk.
