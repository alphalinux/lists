<P>
<EM>&gt; Again...agreed.  But what I personally don't like are responses (kind of like the one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that I gave) that are &quot;I dunno - I have system X and it worked for me&quot;.  I'd much prefer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the respondent give the very useful info of things such as peripheral cards, memory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; config (the whole &quot;bad things happen with &gt; 2GB&quot; thing a while back...), number of CPUs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (obviously where applicable), and what boot method (again, where applicable).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree that finding that someone did get a rawhide to install (me) is useful.  Not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mentioning that I didn't do it over serial console was more misleading - it can lead to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a big rathole if you're not careful.  I think these things are something along the lines
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of posting an oops report that hasn't been decoded - it tells us there's something wrong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; somewhere, but we usually have a really hard time figuring out where.  Now...so as to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; follow my own advice, here is how far booting my rawhide got (configuration is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-evident, as I'm posting the entirety of the boot messages):
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks. Yes, this is helpful. I certainly had believed that it must have
<BR>
worked for someone at some point! Like I said, I had a working 2.2.4
<BR>
kernel RH5.2 system (installed on a multia, hauled in and working on this
<BR>
very machine) which got scrogged.. so I know that this particular machine
<BR>
had actually run linux out the serial console once...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  sdg: sdg1 sdg2 sdg3 sdg4
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; VFS: Mounted root (iso9660 filesystem) readonly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Freeing unused kernel memory: 168k freed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It then hangs - no keyboard input is possible.  I believe the next step
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is to add swap  (normally).  Hmmm... verrry interesting.  Anyone care to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; venture a guess as to why this didn't work?
</EM><BR>
<P>At the moment, ENOCLUE....sigh, I wish I was at NASA/Ames today- I could
<BR>
pursue this right now...
