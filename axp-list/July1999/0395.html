<P><EM>&gt;   Okay. So, I'm a physicist. I use TeX. I need postscript. Why is it that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; under 6.0 I get garbage printing postscript? So I have an old cannon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bubble jet printer, and it's worked since redhat 2.0 on my intel box. Now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I get pages of &quot;unrecoverable error: rangecheck in setcolorscreen&quot; blah
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blah blah. It prints text fine. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I had a problem with my Canon bubble jet (bj10e) where it would simply
<BR>
print black all the time.  I shifted back to the ghostscript from RH5.2
<BR>
and all was fine again.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Redhat guys, this has gone too far. Count me out. I'm going with either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; debian or suse, when it's released. I'm also going to urge the same to my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; colleagues. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds a bit extreme.  I don't know why the ghostscript problem hasn't
<BR>
been fixed yet but as usual there is a work around.  I expect RH6.1 will
<BR>
be lots better, RH5.0 was a nightmare too remember.
