<P>
Just out of curosity, have you done an emergency reload of the NVRAM?
<BR>
I was having some problems with my Multia that the reload fixed.  (And
<BR>
yes, it was my own stupidity that caused the problems too.)
<BR>
<P>If you need to compare anything to my Multia, let me know.  I live in the
<BR>
Denver area too.
