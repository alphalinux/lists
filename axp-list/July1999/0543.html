<P>
About two weeks ago I tried to install DEC UNIX 4.0D on my 164LX which
<BR>
has a ncr53c895 which I thought was supported but turned out it wasn't.
<BR>
During this time I was swapping in hard drives and trying to load DU not
<BR>
realizing my SCSI card wasn't supported. Now that I've switched back to
<BR>
AlphaBIOS and milo some strange things are happening to my scsi card.
<BR>
<P>This is my problem. My card has a total of 4 jacks on it. the External
<BR>
68 pin U2W bus, the Internel U2W bus which is part of the external bus,
<BR>
an internal 68 pin UW bus, and a internal 50 pin SCSI-2 bus. The drive
<BR>
in question that is cauing me this headache is a fujitsu 4.3 gig UW HD
<BR>
which I've owned for about 2 years now. The controller card is a
<BR>
DigtialScape DataStorm 32 Plus.
<BR>
<P>My SCSI subsystem consists of the following devices:
<BR>
9.3GB Quantum Atlas III U2W LVD HD
<BR>
4.3GB Fujitsu UW HD
<BR>
32X  Toshiba CD-ROM
<BR>
4X/12X Plextror CD-R
<BR>
<P>The Quantum is on it's on chain with an active terminator.
<BR>
The Fujitsu is on it's own chain with termination set on the drive
<BR>
The Toshiba and Plextor both site on the same SCSI-2 chain with
<BR>
termination set on the Plextor. 
<BR>
<P>This configuration worked flawlesses untill I started to fool around
<BR>
with DEC UNIX and changing my firmware to SRM. Now having flashed my
<BR>
bios back to AlphaBIOS with the exact same configuration I recieve this
<BR>
error just after the kernel logger starts I hit an endless loop.
<BR>
<P>ncr53c895-0: command processing resumed
<BR>
scsi0 channel 0 : resetting for second half of retries.
<BR>
SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0
<BR>
<P>ncr53c8xx_reset: pid= 3649 reset_flags=1 serial_number=0
<BR>
serial_number_at_timeout=0
<BR>
<P>ncr53c895-0: resetting, command processing for two seconds
<BR>
scsi0: device driver called scsi_done for a syncronous reset.
<BR>
ncr53c895-0: enabling clock multplier
<BR>
ncr53c895-0: Dwonloading SCSI SCRIPTS.
<BR>
<P>Now if I turn the machine off and connect my Fujitsu to the U2W chain
<BR>
along with the Quantum it works fine but now both drives run at 40
<BR>
MB/sec
<BR>
so I lose out on half the bandwidth the Quantum can offer. Now check
<BR>
this out. I can take both drives and put it on the UW chain and it boots
<BR>
fine but again it's 40MB/sec. Now I'm totaly confused. I'm running stock
<BR>
RH 6.0 kernel. I've already fdisked and LLF the Fujustu to no avail.
<BR>
I've come up with two possibilites neither of which are very good for
<BR>
me. Either the UW chain was somehow damaged by all the drive swapping I
<BR>
did (which I seriously doubt) or switching back and forth between SRM
<BR>
and AlphaBIOS somehow corrupted part of the card's firmware.
<BR>
<P>Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks.
<BR>
<P>Peter
