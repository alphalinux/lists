<EM>&gt; Have you tried a serial cable?  My UDB won't output anything to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; monitor, but works happily from the serial console.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had thought to try that, but after I saw SROM codes telling me
<BR>
to return the board for service I decided not to mess with it. But after
<BR>
reading your suggestion, I thought it would be best to try anyway... And
<BR>
guess what? IT IS ALIVE!!! It came right up, went through SRM and booted
<BR>
the ARC loader. Though, in my earlier efforts to bring it back to life
<BR>
(i.e. replacing CMOS battery), the NVRAM has been erased. Not a big
<BR>
problem, except I can't seem to get the cursor keys on my terminal to work
<BR>
in the ARC loader's menus. :( I am using another Linux box as terminal,
<BR>
where minicom locks up when the ARC loader menu is reached, and with
<BR>
seyon, the screen just redraws with every cursor key press. What do I need
<BR>
to do / What terminal program do I need to use to get the ARC loader to
<BR>
respond intelligently to cursor keys? The physical connection between the
<BR>
alpha and the &quot;terminal&quot; is just a straight through terminal cable with a
<BR>
null modem adapter that has worked fine for other serial consoles (Linux
<BR>
and Sparc).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to everyone who offered me help in finding a new Alpha! But
<BR>
after a look at my money status and this breath of life from my poor, old
<BR>
UDB, I don't think I am in the market for a new machine after all. :)
