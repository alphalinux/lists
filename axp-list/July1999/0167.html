<P>
i have also done this this way and it works better than i could ever
<BR>
emagine.  I also had to make aliases of each network card.  Dont ask my why
<BR>
but i did and it worked in a flash.

<P><P>I'm running a firewall on my ruffian system.  I've got two intel
<BR>
eepro100s.  I just load the eepro100 module and it detecs and configures
<BR>
both (you just have to figure out which one is eth0 and which is eth1, but
<BR>
after that it always loads them in the same order).  I then just used
<BR>
ipchains and it is working fine, aside from not letting a citrix client on
<BR>
the inside connect to the server (I'm doing network address translation
<BR>
and I think that it makes citrix unhappy).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try just making both ethernet drivers a module and then loading
<BR>
them in the same order every time.  Each driver should take the first
<BR>
available eth device, so that the first one that you modprobe is eth0 and
<BR>
the second is eth1.
