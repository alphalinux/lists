<P>
I get the exact same message using the Uniprint drivers on an Epson
<BR>
Stylus Color 600. I downgraded back to the ghostscript from RH5.2
<BR>
and it worked with the stcolor driver.
<BR>
<P>I feel your pain...Red Hat 6.0 has been one headache after another...
<BR>
lpc is broke, PostScript printing is hosed, GnoRPM dumps core when
<BR>
installing RPMs, and xfs font serving is broken. I found this after
<BR>
having it installed in one day. They need to work on testing for
<BR>
Alpha!

<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So, I'm a physicist. I use TeX. I need postscript. Why is it that
<BR>
under 6.0 I get garbage printing postscript? So I have an old cannon
<BR>
bubble jet printer, and it's worked since redhat 2.0 on my intel box. Now
<BR>
I get pages of &quot;unrecoverable error: rangecheck in setcolorscreen&quot; blah
<BR>
blah blah. It prints text fine. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Redhat guys, this has gone too far. Count me out. I'm going with either
<BR>
debian or suse, when it's released. I'm also going to urge the same to my
<BR>
colleagues. 
<BR>
<P>Eric.
