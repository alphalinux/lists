<P>
This fixed ghostview for me (at least color PS files are displayed
<BR>
correctly), and I got Postscript output, but alas, it looks like
<BR>
it prints several lines and then skips some, repeatedly. :-( Maybe
<BR>
this is some other problem I've run into.
<BR>
<P>So it's still only a partial solution. As for your fonts, make
<BR>
sure you upgrade (downgrade?) the ghostscript-fonts package too.

<P><P><EM>&gt;I get the exact same message using the Uniprint drivers on an Epson
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Stylus Color 600. I downgraded back to the ghostscript from RH5.2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and it worked with the stcolor driver.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This almost fixes this problem. I can print postscript now, but I get
<BR>
some font corruption. I wonder if it has something to do with xfig as
<BR>
well.
