<P>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have a few questions about the new layout of RH6.0 and kernel builds...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; First off, what is this /etc/milo.conf file all about
</EM><BR>
<P>It is not new at all.  But I do not think that it ever documented.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; how do I use it?
</EM><BR>
<P>Mount your boot floppy and have a look at the example.  This is just
<BR>
a text file so you can write yourself something similar, experiment
<BR>
a bit, and you will know. :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What packages update or affect it?
</EM><BR>
<P>None.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; edited by hand when a new kernel is installed or built?
</EM><BR>
<P>You may create it with an editor when you feel like it.  It is not
<BR>
required for anything.  It may just save you some typing and you may
<BR>
bypass it anyway.  You may write a bunch of different stanzas with the
<BR>
different labels and different options but the same kernel.  Just a
<BR>
convenience.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I heard that recompiling the kernel is no longer necessary.
</EM><BR>
<P>????
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How can that be?
</EM><BR>
<P>It was always like that.  You booted so it runs and you do not have
<BR>
to recompile.  Usually you want to - to customize to your hardware -
<BR>
but this is your choice.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is the stock kernel configured with *all* drivers? That couldn't be.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Stock&quot; 6.0 alpha installation comes with some 5 Meg plus of modules.
<BR>
Take your pick.  A distribution kernel is pretty fat on its own.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is so, what is the procedure for building new kernels on Alpha? I only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recall the &quot;old&quot; Red Hat method of downloading sources and going through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the make mrproper...yada yada yada. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Nothing changed here. :-)  Although 'make mrproper' was required only
<BR>
in rare circumstances.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is there an easier way to build kernels now?
</EM><BR>
<P>Hm, 'make oldconfig; make clean boot modules' does not strike me as an
<BR>
extremely hard thing to type.
