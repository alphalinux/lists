<P><EM>&gt; At first I thought &quot;Ya got me!&quot;  But after looking at the site I feel a bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vindicated.  They state clearly that Free-VMS is an OpenVMS *look-alike*.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So is it really VMS?  You have to decide.  Fairly similar to the Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; question.  Linux isn't really UNIX but in some ways it out-UNIXes UNIX!
</EM><BR>
<P>If Free-VMS gets as close to 'real' VMS as Linux does to UNIX -- then
<BR>
in practice I'll refer to it as VMS in some scenarios.. same way a lot of
<BR>
people do with Linux/UNIX. When talking to a kernel hacker, or driver
<BR>
programmer -- I'll be painfully accurate, but if I'm talking to a newbie
<BR>
who is just learning bash programming Linux == UNIX. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There's alway some bozo out there willing to port some OS or application to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his own platform.  I personally am not too excited about VMS but even less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so with regards to Intel!
</EM><BR>
<P>Same could be said for Linux at the start. Unix on x86? Why? I remember
<BR>
thinking that way. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There's a difference between doing something for your own satisfaction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and producing something that people really want!
</EM><BR>
<P>Linus didn't start out to save the world -- he started out because he
<BR>
wanted a better 'UNIX' than Minix on his 386. It snowballed (avalanching
<BR>
might be a good term these days, if you are optimistic) and the rest is
<BR>
history.
<BR>
<P>The lesson: great things start from humble beginnings. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Linux &quot;lacks&quot; (don't slaughter me on this word--Linux is just not yet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gaining much interest in the desktop and IMHO *won't* until it can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; coexist as both a hacker's environment and a commercially viable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; product; AFAIK a Netscape browser still is not available for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux/Alpha unless you count Mozilla which if I recall was an early
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; version of Netscape) the basic kinds of apps that are central to WinCE.
</EM><BR>
<P>Myself, I'm not too intersted in Linux as a desktop OS per se.. but
<BR>
I don't understand what you mean about apps. Linux has plenty of small
<BR>
lightweight apps -- UNIX philosophy and all -- and if anything, this is
<BR>
the desktop user's main COMPLAINT. 
<BR>
<P>Which is why I don't really WANT Linux to succeed on the desktop -- that
<BR>
would imply large, integrated (-&gt; bloated) apps that hog resources. 
<BR>
<P>But, all this misses the point in a free VMS and pocket-Linux for me..
<BR>
&lt;puts on R. Stallman mask&gt; .. 
<BR>
<P>It's about free software. I don't care about the open source development
<BR>
model. I don't care about the best way to develop powerful, stable
<BR>
applications -- and I'm not overly concerned with price. 
<BR>
<P>It's about having the freedom to hack on the source and add features that
<BR>
I want, and to quash bugs that affect me. I can't do this with CE or
<BR>
PalmOS .. I can with Linux. 
<BR>
<P>To rob a phrase from the current issue of Linux Journal:
<BR>
<P>It really is about free beer.
<BR>
<P>&lt;puts R. Stallman mask back in the closet&gt;
