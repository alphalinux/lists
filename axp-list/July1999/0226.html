<EM>&gt; &gt; I gave up with 2.2.x on alpha, at least for this millennium.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Do you want to run 2.0.x for another year and a half?  
</EM><BR>
<P>No, just five months and a couple of weeks....
<BR>
Counting starts from 0, doesn't it?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Have you heard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.4 is to be released this year?
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok, then perhaps 2,2 will have reached some stability *on the alpha*.
<BR>
I am not complaining! I think that a lot of people here are doing
<BR>
fabulous things in carrying on the AlphaLinux development,
<BR>
and I am very grateful to them.
<BR>
I just observe that one cannot afford to stay on the software
<BR>
forefront when running a service for thousands of users that should 
<BR>
never crash.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Now I have one server on 2.0.37 and other three on 2.0.36 and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; they are solid as rocks.  Can't run X on the one with 2.0.37,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; but this improves security :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I have 2.2.10 running rock-solid; glibc-2.1.1 and XFree86-3.3.3.1 run
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very well.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok, then perhaps we should try to be scientific and compare
<BR>
a few indicators about the machine load, so perhaps we understand
<BR>
something more. The machine that gave me problems with 2.2.x typically:
<BR>
- gives about 300-400 as output of 'netstat -n | wc -l'
<BR>
- 'Used' memory stays around 300MB (with 512 physical)
<BR>
In one month of uptime:
<BR>
- update (bdflush) collects about 120 minutes CPU 
<BR>
- about 12M pages in and 50M out  (from  'grep page  /proc/stat' )
<BR>
- about 250M context switches (from 'grep ctxt /proc/stat' )
<BR>
- about 350k processes created (from 'grep processes /proc/stat' )
<BR>
<P>The box looks far from being overloaded and I believe that these figures
<BR>
could be much higher.  But as a matter of fact I was not able to reach
<BR>
2.2.x stability in these conditions.
<BR>
I should also say that I have a lot of other things that demand
<BR>
my attention and I cannot spend the whole day to experiment with
<BR>
the boxes..
