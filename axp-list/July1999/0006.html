<EM>&gt; This one is more like a feeling than a bug report, but since upgrading to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RHL6.0 on my SX users have been experiencing strange mail problems. These
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problems appear, so far, to only relate to mail being forwarded from our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Netware server.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We are losing, wait for it, only _some_ mail and don't know why. Worked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fine on RHL5.2, but now it is not. I can't pin it down at all. There is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing in the maillog, when a message fails to arrive, and can't see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything on the Netware box either - however I have yet to figure out the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; path which appears to be quite involved going through one NW box possibly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; another Linux box and maybe even a Sun before it gets to my machine. It is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as if the message has not been sent, but it was!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So my question is... has anyone else seen any problems with RHL6.0 on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alpha? Or even the sendmail 8.9.3-10 package?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Dunno what the problem is, but remember the following while checking
<BR>
your logs:
<BR>
<P>1) Are you running nscd? There are a number of potential problems
<BR>
that people are encountering running nscd.
<BR>
<P>2) sendmail-8.9.3 uses smrsh. That means that any local mailer
<BR>
that are sometimes used by user agents must be found in /etc/smrsh.
<BR>
A symlink will do ...
