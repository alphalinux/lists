hmmm....
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apologies in advance if this message is formatted strangely - I'm
<BR>
having to write it using Outlook on
<BR>
an NT machine.
<BR>
<P>Briefly, summary of problem. My LX164 (from Compusys) had been running
<BR>
away happily
<BR>
for several months without a problem until yesterday when the qlogic
<BR>
isp1040 scsi controller
<BR>
started playing up (either that or its a problem with the driver in
<BR>
2.2.10, but seeing as i'd had
<BR>
35 days uptime with it, i doubt it). Anyway, I rebooted and actually
<BR>
turned the machine off
<BR>
for the first time this year. Now problems start. Previously I'd booted
<BR>
off a milo floppy from
<BR>
SRM - not a brilliant idea but i'd never got round to changing it. Today
<BR>
i found that the floppy
<BR>
drive had given up as well as the qlogic (probably got a lot to do with
<BR>
the amount of dust in
<BR>
the room, which has recently had the windows replaced and two walls
<BR>
removed!). This made
<BR>
me decide to switch to ARC/AlphaBios, as my primary system disk is ide
<BR>
(so i cant boot
<BR>
straight from srm). However, when following the (now outdated) links at
<BR>
digital's web site
<BR>
(www.windows.digital.com/support/sysopt.htp no longer exists), I can
<BR>
only see referenced
<BR>
AlphaBioses for specific dec systems. Does anyone know where to get
<BR>
something like
<BR>
a generic LX164 arc/alphabios?	
<BR>
<P>cheers
