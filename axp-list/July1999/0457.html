<P><EM>&gt; FWIW, here's the NetBSD boot messages which also say what it actually

<EM>&gt; to know whether this kernel (which is ELF based to could be loaded by

<P>Okay...it looks like you've got a really nice setup here...  From an initial scan of these boot messages, you
<BR>
have 6 KZPBA-CB adapters, each connected to a BA356/BA36R-type shelf which is fully populated with seven disks.
<BR>
You also have the internal NCR SCSI adapter, as well as (it appears) another NCR with two disks hanging off of
<BR>
it.  You have one DE500 ethernet card, as well as it appears, two RoadRunner HIPPI cards which are the only
<BR>
interesting thing out of this lot that I don't know if I can manage to rummage up.
<BR>
<P>It appears this system is actually an AS4000 (Durango/Wrangler), not a rawhide (AS4100) as I had first expected.
<BR>
But then...I have also gotten an durango to install from the RH 6.0 CD.  Could you re-send exactly where the
<BR>
install chokes for you - I seem to have deleted it.
<BR>
<P>I'm going to try building a current kernel with support for all these fun items (as well as serial console
<BR>
support), stick it on a boot disk, and see what I get.  I also took a look (finally) at what the kernel does
<BR>
after freeing the initial memory.  Here's the code, which becomes immediately self-evident, unfortunately:
<BR>
<P>static int init(void * unused)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lock_kernel();
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do_basic_setup();
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/*
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Ok, we have completed the initial bootup, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* we're essentially up and running. Get rid of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* initmem segments and start the user-mode stuff..
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*/
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;free_initmem();
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unlock_kernel();
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (open(&quot;/dev/console&quot;, O_RDWR, 0) &lt; 0)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printk(&quot;Warning: unable to open an initial console.\n&quot;);
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(void) dup(0);
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(void) dup(0);
<BR>
<P>....
<BR>
<P>My guess is that yes, the install kernel never intended to support serial console.  I'd call that an oversight if
<BR>
that's the case, but one that probably wouldn't happen again.  We'll see what happens - this shouldn't take too
<BR>
long...
