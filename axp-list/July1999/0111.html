<EM>&gt; My multia presently has no internal disk.  It is connected to a four
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bay SCSI box with one 3 gig disk (full height, two bays), an empty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bay (for cooling), and a CD-ROM drive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My choices for adding disk space seem to be:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1. Toss the 3 gig drive, and replace it with a 1/2 height larger capacity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     SCSI disk.  (I am cheap, I paid lots of money for the 3 gig disk 5 years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     ago and can not bear the thought of it sitting around collecting dust.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Maybe the 486 could use it...)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2. Get a SCSI box with more bays, and add more SCSI disks.  Seven
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     bay SCSI boxes seem to be fairly expensive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3. Add an internal 3.5&quot; SCSI or IDE drive.  People warn about heat problems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     in the multia that I don't want to learn about first hand.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4. Get an internal 2.5&quot; SCSI disk.  These are rare.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 5. Get an internal 2.5&quot; IDE disk.  A couple of places sell 6.4 gig for $190.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     The disk is slow (4200 RPM), but it is lots of space at a competitive price.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 6. Get a 2.5&quot; IDE and an IDE-to-SCSI converter.  Why?  It would cost $190 plus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     the card and the disk is still slow.  The converter isn't going to speed it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up any.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My best choice seems to be #1 or #5.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Am I missing something here?

<P>Since you are already working with an external box the easiest thing 
<BR>
is to get a bigger external box. While it is true that &quot;scsi&quot; 
<BR>
external boxes are expensive there is a cheaper solution. What I did 
<BR>
for one of our netware servers is take an extra pc tower case and use 
<BR>
that as an external scsi cdrom box in this case. Check one of the 
<BR>
cable places for a pc case rear slot cover that has an external scsi 
<BR>
connector on the outside and a male 50 pin connector on the inside. I 
<BR>
have a standard submini 50 pin scsi cable connected to the outside 
<BR>
and internally I have a standard 50 pin ribbon cable. Of course this 
<BR>
is all standard scsi but there is no reason you couldn't do the same 
<BR>
thing with fast or wide, just different connectors. I got the slot 
<BR>
cover adaptor at a local computer show, they had several different 
<BR>
styles. The adaptor was about $15 and a standard pc tower case is 
<BR>
down to $40 since ATX is taking over. Alot cheaper than any of the 
<BR>
official scsi boxes I have seen. Any one see any reason it wouldn't 
<BR>
work just as well? I have had &quot;official&quot; scsi boxes and there is 
<BR>
nothing special about them except maybe a dip switch for id setting.
