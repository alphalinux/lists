<EM>&gt;Do keep in mind the command was invalid. You can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;move a directory to itself. Normal mv's work OK.
</EM><BR>
<P>True, true. But if I examine the contents of the directory I find a
<BR>
partial duplicate of itself. So, &quot;mv&quot; apparently is trying to move the
<BR>
directory to itself and the error checking seems to fail, dumping core. 
<BR>
Pretty funny bug, if you ask me. Besides, do you really know _anyone_ that
<BR>
moves the whole contents of a directory to another directory
<BR>
within, file-by-file? Man, that's what mv * is for. :) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW, has this infernal inetd trap issue been fixed yet? I downloaded
<BR>
some source rpms that I found off of the archives that included patches to
<BR>
address the problem (thanks to whoever did it) but the patches don't apply
<BR>
cleanly nor does the source compile after application. I snagged the
<BR>
netkit update, but it doesn't seem to have fixed the problem. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess I don't have much room to complain. I didn't actually buy 6.0
<BR>
from redhat, but I did buy 3.0.3, 4.0, and 5.2. I figured I'd wait to pay
<BR>
for it until they actually released something that worked out of the box.
