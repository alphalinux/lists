&nbsp;&nbsp;Hokay. I'll admit to being wrong about the df stuff. I guess the 5%
<BR>
reserve has never been apparent to me as I've never been as concerned as I
<BR>
am now about space useage on my drive. 2 gig just isn't enough with 6.0 if
<BR>
you want space to burn cd's as well. :( 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As a sideline, does anyone know of a good place to grab one of the 533sx
<BR>
or lx mb/proc combos? I've been watching ebay lately and I haven't seen
<BR>
any good deals. Seems as most of them are single ones that end up getting
<BR>
bid way out of my price range.
