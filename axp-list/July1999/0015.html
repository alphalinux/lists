<P>
We've got an EB164 that I would like to upgrade
<BR>
from Red Hat Linux 5.0 to Red Hat Linux 6.0.
<BR>
<P>It already has MILO installed, so I tried to
<BR>
boot the Red Hat Linux 6.0 install boot floppy
<BR>
with &quot;boot fd0:vmlinux.gz&quot; at the MILO prompt.
<BR>
The kernel booted, but instead of asking for
<BR>
the ramdisk, it booted the Red Hat 5.0 
<BR>
installation on sda2!  Next I tried at the
<BR>
MILO prompt &quot;boot fd0:vmlinux.gz loadramdisk=1&quot;,
<BR>
but that had the same result.  I checked the 
<BR>
Alpha Installation Addendum for Red Hat 
<BR>
Linux 6.0 and it didn't seem to say to do 
<BR>
anything different?
<BR>
<P>Then I figured I'd try booting the MILO image
<BR>
from Red Hat Linux 6.0 and then boot the install
<BR>
from there.  I followed the instructions in
<BR>
the Alpha Installation Addendum for setting up
<BR>
the ARC Console, but it won't boot the MILO
<BR>
floppy, claiming that the OSLOADER &quot;\linload.exe&quot;
<BR>
doesn't exist.
<BR>
<P>I've recreated the disks several times and
<BR>
keep getting the same results.  I know I must
<BR>
be doing something wrong, but I can't figure
<BR>
out what it is.  As far as I can recall, I
<BR>
had no trouble upgrading this same EB164
<BR>
from Red Hat Linux 4.2 to Red Hat Linux 5.0
<BR>
a long time ago, but I seem to be stuck now.
<BR>
And I'm pretty sure I'm using the right images.
<BR>
<P>Help??
<BR>
<P>Thanks in advance.
