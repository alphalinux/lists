<EM>&gt; They look like uncorrectable ECC errors to me. Since Linux 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything DIA or UERF it's kinda of hard to say for sure.
</EM><BR>
<P>It doesn't *yet*!  Warning: shameless plug to follow....
<BR>
<P>Compaq Analyze is the successor to DECevent and I'm the DRI for getting this
<BR>
ported to Linux/Alpha.  It is targeted for EV6 platforms and beyond but in
<BR>
general will work with binary error logging that supports the &quot;new&quot; Common
<BR>
Event Header.  This is already working cross-platform on Tru64, O-VMS,
<BR>
WNT/Alpha (and Intel but it can't process live error logging for fairly
<BR>
obvious reasons) with about 90% common code.  That's because most of it's
<BR>
Java with some breakouts to C/C++ for the stuff that's truly native.  The
<BR>
challenge on Linux is the conspicuous lack of binary error logging,
<BR>
something we are addressing.
<BR>
<P>This group is symbiotic with our efforts.  Those of you missing a DIA or
<BR>
UERF (let's be fair, these are radically different--the latter just dumps
<BR>
stuff in barely human readable form) on Linux may be benefited by our tool
<BR>
when it comes out.  But you folks can be useful to us as well: Linux is a
<BR>
tough beastie compared to our other OSes because of how little control we
<BR>
have on its guts.  Instead of relying on people we pay to get things done we
<BR>
ultimately have to rely on one smart guy from Finland.  It's a different
<BR>
world!
<BR>
<P>So, work with us on this.  Your help is appreciated!
<BR>
<P>Greg.
