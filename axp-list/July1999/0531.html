hmm..
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope someone can shed some light on this 'cos it's got
<BR>
me completely confused! Until last Thursday I had a shiny
<BR>
working LX164 (600MHz/512Mb RAM, 6.4Gb IBM udma ide
<BR>
disk, qlogic isp scsi w/quantum viking, symbios 53c810 w/
<BR>
cdrom, de435) which i'd happily taken up the development
<BR>
track from 2.1.100 (ish) to 2.2.10. Hadn't yet started on 2.3.
<BR>
It was based on RH5.1 but had been heavily upgraded. 5 
<BR>
days ago I started getting lots of errors from the qlogic
<BR>
card with the driver timing out and it failing to find data. I
<BR>
shut the box down and cleaned it, evicting several spiders
<BR>
in the process (guess they were sheltering from all the
<BR>
building work going on round here, which also explains
<BR>
several inches of dust inside the cab).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon restarting the system, things got weird. I use
<BR>
SRM &amp; milo boot floppy. Booted up. fine. tried to boot
<BR>
2.2.10. Gets to unzipping, says &quot;done&quot; and then the
<BR>
box reboots. Keep trying. Fortunately I've got about 40
<BR>
kernel images in / which i nearly cleared out but never
<BR>
did. Finally I find that 2.1.131 will actually boot. Further
<BR>
testing reveals the following -
<BR>
<P>Can't boot any kernel from 2.1.31 ac 11 onwards: these
<BR>
either autoreboot after unzipping, report &quot;length error-halting&quot;
<BR>
or occasionally pop up an unaligned trap error and freeze.
<BR>
Can't get anything from the magic sysrq key. kernels
<BR>
2.0.35 (as came with the box), and 2.1.X (x &gt; 119, didn't
<BR>
go back any further) all work happily. As I mentioned,
<BR>
all of these kernels worked before (apart from 2.2.8, which
<BR>
I compiled but never booted 'cos 2.2.9 came out a couple
<BR>
of days later) and I'd avoided all the problems other
<BR>
people seemed to have had - no oopses, uptimes of 40
<BR>
days+ (mainly terminated by upgrading to the next kernel).
<BR>
<P>So, what on earth could be causing this behaviour? The
<BR>
only clue i can really gather is that 2.1.131 works and
<BR>
131ac11 doesn't. I seem to remember that Richard
<BR>
Henderson put in a lot of changes relating to MILO and
<BR>
linux's detection of hardware/system types from it at
<BR>
this point. As my milo is quite old (22/9/97  - it's in
<BR>
the &quot;latest&quot; directory at gatekeeper, but it's a lot older
<BR>
than the ones at redhat) this might be a problem. But
<BR>
then again, they worked before, with the same MILO.
<BR>
<P>Anyone anywhere have a clue what could cause this
<BR>
or is it finally time for me to rebuild from scratch? 
<BR>
(mind you, i must admit, i really liked 2.1.131, but
<BR>
it does constrain future development a bit!!)
<BR>
<P>cheers
