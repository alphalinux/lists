<P>
i did a find ... grep of arch/alpha and when i saw that dik_show_code
<BR>
printed out all the registers i realised i was in trouble.
<BR>
<P>I posted two oops to the list. Do you have any idea what could be causing
<BR>
it?
<BR>
Unfortunately the oops isn't very complete as it actually seems to oops'ing
<BR>
in the code responsible for printing out the relevant oops info... :( (how
<BR>
can that happen?)
<BR>
<P>You say &quot;already mostly dead.&quot;: the machine is still running perfectly! the
<BR>
only thing that happens is that the calling process, cdrecord, segfaults
<BR>
with a ENOMEM. And modprobe Oopses if sg is a module. (see my other post
<BR>
&quot;Alpha oops in modprobe - devfs related?&quot;). 
<BR>
<P>I really want to try and figure this one out as i really want to cdrecord
<BR>
working on my new Yamaha cd-rw.. both cdrecord-1.6 and 1.8 segfault with a
<BR>
memory allocation error. i fiddled furiously with ulimit and set cdrecord's
<BR>
buffer size to 0 - no difference.
<BR>
<P>Do you have any suggestions/ideas as to what i can do to get it to work, or
<BR>
to get more debugging info? The modprobe oops makes me suspect it might be
<BR>
to do with devfs, but devfs has worked reliably for me on intel since i
<BR>
started using it circa january, and havn't had any problems so far with it
<BR>
on Alpha (~2/3 months). Or perhaps it's a bug in Alpha module handling?
<BR>
<P>thanks,
<BR>
<P>Paul Jakma.

<EM>&gt; &gt; They're not in any of my i386 kernels. What are they, and do they

<EM>&gt; The dik_* functions are part of die_if_kernel.  If you've
