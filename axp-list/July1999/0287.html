<P>
John,
<BR>
<P>At first I thought &quot;Ya got me!&quot;  But after looking at the site I feel a bit
<BR>
vindicated.  They state clearly that Free-VMS is an OpenVMS *look-alike*.
<BR>
So is it really VMS?  You have to decide.  Fairly similar to the Linux
<BR>
question.  Linux isn't really UNIX but in some ways it out-UNIXes UNIX!
<BR>
There's alway some bozo out there willing to port some OS or application to
<BR>
his own platform.  I personally am not too excited about VMS but even less
<BR>
so with regards to Intel!  For one thing this is someone's pet project; I
<BR>
don't see anything to do with Digital/Compaq on it.
<BR>
<P>I think this line is particularly interesting:
<BR>
&quot;Discussion: one of the goals for Free-VMS is not only to get VMS on PC's.
<BR>
Other architectures should be considered (I've always dreamed of baffling
<BR>
some SunOS-weenie by starting VMS on his favorite hardware :-)).&quot;
<BR>
<P>So we're to infer that we just do these things because they can be done or
<BR>
as this person points out, to poke jabs at others.  Isn't this a bit
<BR>
infantile?  I see this more as recreation: you climb a mountain for some
<BR>
personal sense of accomplishment not to save the world or at least
<BR>
contribute something productive.  There's a difference between doing
<BR>
something for your own satisfaction and producing something that people
<BR>
really want!
<BR>
<P>I suppose there are some out there who can't bear to see VMS finally bite it
<BR>
but GET OVER IT!  I loved Amigas till I finally realized no company
<BR>
(especially Commodore) was ever going to make it competitive.  Do we really
<BR>
want VMS ported to SPARC, MIPS, PPC, etc.?  Someone's porting Linux to CE
<BR>
devices and, while I like my little HP Jornada 820 I can't see much point of
<BR>
putting Linux on it other than to rub MS's nose in it.  WinCE serves its
<BR>
purpose in providing small but useful apps to tiny devices, though I admit I
<BR>
didn't care about yet-another-WinOS until I got this beastie.  Linux &quot;lacks&quot;
<BR>
(don't slaughter me on this word--Linux is just not yet gaining much
<BR>
interest in the desktop and IMHO *won't* until it can coexist as both a
<BR>
hacker's environment and a commercially viable product; AFAIK a Netscape
<BR>
browser still is not available for Linux/Alpha unless you count Mozilla
<BR>
which if I recall was an early version of Netscape) the basic kinds of apps
<BR>
that are central to WinCE.
<BR>
<P>I'm not hammering anyone here, I just want to inspire the thought that just
<BR>
because something *can* be done does not necessarily make it important to
<BR>
do.
<BR>
<P>The defense rests.

<EM>&gt; 	&gt;Anyway, would you *really* want VMS on Intel?

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; Try www.free-vms.org. Someone obviously does!
