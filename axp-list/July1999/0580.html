Hi,

<P><EM>&gt; I saw something yesterday that said there was a problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the 2.2.5 kernel on the RH6.0 dist when booting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on a DS20. There was mention of problems with the NCR scsi
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; driver. The solution was build a boot floppy with a newer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kernel, eg 2.2.10. If you don't have a another Linux/Alpha system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you may have a problem.

</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; That's my problem.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Are there any compiled kernels around that could work?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I got this yesterday, from an internal source:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The problem with the 6.0 CD installation for the DS20 is that it loads the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wrong SCSI driver first and tries to use it.  It needs to use the Symbios
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;driver not the NCR driver.  RedHat is aware of the problem, there are other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;issues with the 2.2.5 kernel (which is what is on the CD) as well.  You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should download a copy of the 2.2.10 kernel (I think that their is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;internal site for the binary form)  and make a kernel floppy.  Then you need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to use:
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  boot dva0 -file vmlinux.gz -flags &quot;boot_device=/dev/fd0 root=/dev/scd0&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  This will tell it to get the kernel from the floppy but boot the CDROM.
</EM><BR>
<P>This worked for me on a DS20. I've placed this vmlinux.gz out on our
<BR>
anonymous server xfer-alf.service.digital.com  - once logged in, do a
<BR>
&quot;cd to_customer&quot; and then you can do a get on &quot; vmlinuz-2.2.10-DS20 &quot;
<BR>
and that should allow you to boot once you use rawrite (from RedHat 6.0
<BR>
cd-rom under dosutils) or dd if from UNIX/Linux to put it on a floppy. 
<BR>
<P>I picked up 
<BR>
<P>-rw-r--r--   1 root     root     58767360 Jul 27 16:08 linux-2.2.10.tar
<BR>
<P>Note the size (whoa!!), 13MB gzipped, but I've not yet been able to build 
<BR>
an image that I have been able to use to boot the DS20. I'm still working
<BR>
on that. It will let me build the usual stuff, like &quot;make boot&quot; , but I've 
<BR>
still got some problem where it won't let me do a make bzImage, maybe I 
<BR>
don't have bzip or something installed? I'll keep working on that. 
<BR>
<P>I do not have 1GB of memory, but someone replied that they have 2GB
<BR>
of physical memory, and had no problems getting it installed. 
<BR>
<P>My DS20 is configured with the following :
<BR>
<P>AlphaServer DS20 500 MHz
<BR>
<P>KZPCM == Dual Ultra-SCSI / Tulip ethernet combo 
<BR>
<P>Elsa Gloria graphics adapter/ Linux sees as TVP4020 Permedia2, and
<BR>
this uses the 3Dlabs Xserver. 
<BR>
<P>Hope this helps!!
