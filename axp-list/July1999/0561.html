Thanks to everyone who responded with helpful suggestions - and there
<BR>
were a good number of you - on how to get a brand-new RH 6.0 install on a 
<BR>
Multia to allow root access. After a number
<BR>
of clean reinstallations and much digging through /etc by local Unix- and
<BR>
Linux-qualified people, the system is now willing to acknowledge the
<BR>
existence of a root password. The solution may have been to NOT
<BR>
install with either MD5 or shadow passwords. (Unfortunately I can't thank
<BR>
the axp-list contributor who suggested that as I accidentally deleted his
<BR>
e-mail message. Stupid Mac.)
<BR>
<P>However, it is still (I say &quot;still,&quot; but for some reason I neglected to
<BR>
mention this in my original post - apologies) hanging up on all tty users
<BR>
after a 35-40 second interval, be they console, telnet, or root. Logging
<BR>
in through an xterm works fine, however. Just to make things more
<BR>
interesting, the date command returns a different date every time it is
<BR>
invoked. I don't know if this stuff is related to the earlier problem, but
<BR>
I do _know_ it all started after I first installed 6.0.
<BR>
<P>Thanks.
