&nbsp;&nbsp;Hokay.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I scored a 366 and alphapc 164 motherboard combo. I know that it has an
<BR>
atx form factor, but net research shows that it won't work out of the box
<BR>
with a standard atx power supply. I found a website that talks about how
<BR>
to rig (I'm assuming) either the board or the powersupply so that the
<BR>
powersupply sees a PSION signal and stays on. I don't have a problem using
<BR>
the ole turn-off-the-machine-at-the-strip method, I do it anyway. So, for
<BR>
those of you that have done this, I want to verify the procedure so I
<BR>
don't smoke anything. All I really need to do is ground pin 14 from the
<BR>
atx connector, right? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, regarding the memory for these critters. All the research that I
<BR>
have done suggests that 72 pin fpm parity memory will work in these, i.e.
<BR>
the same memory that a multia or alphastation 200 uses. I hope so - I'd
<BR>
hate to have to sell 96 meg of the hard-to-aquire parity memory that I
<BR>
have in my as 200. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The board also has an onboard ide controller. Does this work okay? I
<BR>
know that the IDE alpha support in the past was flakey at best, has this
<BR>
changed? I'd love to be able to take the few 1+ gig ide drives that I have
<BR>
lying around and use them in conjunction with my scsi drive. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, that's it.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric
