<P>
Yes, I have used this method before, ie ground pin 14 (PS_ON)  - or you
<BR>
can also short it to pin 15 which is a ground pin.
<BR>
<P>Seems to work ok.  I use the switch on the back of the power supply as
<BR>
the on/off switch for the machine.  On the RAM side, standard 36-bit,
<BR>
72pin parity RAM seems to work for me.  You can either use 4 of these
<BR>
(128bit bus mode) or 8 (to have 256 bit bus mode).  Have not tried the
<BR>
IDE controller.  But I don't think it's a problem...
<BR>
<P>Hope this helps &amp; have fun.  
<BR>
<P>Rgds.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Hokay.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I scored a 366 and alphapc 164 motherboard combo. I know that it has an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;atx form factor, but net research shows that it won't work out of the box
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with a standard atx power supply. I found a website that talks about how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to rig (I'm assuming) either the board or the powersupply so that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;powersupply sees a PSION signal and stays on. I don't have a problem using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the ole turn-off-the-machine-at-the-strip method, I do it anyway. So, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;those of you that have done this, I want to verify the procedure so I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't smoke anything. All I really need to do is ground pin 14 from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;atx connector, right? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Also, regarding the memory for these critters. All the research that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have done suggests that 72 pin fpm parity memory will work in these, i.e.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the same memory that a multia or alphastation 200 uses. I hope so - I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hate to have to sell 96 meg of the hard-to-aquire parity memory that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have in my as 200. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  The board also has an onboard ide controller. Does this work okay? I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;know that the IDE alpha support in the past was flakey at best, has this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;changed? I'd love to be able to take the few 1+ gig ide drives that I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lying around and use them in conjunction with my scsi drive. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Anyway, that's it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Thanks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
