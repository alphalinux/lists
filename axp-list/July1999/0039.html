<P>
I suspect that my AlphaStation has suffered heat death and want to replace
<BR>
the CPU.  Can anyone sell me one of these?  This is one of the old Onsale 
<BR>
AlphaStation 200 4/166's with a 166MHz 21064A in it.
<BR>
<P>Please respond via email--i will give preference to vendors who do not bug
<BR>
the list with their ads.  If you also want a 21064A or a copy of all the
<BR>
ads i receive, email me.  i'll post a summary to the list if there is a
<BR>
lot of interest.
<BR>
<P>The long story, if you want to disagree with my diagnosis, is:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;o i discovered the CPU fan inlet was basically completely clogged with 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dust.  the problem began when we started having hot weather.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;o i returned from a week-long trip to find the machine halted at
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``machine check in PAL code'' or something.  upon reboot,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;o the LED's indicated ``SCSI controller failure'' and it wouldn't boot
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or echo anything to the serial console.  once i got it to boot, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it stayed up for a day, but this was a freak accident it seems.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;o the last time it machine-checked, it wouldn't reboot.  i jabbed the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reset button about ten times in rapid succession, and that seemed 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to fry it totally.  i now get all eight LED's on, no change in 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LED pattern from powerup on.  This is the same behaviour i 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;observe if i remove the CPU.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for your help, all.  
<BR>
<P>To those of you who have working AS200's, I suggest you take off the front
<BR>
faceplate (easy.  no screws or wires, just four plastic tabs) and clean
<BR>
dust off the CPU fan inlet about once a year.
<BR>
