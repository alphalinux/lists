Yeah, I've been looking for the same, but I guess its good that they are
<BR>
getting bid up from an alpha advocacy standpoint, it means more people are
<BR>
turning to the alpha, and that is a good thing. Too bad they can't just like
<BR>
overlook a few of the boxes for those of us that need to grab a new one but
<BR>
don't really have the cash to pay for a new one :)

Subject: df and such
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;   Hokay. I'll admit to being wrong about the df stuff. I guess the 5%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reserve has never been apparent to me as I've never been as concerned as I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; am now about space useage on my drive. 2 gig just isn't enough with 6.0 if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you want space to burn cd's as well.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   As a sideline, does anyone know of a good place to grab one of the 533sx
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or lx mb/proc combos? I've been watching ebay lately and I haven't seen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any good deals. Seems as most of them are single ones that end up getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bid way out of my price range.
