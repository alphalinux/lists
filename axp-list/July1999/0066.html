<P>
System: Ruffian UX4, Diamond FireGL1000Pro, off the shelf RH6.0
<BR>
<P>Thanks to those who suggested skipping the symlink and going straight to the
<BR>
_explicit_ kernel file name (either of /boot/vmlinu[zx]-2.2.5-16) on the
<BR>
milo boot line. Both files work OK, I didn't bother trying the symlink
<BR>
again to see if my failure had mysteriously disappeared.
<BR>
<P>Since then I've got inittab to get me into both 3 and 5 correctly, but have
<BR>
several problems.
<BR>
<P>1) ping doesn't work - byte 8 seems to be a random number.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_But_ rsh, rlogin, ftp, nfs etc are fine.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember previous messages about ping and packing/alignment, but am
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unable to http/ftp to the outside world atm. Do I need a patched version
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of ping? (*)
<BR>
<P>2) Gnome gives me 2 core files every time I log on (both my PC and my Alpha
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do this), and I don't like the ammount of memory it eats, so I'd rather
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go back to plain simple fvwm2. To do this, I have a .xsession file
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;containing xterm&amp;; xearth&amp;; fvwm2 and no more. On the PC, this is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fine and I get. On the PC everything's OK, on the Alpha I get an xearth,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but no other windows, and no menus on my mouse. Nothing I run from the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text-mode console ever appears on the screen. i.e. it's useless.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any suggestions? I'm confused.
<BR>
<P>3) When I C-A-backspace out of X, or I've killed certain X programs
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e.g. the window manager) (i.e. when the above problem has left me no
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;option) x respawns in a rapid loop, failing each time with a message
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about xdm being murdered mysteriously. This sends my monitor into fits,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until x respawning is disabled by init. What should I do to exit a deaf,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mute and blind X session?
<BR>
<P>4) Sometimes I try `telinit -t 1 3` to go from 5 to 3. This disappears up
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its own arse. I can sometimes go to 1, and then to 3. Erm?
<BR>
<P><P>So I'm happy as I now have 1600x1200x32 @ 84 Hz on my big monitor, but I'm
<BR>
still not the fluffiest bunny in the field.
<BR>
<P>(*) Actually, is there a list of (s)rpms which have been updated since
<BR>
RH6.0? It would make sense to monitor the list regularly.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for your time,
<BR>
Phil
