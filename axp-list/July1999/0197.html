Hello All,
<BR>
Not to sure if this is a newsgroup or how we are supposed to input 
<BR>
questions but here is mine. I'm running an alpha box with Linux release 5.1 
<BR>
(kernel 2.0.34). It was built back east and had the EDT timezone. Since I'm 
<BR>
on the Pacific coast I reset the timezone correctly and edited the time 
<BR>
(through x-windows). When I rebooted the machine the time went to July 
<BR>
1978, I reset the time, rebooted and it did the exact same thing. I usually 
<BR>
don't use any gui environment but thought I'd try it this time because what 
<BR>
little documentation I have suggested doing it this way. Does anyone know 
<BR>
what the problem is? I'm using the alpha as a mail server, for some reason 
<BR>
now the headers have changed, instead of giving just the domain it now 
<BR>
gives the machine name and the domain. Any help is appreciated, I'm new to 
<BR>
the alpha platform.
<BR>
thanks,
<BR>
jim wilson

<P><P>Well I seem to have found the local problem.  My machine was a 533
<BR>
overclocked to 600 Mhz.  I brought that back down to 533 and all my
<BR>
crash problems have gone away.  Kernel compiles go smoothly, I was
<BR>
able to load my machine up over 6 for an hour without difficulty, all
<BR>
manner of X usage with no X crashes, etc.
<BR>
<P>Still running 2.2.7.  The bulk of my troubles seem to have been
<BR>
related to overclocking.  Either coincidental with the RH6.0 upgrade,
<BR>
or somehow the newer kernels trip something the older ones did not.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for the assistance.
<BR>
