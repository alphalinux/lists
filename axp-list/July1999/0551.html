<P>
I am running Apache 1.3.6 and MySQL 3.21.xx on a Redhat 5.2,  AlphaStation
<BR>
500. The server is hosting a medium traffic website (circa 50k
<BR>
pageviews/day)
<BR>
<P>Until today, the server uptime was at 68 days. I have re-booted it just now
<BR>
due to irregular behaviour :
<BR>
1. I have to re-start my MySQL server like every once/day - either the
<BR>
server has mysteriously died, or multiple instances of server was initiated;
<BR>
2. My syslogd died mysteriously, even though multiple attempts were made to
<BR>
restart it everyday;
<BR>
3. And the last straw is when i find out my console screen is filled with
<BR>
Error messages such as multiple (kernel, FTP, httpd) memory violation and
<BR>
similar other undecipherable messages &amp; characters.
<BR>
<P>Looking through the server logs, the only sign of anything abnormal (which
<BR>
was recorded) was the entries below:
<BR>
<P>/var/log/kernel:Jul 16 19:30:51 xxxxx kernel: httpd: memory violation at
<BR>
pc=120085ab4 rp=120085a7c (bad address = 00000000) 
<BR>
/var/log/kernel:Jul 19 14:22:19 xxxxx kernel: httpd: memory violation at
<BR>
pc=12009ca38 rp=12009ca0c (bad address = 1202cde80) 
<BR>
<P>For the life of me, I do not know what the above means :) apart from a
<BR>
memory violation error (duh!). However, the dates do indicate to me that
<BR>
these might be the start as the problems above cropped up just about that
<BR>
time.
<BR>
<P>Do you think this was just a one-off isolated case? Or is it there's
<BR>
something terribly wrong with my server?
<BR>
<P>Any feedbacks, opinions, suggestions, etc. is greatly appreciated
<BR>
<P>Thanks in advance
<BR>
