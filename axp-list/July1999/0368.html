After a little delay I present to you;
<BR>
<P>TOP 10 REASONS WHY ALPHA'S ARE GREAT.	
<BR>
<P>10.	It is a pretty chip archetecture.
<BR>
9.	It isn't intel.  
<BR>
8.	Alpha's have a large primary and secondary cache resulting in
<BR>
goobs of speed.
<BR>
7. 	SPEED.
<BR>
6.	Faster Floating point math.
<BR>
5.	High precision engineering calculations.
<BR>
4.	Better encryption (resulting from faster math).
<BR>
3.	The ability to use sparse address space.  (?)
<BR>
2.	Large database applications benefit from the 64 bit memory
<BR>
space.
<BR>
1.	A 50 mHz oscilator matches the frequency of my hand when I
<BR>
&quot;really get going&quot; on penguin mints.
<BR>
<P>AND the Zero-th reason why Alpha's are Great is:
<BR>
<P>0.	SPEED
<BR>
<P>Thank you to everyone out there that responded.  If you want more
<BR>
information, all of the responses are below.

<BR>
<P>32 bit math is in general insufficient to support large commerce
<BR>
applications(and some not so small ones to). Just think 32 bits can
<BR>
equal 
<BR>
21,474,836.48 dollars or rubels or yen but 92,233,720,368,547,758.08
<BR>
should be big enough for all those but Bill Gates:).
<BR>
<P>medium to large database applications can now get up into the gigabyte
<BR>
sizes quite easly and with system memory prices droping it is quite
<BR>
reasonable that systems may want to run with more than 2Gb of ram. I
<BR>
worked on a medium size web site that ended up using 1Gb of ram for the
<BR>
system running the database.
<BR>
<P>encryption quite often uses multi-pricision math. this is faster with a
<BR>
64
<BR>
bit processor. A 32 bit processor can take up to 10 operations to
<BR>
perform
<BR>
the equivilent of a 64x64 multiply.

<P><P><P>Alphas have many benefits over Intel (about as many as Intel has over
<BR>
Alpha).  Generally, there is MUCH more of a difference between an Alpha
<BR>
processor and an Intel processor than just clock speeds.  For instance,
<BR>
I
<BR>
personally prefer programming on RISC machines (Alpha, MIPS, PowerPC,
<BR>
etc) for many reasons that I won't get into.  Intel's 80x86 processors
<BR>
are
<BR>
all CISC (later models have a RISC core, I believe, but it's still
<BR>
accessed through CISC means) and, while this can be a benefit at times,
<BR>
it
<BR>
can also be a royal pain at other times.
<BR>
<P>Secondly, Alphas have FAR superiour floating point performance, even
<BR>
compared to an Intel with the same clock speed.  For instance, my old
<BR>
UDB
<BR>
ran at 166MHz, which was equivalent to a Pentium 75-100 in terms of
<BR>
overall performance, BUT this same little machine with terrible memory
<BR>
bus
<BR>
bandwidth always bested our Pentium Pro 180 in terms of floating point
<BR>
calculations (that's real-life performance, not benchmark).  Now that
<BR>
I've
<BR>
stepped up to a 164SX w/533MHz 21164PC, I've yet to encounter even a
<BR>
Pentium II-class processor which can outperform it in floating
<BR>
point-intensive applications (to give you an idea, I'm averaging 10.5
<BR>
hrs
<BR>
on a seti@home packet...and this machine is considered to be &quot;low end&quot;
<BR>
by
<BR>
modern Alpha standards).  Not bad for a machine that I only paid $500
<BR>
for
<BR>
:-)
<BR>
<P>Of course, Linux on Alphas is still in the &quot;getting serious&quot; stage, to
<BR>
be
<BR>
honest.  Digital UNIX's compilers and tools for the Alpha produce vastly
<BR>
superiour binaries that average between 20-50% better performance
<BR>
compared
<BR>
to Linux-compiled versions (for obvious reasons...DEC invented these
<BR>
things, so writing compilers for it is easier for them).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; do the program's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in use utilize the 64 bit technology effectively?  
</EM><BR>
<P>Which brings me to my last point: true 64-bit operations and 64-bit
<BR>
general purpose registers (it's about time).  Any software that's
<BR>
properly
<BR>
coded (basically, it should be portable and not rely on fixed type
<BR>
sizes)
<BR>
can immediately take advantage of the benefits of 64-bit machines,
<BR>
including Alpha.  Of course, porting applications can be a pain, but I
<BR>
personally love doing it (which is why I keep buying Alphas...to port
<BR>
packages for Debian).  I don't know how much programming that you do
<BR>
personally, but you'd be amazed at the performance hits that an Intel
<BR>
machine takes to manipulate large amounts of 64-bit data.  Alphas don't
<BR>
suffer from this at all.  The downside, of course, is that stricter
<BR>
alignment rules must be adhered to at all costs (to work around them
<BR>
costs
<BR>
you DEARLY in cycles).
<BR>
<P>In all, I love working on my Alphas and use them for just about
<BR>
everything
<BR>
that I like to do (short of games...which I still keep a Windows PC
<BR>
around
<BR>
for).  A few years ago, when I started on Alphas, I would've told you
<BR>
that
<BR>
you shouldn't get an Alpha unless you liked living on the edge and
<BR>
pushing
<BR>
the envelope (Linux-wise, that is...Digital UNIX was always rock-solid),
<BR>
but these days, I consider it to be a stable platform for many
<BR>
applications.

<BR>
64-bit vs 32-bit plays a large role in the ability to use sparse address

spaces among other things

<BR>
<P><P>Why alpha?
<BR>
<P>Several reasons:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mostly faster clock rates, but also orders of magnitudes larger
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;primary and secondary CPU caches.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64 bit applications are in use, but also 64 bit kernels solve
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a lot of other problems more gracefully than synthetic 64 bit
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;values.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very much nicer chip and MMU architecture.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An instruction set that makes sense and doesn't haul around a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ridiculous notion of 'modes' for legacy reasons.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, like even supporting Sparc still, Intel should not be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allowed to have it all.
<BR>

<P>__________________________________________________________
<BR>
<P><P><P>Its a combination of reasons for us.  We do biological database
<BR>
searching
<BR>
and a 533Mhz Alpha is faster than a 550Mhz Intel and at current prices
<BR>
the
<BR>
Alpha is cheaper.  That being said, the difference is only around
<BR>
30-40%,
<BR>
where the fun really starts is when we use a 64 bit coding technique
<BR>
called microparallelism which allows you to treat the Alpha chip as a
<BR>
small SIMD system, we achieve around 8 times the performance of standard
<BR>
32 bit code through this method and I have been awarded a Royal Society
<BR>
of
<BR>
Edinburgh/Scottish Enterprise fellowship to sell the resulting code.  We
<BR>
are going to sell linux-axp systems preinstalled with RedHat and our
<BR>
software as a turnkey solution for labs wanting to perform
<BR>
Smith/Waterman database searches at speeds which would require &gt;10 Intel
<BR>
550Mhz boxes.  That is why we use Alphas.

Linux, a better WinNT than WinNT
<BR>
<P>__________________________________________________________
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;use alpha because I do some reasonably complex modeling of chemical
<BR>
kinetics (in C).  I need high precision when running numerical
<BR>
integration
<BR>
techniques but must still be able to run many, many iterations.  With 64
<BR>
bits, I can use single precision floating point in place of double
<BR>
precision, giving me an added speed advantage without sacrificing
<BR>
precision, or I can be more precise by sticking with double and not
<BR>
sacrifice speed.

<P><P>1. After a 8 bit Z80, an 16/32 bit MC68000, the next logical step is a
<BR>
64 bit processor.
<BR>
2. A processor with a lot of registers comes in handey when writing
<BR>
assembly programs.
<BR>
3. I do not want a mainstream Intel compatible processor.
<BR>
<P>Most programs do not use 64 bit technology effectively. But some
<BR>
programs can get a major performance boost when using 64-bit technology
<BR>
(example the game of life by Conway can be twice as fast when everything
<BR>
stays the same except for the register size going from 32 to 64 bit).
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Greetings,
<BR>
<P>I use Alpha for engineering simulations because of floating-point speed
<BR>
relative to Intel.  I don't know the details, but I think it has
<BR>
something to do with the number of registers, in addition to the clock
<BR>
speed- for egcs-compiled code.
<BR>
<P>If you can code in asm, then Alpha really shines.  Kazushige Goto has
<BR>
written some amazing linear algebra routines that I use on a daily basis
<BR>
which take advantage of Alpha's quad-issue capability, i.e. four
<BR>
instructions per cycle, and they run at about 3/4 of the theoretical
<BR>
maximum speed of the processor, about 760 MFlops for a $2K 533 MHz 21164
<BR>
box.  It simply blows away everything else in price/performance, by a
<BR>
very long way!
<BR>
<P>Also in this category are the fast math libraries, such as libffm (free
<BR>
fast math) by Joachim Wesner and K. Goto, and the Compaq Portable Math
<BR>
Library, both of which are very fast.
<BR>
<P>When the Compaq compilers for Linux are released (late summer/early
<BR>
fall), Alpha will become even more appealing...
<BR>
