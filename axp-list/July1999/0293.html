<EM>&gt;   BTW, has this infernal inetd trap issue been fixed yet? I downloaded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some source rpms that I found off of the archives that included patches to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; address the problem (thanks to whoever did it) but the patches don't apply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cleanly nor does the source compile after application. I snagged the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; netkit update, but it doesn't seem to have fixed the problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   I guess I don't have much room to complain. I didn't actually buy 6.0
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from redhat, but I did buy 3.0.3, 4.0, and 5.2. I figured I'd wait to pay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for it until they actually released something that worked out of the box.

<P>I didn't pay for RH6.0 either cause I expected some flakiness in a
<BR>
*.0 release. I am a bit surprised there are alignment traps though
<BR>
in basic packages. Someone should have caught that before it was
<BR>
released. Richard Henderson posted some patches a while back to
<BR>
fix some of it. I haven't had a show stopper yet so I haven't
<BR>
dug thru the source and tried to fix it.
