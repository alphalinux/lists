<i>&gt;At this time it </i><br>
<i>&gt;looks at though the egcs movement might become something like XEmacs</i><br>
<i>&gt;and Emacs, GNU won't accept them.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not an expert on the XEmacs/Emacs issue, but from what I've<br>
read and recall on the topic, I'd say it is characterized by a<br>
notably greater "divide" between the FSF (the organization that<br>
officially runs Project GNU) and the XEmacs people than is<br>
characterized by the gcc/egcs situation.<br>
<p>
There are some similarities in that the two pairs of project<br>
share similarly differing priorities and models of development.<br>
<p>
However, I believe XEmacs put certain things the FSF considered<br>
crucial at way too low of a priority -- perhaps including<br>
maintaining good tty (non-X) behavior and getting copyrights<br>
of non-trivial submissions signed over to the FSF -- for the FSF<br>
to feel comfortable trying to work very hard to prevent a long-term<br>
split between the projects.<br>
<p>
I'm not aware of any such "drops" of important priority in<br>
the egcs project.  Some changes in priority are evident, of course,<br>
but the biggest differences I've seen are often in the<br>
*execution* of various aspects of the project.<br>
<p>
At this point I don't believe the egcs' project team<br>
priorities are unacceptable to the FSF (e.g. I think they're<br>
insisting on copyright signovers for the FSF as does gcc2),<br>
though they might not entirely fit the FSF's ideas of<br>
priorities.  (That's okay; it's rare to find *any* GNU<br>
project being undertaken using the exact same priority list<br>
that the FSF wants, I would think.  The FSF is not in a<br>
position to insist on conformity, although it tries to<br>
persuade its people using verbage that can seem as if it<br>
is trying to require conformity.)<br>
<p>
Nor do I believe the egcs' project team's clearly superior execution<br>
in at least some areas of the development and release process<br>
(e.g. creating and distributing integrating test suites for<br>
various languages, making snapshots and CVS access publically<br>
available, providing various forms of distribution tailored to<br>
common user needs, rapidly responding to and integrating submitted<br>
patches) is likely to provide the FSF with any reason to insist<br>
on keeping its gcc distinct from egcs.<br>
<p>
One thing that is unclear at this point is just how well gcc2 will<br>
keep up with egcs in terms of incorporating patches from egcs.<br>
<p>
The difference in patch-acceptance rates is fairly astonishing<br>
to me, as a casual observer of egcs with a fair amount of<br>
experience on gcc2.  E.g. I could submit patches, or technical<br>
questions, to gcc2 and wait what seemed like ages for any response<br>
or actual incorporation of the patch (by which time I might be<br>
no longer well-suited to respond to queries accompanying<br>
rejections).  On egcs, I've submitted basically no patches, and<br>
yet had lots of patches I made to *g77* quickly and happily picked<br>
up by the egcs maintainer.  (This was during the initial phase<br>
of egcs development, so it could have been a "honeymoon" period<br>
in both technical and psychological ways, but the happy attitude<br>
on the part of the egcs maintainer persists to this day.)<br>
<p>
So gcc2 "merging" into the egcs development process (by picking up<br>
egcs patches as they're deemed "proven" in the field) might be roughly<br>
as challenging as a horse-drawn buggy trying to merge into<br>
a German autobahn with lots of traffic going at least 150kph.<br>
<p>
Another concern, more overtly suggested by the official "press<br>
releases" by the gcc2 and egcs teams, is that egcs' rapid acceptance<br>
of submitted patches and willingness to try out "experimental"<br>
features will make it more buggy.<br>
<p>
Only time, and a voracious appetite on the part of the gcc/egcs<br>
user base, will tell for sure.  Certainly if egcs has more bugs<br>
per release, that might be a problem.  However, if it has, on<br>
average, 5 times as many bugs, but bug-fix patches are accepted<br>
10 times as fast, on the whole, this might appear to users<br>
(especially of more "stable" systems that are less affected<br>
by the "experimental" features) as if egcs is less buggy overall.<br>
<p>
(Note that some of these "experimental" features were years old<br>
and already well-proven in the field, however.  Most of what<br>
is truly "experimental" about egcs is the development *process*<br>
and packaging, I think, not the code and algorithms being accepted<br>
for submission.)<br>
<p>
It is certainly an interesting, and somewhat challenging, time<br>
for gcc developers and users, but I do think there will be more<br>
clarity and hope by mid-1998 than there was in mid-1997.  That<br>
is just a prediction on my part, however.<br>
