<i>&gt; This is exactly why Digital applauded when AMD said that they would make thei</i><br>
r<br>
<i>&gt; K7 use the same motherboards as Alpha.  This meant that there would not just</i><br>
<i>&gt; be a market for 10,000 Alpha boards, but 10,000,000 (some with Alpha and some</i><br>
<i>&gt; with K7s).  And (more importantly to our OEMS and to you, our end customers)</i><br>
<i>&gt; Digital could not supply all of those 10,000,000, so there would develop a</i><br>
<i>&gt; competative market for different board designs that met different needs.  And</i><br>
<i>&gt; prices would drop, perhaps to the same price as a "PC" motherboard.  Which</i><br>
<i>&gt; makes our OEM systems cheaper, which means more Alphas are sold.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Incideous, isn't it?  Selling more Alphas by selling more K7s, and from</i><br>
<i>&gt; a company that sold its FAB to Intel.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
*That* is frankly more interesting than all the other issues.<br>
<p>
"Blah, blah, blah, economies of scale..."<br>
<p>
"Deal with AMD..."<br>
<p>
Hmmm...<br>
<p>
It's not clear from AMD's web site just what the relationship between the K7<br>
and the Alpha EV-6; it would *appear* that Digital sold some technology to<br>
AMD relating to "bus protocols."  Which is an absolutely *fascinating*<br>
idea, as it allows AMD to "eat into" Intel.  <br>
<p>
It's not 100% clear; this might very well be Digital using the "fruits" of<br>
the lawsuit settlement to indirectly injure Intel by reselling what they got<br>
from Intel to AMD.  That's speculative on my part, and could very well be<br>
entirely incorrect; it is just as likely that Digital is using their<br>
ownership of the technologies that they themselves developed, and is, in<br>
effect, selling weapons to *two* sets of "enemies."  In any case, hopefully<br>
this makes Digital some money and causes consternation at Intel...<br>
<p>
It would be most gratifying for there to become some *real* cheap Alpha<br>
motherboards come out of the dealings.  And even more wonderful if some<br>
joint ventures between AMD and Digital turned into a more "open" SMP<br>
standard thus making both AMD K7 SMP systems available and cheap, as well as<br>
the same for Digital Alpha SMP systems.  And that completes the circle;<br>
*Compaq* might also find these sorts of combinations attractive...<br>
