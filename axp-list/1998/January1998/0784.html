O.K.<br>
<p>
Partially to answer Keith Baker's rant against Compaq, and partially to keep<br>
you up-to-date with what is going on.....<br>
<p>
Digital is to be a wholly owned subsidiary of Compaq.  We will continue to<br>
make Alpha chips, boards and systems.  What will happen in the Intel PC space<br>
is unknown.....but you would not be on this list if you were too concerned<br>
about the Intel PC space....<br>
<p>
One of the benefits to Compaq (according to this VP) is that they get good<br>
engineers in a campus fairly close to Boston.  According to this VP, Compaq<br>
has a difficult time attracting the number of engineers they need to Houston,<br>
Texas, and they had been considering opening up an east-coast engineering<br>
group.  This is not surprising.  Sun and (until recently) HP also have<br>
campuses here.  Between all of this (and the fact that both Digital and<br>
Compaq are actively hiring engineers) we do not expect any lay-offs of<br>
Alpha engineering personel.<br>
<p>
Nor do we anticipate any layoffs of support people.  In fact, we have a long<br>
standing arrangement with Compaq previous to this to supply support to<br>
Compaq's customers.  This just became easier, and I anticipate that we will<br>
be hiring even more support people, both Intel and Alpha.<br>
<p>
Finally, to answer Keith's question about how Compaq lowers prices, I will<br>
clarify that prices of computers drop dramatically when they get to high<br>
volume of manufacture for several reasons:<br>
<p>
	o you can set up high volume lines to produce components and systems<br>
	o you can order parts in much larger quantities<br>
<p>
Manufacturing lines are set up to produce certain things.  Ideally what you<br>
want to do is to set up a line to produce *exactly* the right amount of<br>
widgets for *exactly* the life of the product.  No inventory anywhere,<br>
just-in-time delivery of everything.  Now that we have all had a laugh.....<br>
...because while it is good in theory, it hardly ever happens, and it is<br>
more difficult for smaller lines and lower volumes.<br>
<p>
The real truth is that you get as close as you can, BUT in a lot of ways<br>
the larger the line, and the more you can produce on it in its life, the<br>
more you make up for the tooling costs, and hold in-bound inventory in<br>
check.  Ergo, manufacturing in larger numbers almost always helps.  Now,<br>
if you can spread those widgets manufactured over two or more products, you<br>
can even out your deliveries (taking into account lulls in sales performance),<br>
and extend the life of the line.<br>
<p>
So, "ramping up" for a large run helps.  Compared to what Compaq does in<br>
any part of its manufacturing, Digital has small runs.<br>
<p>
Now for the purchasing part:<br>
<p>
Memory chips (for example) are memory chips.  Only certain companies make them.<br>
But when a company that sells 1000 systems a month, each with 32 Meg in them<br>
tries to compete with a company that sells 100,000 systems a month with 32 Meg<br>
in them, guess who the memory company gives the better discount to?  The<br>
better delivery dates (remember the "just in time" deliveries?)<br>
<p>
Now hold that concept and apply it to disk drives, capacitors, resistors,<br>
video displays, cables (ahhh, cables...talk about expense...) and we have not<br>
even talked about the concept of design yet.  And a lot of what Keith did not<br>
like was the design, not the components.<br>
<p>
This is exactly why Digital applauded when AMD said that they would make their<br>
K7 use the same motherboards as Alpha.  This meant that there would not just<br>
be a market for 10,000 Alpha boards, but 10,000,000 (some with Alpha and some<br>
with K7s).  And (more importantly to our OEMS and to you, our end customers)<br>
Digital could not supply all of those 10,000,000, so there would develop a<br>
competative market for different board designs that met different needs.  And<br>
prices would drop, perhaps to the same price as a "PC" motherboard.  Which<br>
makes our OEM systems cheaper, which means more Alphas are sold.<br>
<p>
Incideous, isn't it?  Selling more Alphas by selling more K7s, and from<br>
a company that sold its FAB to Intel.<br>
<p>
And don't get me wrong.....Compaq benefits from the increased volume of<br>
Digital's market as we benfit from the increased volumes of their market.<br>
<p>
Compaq has sold to a particular market in the past.  While you may not like<br>
the fact that they built in a lot of the functionality onto the motherboard<br>
so it could not be upgraded easily, this fit a certain portion of their<br>
market. I do not believe that it is the market they wish to penetrate with<br>
Digital's engineering and products, ergo you will probably see a different<br>
style of engineering from the Alpha line.<br>
<p>
As always, these are my observations (with a little input from the VP)<br>
Actual reality may vary.<br>
<p>
With this, it is late, and I hear a pizza calling me, and perhaps a beer<br>
or two.  Let's let the dust settle a little more.<br>
<p>
And now, back to technical discussions.<br>
