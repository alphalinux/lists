<p>
It is and has always been my opinion that McAffee sucks, sorry.  I would<br>
never use that software again.  But do remember that their paranoia is<br>
primarily just that: Parinoia.  The most effective method of averting a<br>
virus infestation is education.  Do not load software downlaoded from a<br>
BBS.  Only FTP software from trusted sites (eg, a vendor).  Disable the<br>
"Boot from Drive A:" feature.  And read the page about virus hoaxes (eg,<br>
"Good Times", etc).  Don't execute code that performs an n-th level binary<br>
loop and burns up your cpu (yea, whatever...)<br>
<p>
Today, there are really only two significant virus threats.  One is false<br>
virus threats that create panic (don't read this email or it'll erase your<br>
hard drive!); the other is Micro$oft Word macro viruses.  These are the<br>
most common and most insidious viruses today.  Actually, the first threat<br>
can be real.  Many MS programs use MS Word as an email reader (overkill?)<br>
and these people will be vulnerable.  I think right now the best option is<br>
to use Netscape to read mail, and get a virus scanner that is also a<br>
Netscape plugin.  That will protect you not only from malevolant ActiveX<br>
controls, but also email bourne virii.<br>
<p>
Names that I liked in the past (I've also been OS/2 and Linux for several<br>
years now, so these may be dated) are F-Prot, ThunderByte, and Dr. <br>
Solomon.  At least one of these has a Netscape plugin version. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Thanks,</i><br>
<p>
Hope it was useful<br>
