<i>&gt; Hey, who ever said a naming scheme had to make sense? I never implied that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the name "XL" made it obvious it would only run NT, did I? The internal name</i><br>
<p>
Is that what it means?  Given that "XL" sounds so similar to "excel", it<br>
would seem a very inappropriate name.  :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; something you're interested in, it's just noise. I can guarantee that since</i><br>
<i>&gt; the start of December, I've handled XL-related questions a dozen times, with</i><br>
<i>&gt; this specific subjhect at least twice.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Pay attention... :-) :-) :-)</i><br>
<p>
I probly ought to.  :)  Guess I just kinda figured that XL was a MoBo type<br>
like LX or SX and thought it was an "unsupported hardware" issue, more<br>
like my Sun 3/330 rather than an "NT-only" issue. <br>
<p>
See, I'm learning.  :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There's some reasonable treatises on MILO to be found at:</i><br>
<i>&gt;   gatekeeper.dec.com:/pub/DEC/LInux-Alpha/Miniloader/docs</i><br>
<p>
&lt;sigh&gt;.  I may peruse them.  At this point, our AXP runs Linux happily<br>
(though I tried my damndest to get it to auto-boot without a FAT<br>
partition) and I'm mostly content.  Still got that video problem (the<br>
monitor went into power-savee mode and won't exit), but it's a headless<br>
beast until our development shifts gears...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Are you saying that it (in PeeCee speek) is essentially a BIOS?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, well, sort of; best idea would be to read the PALcode section(s) of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Alpha Architecture reference Manual, available at:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; <a href="http://ftp.digital.com/pub/Digital/info/semiconductor/literature/dsc-library.html">http://ftp.digital.com/pub/Digital/info/semiconductor/literature/dsc-library.html</a></i><br>
<p>
ack!  :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I always (and still) find it rather annoying that the hardware needs to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; probed three times just to boot ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Don't PCs get probed twice? The third time is just a side-effect of using</i><br>
<i>&gt; MILO to replace the ARC/Alphabios console. If you boot directly from SRM,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or happen to FLASH MILO to replace the console, it's only twice...</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I suppose you're correct.  I'm just not used to the rather long SCSI<br>
detect delay, and MILO's default 30 timeout.  Makes me wary to want to try<br>
to remote reboot such a machine ... (for no good reason, I'm sure).<br>
<p>
Can I blast MILO into the firmware on an old UDB?  I remember reading<br>
there was a jumper to do so, but I found it rather perilous for a newbee<br>
to try.  If I did, could I get rid of the FAT parition?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; According to the report, it is doing this "at a time</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when it is struggling to grow Alpha product revenue."</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Uh, when have we *not* been struggling? ;-}</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; True.  But the question, I think, remains valid.  :)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then what *was* the real question? DEC is large enough so that different</i><br>
<i>&gt; parts think of different strategies to make money; you're seeing just one</i><br>
<i>&gt; part's ideas there...</i><br>
<p>
It's in the subject.  :)<br>
<p>
I still don't see, though, how alienating non-NT users increases revenue.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Unless you are saying that you can boot Linux from a machine apparently</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; engineered to boot nothing but NT, I'm merely saying that these price cuts</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; are trivial/worthless for whatever intention I might have had for buying</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; one, as I have no desire whatsoever to run NT on Alpha.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually, to this point, there's never *been* a DEC machine or mobo designed</i><br>
<i>&gt; for which it was *planned* that it boot LINUX... ;-}</i><br>
<p>
Well ... neither has there been such a PC, but most PCs are not *designed*<br>
to boot only DOS/Windows.  Is it that difficult to have a generic boot? <br>
<p>
gotta run,<br>
