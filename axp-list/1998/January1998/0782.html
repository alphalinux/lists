<p>
As a Alpha user at home, I'm not.  As a business user of Digital Intel PCs,<br>
I hope they do not mess with the service division.  I have had a real good<br>
experience with service group and our 60 odd PCs over the last three years.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;One of the benefits to Compaq (according to this VP) is that they get good</i><br>
<i>&gt;engineers in a campus fairly close to Boston.  According to this VP, Compaq</i><br>
<i>&gt;has a difficult time attracting the number of engineers they need to Houston,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Texas, and they had been considering opening up an east-coast engineering</i><br>
<i>&gt;group.  This is not surprising.  Sun and (until recently) HP also have</i><br>
<i>&gt;campuses here.  Between all of this (and the fact that both Digital and</i><br>
<i>&gt;Compaq are actively hiring engineers) we do not expect any lay-offs of</i><br>
<i>&gt;Alpha engineering personel.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Nor do we anticipate any layoffs of support people.  In fact, we have a long</i><br>
<i>&gt;standing arrangement with Compaq previous to this to supply support to</i><br>
<i>&gt;Compaq's customers.  This just became easier, and I anticipate that we will</i><br>
<i>&gt;be hiring even more support people, both Intel and Alpha.</i><br>
<p>
Both good to hear.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Manufacturing lines are set up to produce certain things.  Ideally what you</i><br>
<i>&gt;want to do is to set up a line to produce *exactly* the right amount of</i><br>
<i>&gt;widgets for *exactly* the life of the product.  No inventory anywhere,</i><br>
<i>&gt;just-in-time delivery of everything.  Now that we have all had a laugh.....</i><br>
<i>&gt;...because while it is good in theory, it hardly ever happens, and it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;more difficult for smaller lines and lower volumes.</i><br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;So, "ramping up" for a large run helps.  Compared to what Compaq does in</i><br>
<i>&gt;any part of its manufacturing, Digital has small runs.</i><br>
<p>
This one baffles me...If Compaq wanted Digital for manufacturing, why oh<br>
why did they not say something before the FABs were agreed to be sold to<br>
Intel???  Unless (donning tin foil lined hat to protect me from THEM)  all<br>
along it's been a three-way deal between Digital, Intel and Compaq.  Intel<br>
you get the fabs to make Compaq more chips and Digital you keep the<br>
maintenance part to work on the computers made by Compaq with the chips<br>
from Intel.  Hopefully, thiose computers are Alpha based!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; While you may not like</i><br>
<i>&gt;the fact that they built in a lot of the functionality onto the motherboard</i><br>
<i>&gt;so it could not be upgraded easily, this fit a certain portion of their</i><br>
<i>&gt;market. I do not believe that it is the market they wish to penetrate with</i><br>
<i>&gt;Digital's engineering and products, ergo you will probably see a different</i><br>
<i>&gt;style of engineering from the Alpha line.</i><br>
<p>
While we're touching this subject, could someone let the designers of the<br>
LX system know that it'd be nice to have a way to disable the IDE ports on<br>
the board.  I'd like two of my IRQs back please... (I had to get something<br>
technical in this post. ;-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Incideous, isn't it?  Selling more Alphas by selling more K7s, and from</i><br>
<i>&gt;a company that sold its FAB to Intel.</i><br>
<p>
I do hope this catches on.  The slot upgradeable Deskstation and Panda<br>
boxes have always looked intriguing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As always, these are my observations (with a little input from the VP)</i><br>
<i>&gt;Actual reality may vary.</i><br>
<p>
Thanks, it remains to be seen!<br>
