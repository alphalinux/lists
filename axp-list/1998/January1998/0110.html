<i>&gt;Interesting point.  Obviously the shoes were not yours and therefore </i><br>
<i>&gt;stolen.  However, there is a legal principal pertaining to intellectual </i><br>
<i>&gt;property, and that is, that if you do not act to protect your rights you </i><br>
<i>&gt;essentially abdicate them, meaning that it becomes public domain.  Thus </i><br>
<i>&gt;you get a free license.</i><br>
<p>
Uh, care to *identify* that legal principal?  Or is it one you<br>
just made up?  Then again, please don't, not here, because<br>
this thread is *completely* irrelevant to Alpha/Linux issues.<br>
<p>
I suggest this thread end here, and anyone who actually wants to<br>
know the *facts* can go read the Copyright FAQ, or go to one of<br>
them old-fangled buildings called a "library", find a few books<br>
on copyright law, and read them.  Make sure you read sufficiently<br>
recent information -- if it doesn't mention changes to the US<br>
copyright laws since 1970 or so ("Berne Convention" is one phrase<br>
that comes to mind), it's probably too old.<br>
<p>
IANAL, but as far as I know, the only "intellectual-property"<br>
law that approximates the idea that "if you don't act to protect<br>
your rights [...your property] becomes public domain" is the law<br>
that pertain to *trademarks*.  Not copyright.  Nor patents, for<br>
that matter.  And even with trademarks, "public domain" is a<br>
very short-lived status.  (Ask the Linux people about the trademark<br>
status and history of the name "Linux" for just one example.)<br>
<p>
But *please* don't argue this out here.  I'm posting *only* to<br>
provide a counter to gratuitous misinformation.  If you want to<br>
argue about it, first *read* something definitive on the topic,<br>
as I've done.  Then, consult a qualified intellectual-property<br>
*lawyer* to find out whether your theories about how the law<br>
works are even close to the truth.  After all that work, I hope<br>
you'll know enough to refrain from posting misinformation, and<br>
have sufficient appreciation for the availability of the online<br>
materials (Copyright FAQ) and proper forum (*not* axp-list) such<br>
that you'll point people to those and take any arguments you have<br>
up with *them*, not *us*.<br>
