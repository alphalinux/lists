That's mostly true with trademark. It's quite definitely not true with<br>
copyright, including copyright of software.<br>
<p>
If I might quote my own Copyright FAQ<br>
(&lt;<a href="http://www.aimnet.com/~carroll/copyright/faq-home.html">http://www.aimnet.com/~carroll/copyright/faq-home.html</a>):<br>
<p>
 There is a common belief that if someone infringes a copyright, and the<br>
 copyright owner does not sue or otherwise put a stop to the infringement,<br>
 the copyright is lost and the work goes into the public domain.  There is<br>
 some pre-1988 law on this (e.g., Stuff v. E.C. Publications, 432 F.2d 143<br>
 (2d Cir., 1965) and Transgo v. Ajac Transmission Parts, 768 F.2d 1001<br>
 (9th Cir. 1985)), but it seems to derive mostly from the fact that the<br>
 copyright holder had acquiesced in the publication of the work without<br>
 notice back when notice was a requirement.  It was the publication<br>
 without notice, and not the lack of enforcement, that actually worked to<br>
 put the work in the public domain.  This is forfeiture of copyright, not<br>
 abandonment.  Because the notice requirement is now gone from copyright<br>
 law, these cases don't have much weight today.<br>
<p>
 I can't find anything that supports the idea that failure to assert a<br>
 copyright against an infringer can alone lead to placing the work in the<br>
 public domain (if you have any authoritative information on this, please<br>
 drop me a note at one of the addresses listed in the introduction).  Of<br>
 course, circumstances may be such that the ability to sue a particular<br>
 infringer might be waived (e.g., a statute of limitations may expire (see<br>
 section 3.4), or if the infringer has reasonably relied to his or her<br>
 detriment on the copyright holder's failure to sue, the doctrine of<br>
 laches may bar a suit), but that's only with respect to that particular<br>
 infringer, and does not affect the status of the copyright with respect<br>
 to others<br>
