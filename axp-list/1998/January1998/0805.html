About the big-series/lower-prices issue...<br>
<p>
Ahhh, so this explains why Compaq, DEC, IBM, Intel and all the other big <br>
companies are so cheap (not!) compared to smaller ones. Thanks for that<br>
clarification...<br>
<p>
...meaning that it might also be that bigger companies equals slower <br>
companies and huge bureaucratic overhead and tens of thousands engineers <br>
sitting in small cubicles having no idea what they are supposed to do<br>
while hoards of office-workers carry around million tons of paper <br>
stating this weeks policies on how to be a happy cubicle, and the <br>
greyhaired yuppies in the boardroom make their big plans to get bigger<br>
and better, and a decade or two later has to lay-off 50000 people<br>
just to survive next year, because the big company made big and expensive<br>
and outdated and slow products and people buying the stuff don't care if <br>
it's a big company with high volume lines, as they can get better stuff <br>
cheaper from that new, small and nimble company where the guys in the <br>
boardroom actually care about the company and it's products and are <br>
less worried about how big a fortune they'll have when they are sixty...<br>
<p>
...meaning that we don't know what will happen, really, and in the<br>
end both the big and the small company and all the yuppies inbetween<br>
will be dust, and in another part of the galaxy a small protein will crawl<br>
out of the mud thinking that if it joins up with that sexy-looking<br>
protein in the next mudhole it will be even bigger and better...<br>
<p>
...meaning that I probably should sleep more and I really must read<br>
Asimovs Foundation again...<br>
