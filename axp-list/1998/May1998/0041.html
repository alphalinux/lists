<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; They will, but I seriously suggest considering planning for a better SCSI</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; controller in the long run. Narrow, non-ultra disks are 8 times slower than</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; state-of-the-art Ultra-2 products.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; If what you plan to do is VERY non-disk-intensive, then fine.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;That's a bit harsh. Unless you're into RAID and use 10K RPM disks,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the 2940 will work reasonably well. Notice they are trying to minimize</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;costs of switching to Alpha. That probably means the disks aren't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;high end. For most people, myself included, a narrow SCSI is sufficient</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;for most desktop work. Not all, of course. I use mostly wides for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;SCSI but I run one Alpha with two narrow cards in it and it works</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;well, no complaints and a PPro with a single narrow SCSI and it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;too does a reasonable job. Depending on your disks, you get from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;4-7MB/second. If you need a server, then go with a better SCSI</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;card, preferably UW. How many folks out there have U2W cards</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and have them working?? I've been thinking about getting one</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;since it allows longer cabling.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; As long as they don't go and buy a narrow disk to "upgrade" it. This would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be then trapping them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Simply put, I think the only reason for buying an Alpha and running Linux</i><br>
<i>&gt; on it is for speed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; If you then choke it with slow peripherals, exactly what is the point?</i><br>
<p>
 Bottle necks are relative. What applications are you running on your<br>
desktop that need more than 7MB/sec? The average UW disk is<br>
only good for around 8MB/sec. So, you only lose a MB/sec.<br>
I've used IBM/Quantum/Micropolis/WD/Seagate drives and only<br>
the very latest HH 9GB and higher drives seriously exceed the speed<br>
of a 2940. Servers are a different story. I use multi-GB files and<br>
can easily live with 7MB/sec. Last one I messed with was 12GB<br>
and if you do the math, it only takes half an hour to read it in at<br>
7MB/sec. Assuming you do FP calculations on that data, it's not<br>
hard to come up with half an hour of computation. Course what I<br>
do actually combines the data into a much smaller output volume.<br>
But, even so, I doubt many people are screwing with large files,<br>
particularly since it's only been supported since about 2.1.92 so<br>
all you're looking at for most folks is 2GB, tops which is about<br>
5 minutes to read, and another 5 minutes to write.<br>
<p>
As to whether Alpha is a desktop box. If that's not what DEC intended<br>
for the 164SX, it would truly surprise me. If you've listened to this<br>
mailing list, there is a strong interest in office suites and browsers.<br>
I too would like both to be available. As it is, using em86 is an option,<br>
but it sounds like serious performance degradation. Now you have<br>
to say THAT is a CPU bottleneck.... even on an Alpha.<br>
<p>
My $.02.<br>
