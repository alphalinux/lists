Hi!<br>
<p>
I have earlier explained my intentions to write a IDE DMA driver for the<br>
Cypress chipset in the SX164. Now, my time is extremely limited, so this<br>
is not happening as fast as I would like it to. If anyone has some time<br>
over and is interrested in helping me with the driver, write me a line.<br>
<p>
Anyway, the IDE driver is working quite fine and the fastest IDE disk I<br>
have measured tops out at about 7.5MB/s using 13% cpu which seems quite<br>
alright for standard eide to me.<br>
<p>
The reason I haven't released the driver is that I have a serious problem.<br>
When I use the DMA driver it hogs the PCI bus during the DMA transfer.<br>
Normally, all PCI devices of this kind has a limitation for how long each<br>
transfer can be, called latency. For example, my NCR 875 SCSI card has a<br>
latency of 32. Unfortunately, the Cypress chipset reports that it doesn't<br>
want a latency at all, implicating that unlimited PCI transfers may be<br>
done. This is probably very good for getting maximum speed on the<br>
interface, but other devices which wants to use the PCI bus simply has to<br>
wait. In my case, the soundcard doesn't have enough buffer to accept this<br>
delay, and the music is affected. If I transfer data with dd using 64k<br>
blocksize the music really sounds bad.<br>
<p>
Another thing the happends is that while playing (distorted) music through<br>
my soundcard and transferring data from the IDE drive using the DMA<br>
driver, the transfer speed slows down to about half. This doesn't occur<br>
with SCSI either. I haven't figured out the reason for this yet. Anyone?<br>
<p>
At first I tried to set the PCI parameter for latency in the Cypress<br>
device to a more resonable value, but this unfortunately had no effect<br>
what so ever. It seems that the Cypress device is hardwired to inifinite<br>
latency. Great!   I looked this up in the PCI specifications, and it<br>
actually accepts hardwired latencys.<br>
<p>
Ok, when this failed I seemed to remeber that there was another way to<br>
limit the maximum transfer using the PCI controller. This proved to be<br>
correct, I can set the hard latency limit using the PYXIS_MAX_LAT<br>
variable. I tried to set this to 64 and this made the problem be less<br>
evident, but still not ok. I think it would go away if I simply lower the<br>
value enough. But unfortunately this had a serious side effect. The X<br>
server locks up with incredible frequency. The machine totally stops and a<br>
hard reset is required. I have a Matrox Millennium.<br>
<p>
Now I can't think of any other way to fix this problem except rebuilding<br>
the transfers to be small enough. This will lead to less efficient<br>
transfers, more interrupts and more cpu usage. Is there any other way I<br>
can solve the problem?<br>
<p>
