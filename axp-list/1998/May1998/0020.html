Must have something in your kernel config wrong. I always turn on <br>
experimental stuff and use it if it relates to my HW config. I haven't<br>
seen a SCSI disk slower than 4MB/sec for two years, and have had<br>
Adaptecs<br>
running under Linux for 3-4 years. Only in the past year have I<br>
seriously<br>
used Linux. My fastest UW drive is a 1" high WD 9GB. Peaks at 12.5<br>
MB/sec<br>
and averages 10MB/sec ++. Damn fast. I expect the HH 18GB drives are<br>
a similar speed w/7200RPM. And for those with money to blow, the 10K<br>
RPMs<br>
must really fly. I've seen manufacturer info stating they guarantee<br>
15MB/sec on them. Too expensive for me to justify though and I own<br>
my company!!<br>

<i>&gt; As for office software, it will happen IF there are enough users.</i><br>

YUP. A chicken/egg thing. Who spends time on a product no one<br>
wants to buy. Wish those folks would listen to this mailing list.<br>
Not porting to Alpha Linux now will hurt them later when Merced<br>
happens. Working out 64 bit bugs sooner than later.... I think I'll<br>
have a good laugh when NT goes 64bit and the Wintel folks have to<br>
clean up their act.... (also the Intel Linux folks but they will<br>
already have a substantial portion of their work done for them<br>
by the Alpha Linux crowd. Wonder if they'll say thank you??)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   Secondly there would need to be a solid (stock) distribution of Linux for</i><br>
<i>&gt; it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; As this does not now exist, I can only hope for big improvements in Red Hat</i><br>
<i>&gt; 5.1 and other supposedly imminent releases of Alpha Linux.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
RH5.0 is tolerably stable. Most problems are corrected with errata. The<br>
big problem is past history. Since previous releases used the old C<br>
library, all those binary RPM's are problems waiting to happen.<br>
<p>
Debian is close. I've been listening to their alpha mailing list. Not<br>
nearly as many people interested in Debian as RH though. Probably due<br>
to the fact they haven't been able to cut a CD yet. So, they don't<br>
have the history problem with their version and should have less <br>
issues when they do release. My bet is soon, maybe 30 days. They<br>
froze their tree just a bit ago and the Alpha guys are trying to<br>
keep up with the Intel folks but most of the Debian Alpha maintainers<br>
seem to have slow machines. Anyone got the $$ to get them a better<br>
development system so they can keep up??<br>
