<p>
All of this stuff is beyond the scope of RH's installation support,<br>
anyhow.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2. I just ordered a 56K PCMCIA modem for my multia (that has two PCMCIA</i><br>
<i>&gt; slots).  Can you tell me step-by-step instructions for setting it up</i><br>
<i>&gt; so I can dial my ISP and do TCP/IP? How do I make /dev/modem be alive?</i><br>
<i>&gt; How do I tell it to dial out on /dev/modem to establish PPP with</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ISP that I have been dialing from my Win95 system (via PPP)</i><br>
<p>
I'm not familiar w/ PCMCIA devices (might be a HOWTO somewhere for<br>
this..), but I am familiar with using regular modems to establish PPP<br>
connections. You can take the easy way out and use netcfg to configure<br>
a PPP link, or you do the "right" thing and read the PPP HOWTO (one of<br>
the best) and configure the scripts manually.<br>
<p>
netcfg will likely work faster, doing it manually will be a good<br>
experience for a newbie.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3. The console clock on my Multia won't let me save the correct date.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It forces it to the year 2018 - and then when my system boots, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; system time on machine is always off by a couple of decades.</i><br>
<p>
2 decades exactely, right? You need to tell Linux that you're using<br>
ARC, by using timeconfig.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 4. My X-server runs, but the screen size seems to be wrong - it thinks</i><br>
<i>&gt; the screen is bigger than it really is, resulting in windows that hang</i><br>
<i>&gt; off the edge. Any idea what I did wrong or how to fix it?</i><br>
<p>
This is a "feature" known as a virtual screen. The easiest way to ditch<br>
it is to open /etc/X11/XF86Config in your fav. text editor (pico is the<br>
simplest to use for basic newbie editing), and find a line that looks<br>
like:<br>
<p>
	Virtual		1024 768<br>
<p>
and change it to:<br>
<p>
	Virtual		0 0<br>
<p>
There's more than one of these lines, and the numbers may be different.<br>
You specifically want the Virtual line under the<br>
<p>
Section "Screen"<br>
	Driver "accel"<br>
<p>
section.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 5. I'm hoping to setup my Alpha as a gateway for my LAN to connect to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the real world (via dialin to my ISP) - Any suggestions on how to</i><br>
<i>&gt; get it right? Can I setup my alpha as a DNS server for the other machines </i><br>
<i>&gt; on my LAN?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, you can setup your box as a DNS. You'll want to read the DNS<br>
HOWTO, which is living in /usr/doc/ldp somewhere, as well as at<br>
<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/">http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/</a><br>
<p>
If you only have one IP number from your ISP, you'll need to use IP<br>
Masquerading to allow all of your boxes to access the Internet. There's<br>
a mini-HOWTO on this topic, as well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 6. I'm a bit nervous about upgrading to RedHat 5.0 - should I be? or</i><br>
<i>&gt; might it make things easier rather than harder? My concern is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the reliability of the newer software - it is probably better than</i><br>
<i>&gt; 4.2. My concern is that my system works now, and "if it ain't broke,</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't fix it".</i><br>
<p>
Which is the correct mentality. Now, when 5.1 or 5.2 comes out, you<br>
might want to consider upgrading, as most of the bugs will have likely<br>
been ironed out. However, I wouldn't recommend jumping up to 5.0 just<br>
for the hell of it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm really looking forward to getting my alpha on the net so I can get</i><br>
<i>&gt; updates by downloading -- that'll be so cool. I'll also be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; have a web server going. Big changes about to happen here... I hope.</i><br>
<p>
You already have Apache installed, and it's not difficult to configure<br>
:)<br>
<p>
BTW, a lot of this isn't exactely Alpha-specific, and could be asked on<br>
redhat-list or redhat-ppp-list.<br>
