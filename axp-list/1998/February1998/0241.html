Christian,<br>
<p>
I have not had the pleasure to set up diskless workstations. :)<br>
However, using my knowledge of NFS and sysadmin here's my crack at<br>
the problem. FWIW<br>
<p>
First you need to set up a directory for each diskless workstation and<br>
export this as read,write for only that workstation.  Next, the workstation<br>
will need to mount this as it's root directory structure.  You can not use<br>
the servers root for your workstations.  Your workstations will have<br>
different devices and configuration files, all of which is controled in the<br>
root directory structure.  If you tried to use your servers directory<br>
structure they would all have the same configuration files, which for<br>
example would make them think they all have the same hostname and ip<br>
address.  You could potentially set them all up to have the same /usr<br>
directory, although this would depend on how you set up applications.<br>
<p>
Hope this helps.<br>

An idea I'd like to implement... please tell me if I'm off course (or<br>
there's a better way).<br>
<p>
I'm trying to boot diskless alpha/linux nodes.<br>
<p>
It looks like vmlinux is already setup (given it's configured for an<br>
NFS root) to mount the root partition across the network.  My tests<br>
actually failed, but I think that was because the bootp server was<br>
running DUX... and the /dev part of the file system didn't sit well on<br>
DUX.  Anyway, it seems to correctly negotiate with the bootp server<br>
and mount an NFS root before failure.<br>
<p>
So, if I could get milo, vmlinux, and some bios/console all into<br>
NVRAM, then this might work.<br>
<p>
But, I was looking at DEC's debug monitor, and it looks like it will<br>
netboot too!  It seems limited to the DEC 21040 (tulip) and am79c960<br>
NIC cards, but if that's not a problem, then it should be able to<br>
retrieve milo &amp; vmlinux to boot.<br>
<p>
I have had success booting milo/vmlinux from the debug monitor,<br>
although I've been told to only boot milo from the ARC console (that's<br>
all DEC is supporting).  This might be a problem for the future of<br>
this idea.<br>
<p>
I'd change the debug monitor so that it would timeout if no user<br>
characters were entered, and go directly to trying to boot from the<br>
net.<br>
<p>
It would need to retrieve a file into memory that had both milo &amp;<br>
vmlinux images combined, then boot milo.<br>
<p>
I'd change milo to find vmlinux in memory, then unzip the memory copy<br>
of vmlinux, and boot it.<br>
<p>
Any better way to do this?  Any "gotcha's" you can think of?<br>
<p>
