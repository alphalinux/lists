Jeff,<br>
<p>
I'm new to the DEC Multia and certainly no authority, but this is what the<br>
folks at Starship tell me regarding heat. If you have one of those tiny 2.5<br>
inch HDs that fit under the floppy drive you are probably OK heat-wise, but<br>
they advise against installing a 3.5 inch HD in the Multia box (talking DEC<br>
Alpha Multia 166 MHz VX40 boxes here) contrary to what DEC shows in their<br>
"Multia MultiClient Desktop Service Information" (Part Number: EK-MULTS-IN.<br>
C01, October 1995), which you can download at<br>
<a href="http://www.starshipcorp.com/udbman.pdf">http://www.starshipcorp.com/udbman.pdf</a>.<br>
<p>
<p>
According to Starship, "the Alpha chip runs very hot in normal<br>
applications. There is only a small fan cooling the chip, and any normal<br>
3.5" [hard disk] drive will add far more heat in the box than a 2.5" drive<br>
will. The hotter the Alpha chip cooks, the slower it runs and the shorter<br>
it lives." [This (and the following quote), from the Starship Coupon Book,<br>
p 4-1.]<br>
<p>
They add, "there is only a 75 Watt power supply in the machine. The Alpha<br>
chip alone takes about half of that power, leaving very7 little for the<br>
floppy disk and the rest of the board, much less powering a juice hungry<br>
3.5" [hard drive]. And if drives are run on less power than they need, the<br>
tend to start malfunctioning."<br>
<p>
They conclude the, because (1) the 340 MB 2.5" HD is too small for a full<br>
load of RH (and also more expensive than a larger 3.5" drive -- i.e.,<br>
Starship will be happy to sell you either) and (2) you need a SCSI CDROM to<br>
install RH 5.0, you should consider an external drive box. A two bay box<br>
will give you room for a HD and a CDROM.<br>
<p>
I bought a brand new (empty) DEC 4-bay case w/200 W power supply (holds<br>
3.5" or 5.25" half heights) units that Starship sells. They also sell SCSI<br>
cables with the special sub miniature 50-pin connector you need to attach<br>
external SCSI devices to a Multia. The DEC drive box uses standard 50-pin<br>
Centronics connectors.<br>
<p>
One way around the connector problem (assuming you aren't going to install<br>
a card in the single PCI bus slot) would be to find a slot cover with<br>
50-pin Centronix and ribbon cable to standard internal 50 pin connector,<br>
install it in place of the slot cover, unplug the ribbon cable going to the<br>
sub mini connector and plug your new cable in its place.<br>
<p>
If you stuck with this ramble, here's THE IMPORTANT INFORMATION. Assuming<br>
you follow Starship's advice and use EXTERNAL SCSI devices, you should be<br>
able to run you Multia around the clock. There is another important<br>
consideration, however. Any Unix system that is supposed to be doing useful<br>
unattended task in the wee hours ought to be protected by being run off of<br>
a UPS (Uninterruptable Power Supply.)<br>
<p>
APS sell adequate units for under $100 at the local computer super store of<br>
your choice. The thing to remember is that the UPS has a relatively short<br>
(~20 minute) hold up time. It's real purpose is to keep your system (box<br>
and bay, forget the monitor) up long enough for a gracefull shutdown. APS<br>
units have a (?) DB-15 connector on the back that lets you cable to a<br>
serial port on the Multia and notify Unix that the power is down. Although<br>
APS software (most intended for MAC and WinTel machines) probably won't<br>
help you, there are all kinds of daemons available for the free Un*x's that<br>
can not only gracefully shutdown your Multia but also can alert other<br>
machines on a LAN, even dial a beeper to wake you up. A little too much for<br>
me, but then I am just teaching myself Unix by playing with different<br>
flavors of it (NetBSD Alpha, RedHat 5.0, and -- when I can get it --<br>
FreeBSD) on my three Multia boxes. All three incidently use drives in an<br>
external DEC 4-bay box.<br>
<p>
Hope this helps...<br>

<i>&gt;I keep getting this on my Multia Alpha in RedHat 5.0.  Does anyone have</i><br>
<i>&gt;any idea what this means?:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&lt;SC 347(0,0,0)&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I get these 10-20 times on each boot-up.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Another problem I have is that sometimes I can't boot up.  when I have</i><br>
<i>&gt;the system autoboot from MILO it eventually gets to: kernel panic can't</i><br>
<i>&gt;read device 08:02 on the final mounting.  The kernel temporarily mounted</i><br>
<i>&gt;the partition before.  The startup used to work OK.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Also, for a Multia, is leaving the computer on overnight a bad idea?  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;understand that the thing gets pretty hot, and I wonder if my memory</i><br>
<i>&gt;problems stem from the heat.</i><br>
