Here's an odd one or two:<br>
<p>
  While installing RH5.0 on my recently acquired axppci33, I ran<br>
into a strange bit of behavior in disk druid and fdisk. This inst-<br>
allation is just a familiarization run as I have never touched an<br>
alpha or RH before. Anyway, there are two IDE drives(ex-paperweights)<br>
attached. /dev/hda is 400MB and hdb is 100MB. I had planned to<br>
install on hda and put swap on hdb. When the 'druid comes up, the<br>
only drive that I can access is hdb! No matter what I did, I could<br>
not get access to hda. After screwing around trying to find my way<br>
to hda, I gave up and canceled, figuring that I could do it with<br>
fdisk. Unfortunately, fdisk is automagically started with /dev/hdb!<br>
<p>
Oh well, I go ahead and install a stripped down system on hdb. In<br>
that respect almost everything is working.<br>
<p>
As far as hda goes, it is working as after a boot I can do a mount<br>
of /dev/hda1 on /mnt and access the ext2 file system that was<br>
already there and waiting to be over-written. Does anyone have any<br>
ideas how hdb could be recognized without hda? hda _is_ detected<br>
during the milo and kernel boot sequences as the correct info on<br>
vendor, model, geometry, etc. is displayed.<br>
<p>
The only problem that I have with the mini system that I did<br>
install on hdb is with the mouse. It is a serial mouse and the<br>
motherboard is the "AT" version without a ps/2 port. The install<br>
program detects a mouse on "psaux" whether I have the mouse<br>
attached or not. I assume that is the ps/2 mouse port. I have<br>
tried linking /dev/mouse to /dev/cua[0,1], hooking the mouse to<br>
the appropriate header on the motherboard, and manually killing/<br>
starting gpm with the -t option, but no avail, I still get no<br>
sign that the mouse is working.<br>
<p>
Thanks for your advice,<br>
Marc<br>
