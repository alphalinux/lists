</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; it uses a smaller pitch cable and connector. I would be willing to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bet that the controller is just a &quot;standard&quot; part as well, you should 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be able to tell by looking at the floppy driver source in alpha linux 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but I haven't looked recently.
</EM><BR>
<P>It differs from the PC floppy controller as far as the Linux floppy device
<BR>
driver is concerned, probably due more to DMA/memory access preferences and
<BR>
BIOS calls of the underlying architecture.
<BR>
<P>1.) the floppy drive is always reported as 2.88MB under Linux.  Although I
<BR>
have no factual information to back this, I suspect it is not the case
<BR>
under NT or Digital UNIX (chime in here folks and lay down the slap of
<BR>
reason if I am mistaken).  We all know it works properly; it should
<BR>
therefore be able to be detected (cosmetically) properly.
<BR>
<P>2.) the floppy tape driver works on intel and not on Alpha.  I have taken a
<BR>
quick peek at the sources to the ftape driver and I suspect this may simply
<BR>
be a case of non-portable programming or apathy to support non-x86
<BR>
architectures on behalf of the ftape maintainer (his personal comments to
<BR>
me on the issue have lead me to this conclusion).
<BR>
<P>I have looked at the kernel sources (briefly); there is an &lt;asm/floppy.h&gt;
<BR>
which obviously is going to contain platform-specific code to handle the
<BR>
floppy driver.  From the comments in it, it would appear to the novice
<BR>
(like me) that proper support for deducing the floppy type from the BIOS
<BR>
(console in this case) in not implemented.  Perhaps it can't be.  Without
<BR>
some documentation I won't ever know.
<BR>
<P>I am therefore wondering if anyone can provide me with locations of useful
<BR>
programming information or references [in addition to the kernel] for
<BR>
writing a floppy device driver for an Alpha.
<BR>
<P>thanks,
