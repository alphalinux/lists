<EM>&gt; Can anyone comment on the compatibility of Applixware with Excel97 and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Word97 ?  We had version 4.1.x of Applixware, and it did only a mediocre
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; job of importing and exporting...  Also, is there some deal availabel if I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to buy both Intel and Alpha versions?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the SuSE &quot;version&quot; of Applix 4.4.1 for the Intel machine, and 
<BR>
SuSE has posted patches for the Office97 import files on its site -- apparently 
<BR>
updates that appeared after their Linux Office Suite 99 hit the streets. So far, 
<BR>
it's done an excellent job of pulling both Office97 / Mac Office98 and earlier 
<BR>
Word and Excel files. I haven't done things with any of the Microsoft products 
<BR>
that are particularly &quot;on the edge&quot; so there may be glitches out there 
<BR>
somewhere, but I can live with that. We only recently got Microsoft to make the 
<BR>
Mac version compatible with the Winders version, so what the heck...
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;www.linuxmall.com sells the SuSE Linux Office Suite 99 (which includes 
<BR>
Applix, KDE, Communicator, SuSE 5.3, AdabasD, Arkeia, GIMP, GNOME, Xemacs, LaTeX 
<BR>
and who knows what else) for less than they sell the Applix 4.4.1 package 
<BR>
(though I'm betting that the documentation is different) by itself. They will be 
<BR>
selling the Applix for Alpha version as well (ask them about availability) and 
<BR>
they usually sell at some kind of discount price. In addition, if you order from 
<BR>
their website, they'll take another 5% off most orders.
