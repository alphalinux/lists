<EM>&gt; I'm considering buying an Alpha workstation, based on a UX board as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they appear to be faster and cheaper than the rapidly vanishing LX
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boards.  I intend to get 256 MB of SDRAM to start with and soup it up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to at least 512 MB as soon as my wallet recovers.  However I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concerned because in the past several people mentioned problems with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; large memory configurations.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is anyone out there running on UX boards with more than 256 MB?  If so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have you had any trouble?  Did you find a work-around or have you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gotten stuck with unsolvable problems?
</EM><BR>
<P>Our experience:  I have spent perhaps one or two hundred hours on 
<BR>
three UX's during the period july-october, doing all kind of tests.
<BR>
Eventually we gave up and swapped them with LX's.    All the previous 
<BR>
problems disappeared and we could put the machines in production almost 
<BR>
instantly.   My only regret is that we did not do this before.
<BR>
<P>Of course, UX problems could have been solved by now, and there
<BR>
are people who always have been happy with them.
