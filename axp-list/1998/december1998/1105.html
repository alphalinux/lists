<P>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Or how about this,... do a tail -f /etc/HOSTNAME or a watch -n 1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; /etc/HOSTNAME.... and watch exactly what happens as you logon to your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; ISP... then you'll know exactly what step of the ISP logon process is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; changing your HOSTNAME...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Thanks for all of the ideas. I wrote a script and when I did tail -f
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;/etc/HOSTNAME I got:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;X(719): unaligned trap at ooooooo12022d8a4: 00000155564f7244 2d 8 (and 
</EM><BR>
3
<BR>
<EM>&gt;more)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;then the change came.
</EM><BR>
<P>Uh.. hmm... okay... it seems like your X is giving some problems, but I 
<BR>
doubt that is directly related to your HOSTNAME concerns.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ps -aux showed pid 719 to be /usr/X11R6/bin/Xwrapper owned by root. (I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;am dialing in from a user not root)
</EM><BR>
<P>This I don't think has much to do with it... in fact, X should not have 
<BR>
anything to do with the networking.... You may have just discovered 
<BR>
another problem you may have... but unalignment errors are so common on 
<BR>
Alpha... especially with 32bit ported code.... I've been trying to fix a 
<BR>
dozen things in the last month or so....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; By the way, what's the big deal? Is this changing HOSTNAME screwing 
</EM><BR>
up
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; some application that happens to use it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It happens both with usernet from redhat and my own script. If this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not a big problem I certainly can live with it. Not much of a security
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problem as I don't log in often or for long periods. Rarely more than 
</EM><BR>
15
<BR>
<EM>&gt;to 20 mins at a time.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think a changing HOSTNAME is anything of a security problem. In 
<BR>
some sense, it is perhaps more secure, as a potential intruder can't 
<BR>
lock down on a target if you hostname/IP changes all the time.
