Maurice,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess what you found is that it can be quite rough being on the
<BR>
&quot;leading edge&quot; of Alpha Linux - I went to check the Applix website and
<BR>
found
<BR>
the following:
<BR>
<P>(quote)
<BR>
What You Get in this Boxed Set: A CD-ROM containing the eight
<BR>
applications
<BR>
that comprise Applixware for LINUX (Words, Graphics, Spreadsheets, Mail,
<BR>
Data, Builder, HTML Author, and Presents); Release Notes; the Make It
<BR>
Happen
<BR>
Book (a hands-on guide to using Applixware); and a Unique Customer
<BR>
Number. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^ ^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^ ^^ ^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^
<BR>
(To be fair, that seems to describe what you report finding in the
<BR>
box...)
<BR>
<P>Simply click on the box above to purchase Applixware for Linux online!
<BR>
Now
<BR>
available on Intel and COMPAQ Alpha processors.
<BR>
<P><P>Additional Applixware for Linux product offerings include the
<BR>
Developer Bundle, incorporating the five-volume Developer
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^
<BR>
Book Bundle for $189; the Red Hat Applixware for Linux
<BR>
^^^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^ ^^^^
<BR>
(This looks like what you &quot;would have ordered, had you known...)
<BR>
<P>Upgrade for $79; the Applixware books, available either as
<BR>
bound volumes or in *.pdf format for download; product support;
<BR>
and product upgrades. See Documentation, Tech Support, and
<BR>
Buy It! for further details.
<BR>
<P>I suspect that you were mis-led because the web pages were not updated
<BR>
properly when you ordered, or they heeded your suggestion and updated
<BR>
their web site, either way, it looks OK to me today (maybe you can
<BR>
use the confusion to get the books sent to you without shipping charges,
<BR>
just a thought...).
<BR>
<P>Ken

<EM>&gt;   On another note, I thought the documentation included with the packages
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was a bit lightweight, and now I see why!

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; You guys are selling the manuals for a separate $99 !!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is REALLY annoying..

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would have gladly paid that to get it with it originally, if it was made

<EM>&gt; clear what the difference was between the &quot;regular&quot; and the &quot;developer&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; versions.

<EM>&gt;  Now I get to wait another couple of weeks, and pay yet another exorbitant
