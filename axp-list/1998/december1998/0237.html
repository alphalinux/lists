<EM>&gt; &gt; Sounds like you're using the DU 4.x libs with a 2.0.x kernel. You need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to either use the 3.2 libs or upgrade to a 2.1 series kernel.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You're right on the money!  Argh...  Unfortunately, I only have a license
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the 4.0B DU, not the 3.2, and I don't even have access to a DU3.2 box
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyway.  Now, you may say, WELL THEN UPGRADE KERNELS, and you're probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right, but I was looking for the path of least resistance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, thanks anyway!  At least I know where my problem is.

<P>You have some other options if you *just* want a graphical browser (no
<BR>
mail, no news).

<P>Mozilla has been compiled for Linux/Alpha and works reasonably well if
<BR>
you don't need java. I'm at work right now so I don't have the location
<BR>
for it handy, mail me privately if you can't find it in this list's
<BR>
archives and I'll dig it up.
<BR>
<P>HotJava also runs well if you have a fast machine and it does do java
<BR>
(but no javascript). It's reasonably fast on my 533Mhz. box but I once
<BR>
tried it on a 166Mhz. Alphastation and it crawled.
<BR>
<P>The KDE file manager, KFM, does a credible job of displaying basic web
<BR>
pages if you want to install KDE. I don't use it for that because it
<BR>
won't do authentication of private pages (or if it does I haven't
<BR>
figured out how).
