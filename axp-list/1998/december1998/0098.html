<P><EM>&gt; Hi all -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've put the gtk &amp; glib 1.1.5 pkgs on the box (already had the motif 124),
</EM><BR>
<P>Same here.  (I was fairly impressed by the inclusion of .spec files in
<BR>
the tarballs... those GTK folk know their stuff.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; added stuff to LD_LIBRARY_PATH as complained about (or symlinked things),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and after about four days still have yet to get the lizard to build.
</EM><BR>
<P>I can get it to BUILD, but not run.  The new &quot;SpiderMonkey&quot; (i.e.
<BR>
NGLayout) build is FAR cleaner than the old &quot;classic&quot; build, but there are
<BR>
still a few warnings, and it still doesn't run.
<BR>
<P>On the up side, the symptom I'm experiencing has been reported by others
<BR>
in the newsgroups.  On the down side, it's been reported as a symptom of
<BR>
several totally different, unrelated errors.  My particular error is
<BR>
occurring somewhere in the guts of reading preferences.js.
<BR>
<P>I've concluded that it's either a 64-bit issue (since that's what was
<BR>
implied by one of the developers when I posted to the newsgroup), or a
<BR>
threads issue.  Apparently it's possible to configure GTK+ to use pthreads
<BR>
or something, which hoses Mozilla and/or NSPR when it/they attempt to use
<BR>
threads themselves.  I'm about to try a rebuild of Mozilla with user
<BR>
threads instead of pthreads and see if that helps.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Can anyone come up with a recipe?
</EM><BR>
<P>Here's what I did:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* build NSPR mostly according to the instructions at
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/autoconf">http://www.mozilla.org/projects/autoconf</A>, i.e.:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make DIST=/usr/local/nspr NS_DISTMODE=copy MOZILLA_CLIENT=1 \
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NO_MDUPDATE=1 USE_PTHREADS= export
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* configure mozilla via:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/nspr/lib
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mkdir obj-alpha-unknown-linux
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cd obj-alpha-unknown-linux
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;../configure --with-nspr=/usr/local/nspr \
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--with-gtk-prefix=/usr/local/gtk+ --enable-debug
<BR>
<P>By and by, I get a binary, that runs and dies via SIGSEGV deep in parsing
<BR>
preferences.js. (And yes, I've tried moving the old ~/.netscape dir to see
<BR>
if it isn't just Mozilla horfing on a bad preferences.js.)
<BR>
<P>So, that's my status.  Anyone else have any luck?
<BR>
<P><P>BTW, there actually is a Mozilla &quot;porting&quot; list;  I've Cc:-ed it:

<P>It's pretty quiet, though maybe it we can change that.  :)
