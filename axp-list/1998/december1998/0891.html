<P><EM>&gt; Does the ASUSCom ISDN card have a linux driver?....how well does it

<EM>&gt; perform?.
</EM><BR>
<P>It does... Together with a lot of other cards And it performs just great
<BR>
(on i386 box, but I don't see why it wouldn't an alpha). 
<BR>
<P>Another benefit of ISDN card - that I forgot to mention befor - is that I
<BR>
can use two ISDN channels separatly (one for PPP to ISP and another for
<BR>
something else - like dialin or voice mail or...).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; why yes?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Because it WORKS.   You hang it off the serial port (or the 16750 card)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and it'll run (at 230kbps with compression on the 16750).  No conflicts,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothting to configure...just looks like a BIG honkin modem.  Has nifty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; little status/data transfer lights so you can SEE that things are/are not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happening.  No extra drivers needed...(well..maybe for the 16750..but that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really shouldn't need a special driver...just should use a regular serial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; driver.)   This is 99.99999999999999% guaranteed to work.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I'd say it looks JUST like a modem. ISDN comes with many goodies and
<BR>
a device emulating JUST a modem ignores most of them OR you need special
<BR>
software (suplied by the manufactorer - and probably just for Wintendo OS)
<BR>
to make use them. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you get an ISDN card, it takes up a slot, you need a special driver
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (unless it has a 16750 UART built on/emulated),  it may/may not take up an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; irq, port, dma, etc....all pretty precious resources.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, it's all true, but it goes just the same for additional 16750 UART
<BR>
(I never had one, but I guess it needs an IRQ, an I/O port just like
<BR>
16550A, right?).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; now....it all comes down to a matter of price and personal preference.....I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prefer external modems over internal....I've had way too many problems with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; internal modems over the many years of my computer experience to WANT to use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one myself.  However, internals are cheaper...so people buy them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Personal preference has a great deal here, together with needs (I can
<BR>
spare a ISA slot for ISDN card, somebody else can't). A price is also
<BR>
important, ~30$ for an ISDN card is much nicer than ~80$ for 16750 alone,
<BR>
not even mentioning an external ISDN TA (probably ~250$ or more).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do whatever you want...I was just making a suggestion....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Well... Thanks. :)))
