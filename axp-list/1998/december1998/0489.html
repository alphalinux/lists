<EM>&gt; &gt; Sheesh, 60 bucks. I don't even need one and I ordered two :)

<EM>&gt; Beware.  I have two of the first round machines that have everything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in them except for socketed CPU and cache.  These machines are not for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the faint hearted.  Without a floppy or hard drive you will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; challenged to make them run.  While there is an IDE interface, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connector is non-standard. The floppy is a scsi device and I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think anyone makes SCSI hard drives that fit into these cases.
</EM><BR>
<P>The so-called &quot;slim line&quot; 3.5 inch drives fit perfectly.  These are
<BR>
.75 inches tall.  I picked up a 1GB drive for $45.00  It was a
<BR>
DEC RZ26.  You can buy new drives that will fit also.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; you can run an external, but the key utility to these machines is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they're self-contained.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.  I am told that Multia will boot off the network and run
<BR>
&quot;diskless&quot;. I have a disk so have not (yet) tried.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Since the world is going 100BaseT, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; internal net card may be useless.  For example, I have 100BaseT only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hubs.
</EM><BR>
<P>Cheap trick:  Drop a cheap 10Base2 card in one of your other computers
<BR>
that has a spare slot.  That computer then becomes a router and connects
<BR>
your 10Base2 (coax, aka, BNC) LAN with your 100BaseT LAN
