<EM>&gt; &gt;I think 2.0.36 needs patches as does every other kernel I have

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that the kernel folks don't test the kernel very thoroughly for each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;patch.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I'd expect that there will always be an alpha patch until they have QC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;for kernel releases.

<EM>&gt; All the recent 2.1.xxx kernels compile without patches for axp.

<P>Note he said 2.0.36, NOT 2.1.xxx. Some folks don't like the
<BR>
bleeding edge...
<BR>
<P>A simple solution would be for some kind soul to donate
<BR>
an Alpha box to Alan Cox so he can test it himself.
<BR>
Without his interest in solving the problem, it won't
<BR>
get fixed any time soon.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; QC is a corporate buzzword.  You're in the wrong universe.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Don't know what you do but those of us who write SW
<BR>
for a living and get paid for it, whether working 
<BR>
for a corporation or not, do care about QC and maintain
<BR>
test suites for our code. Check out how extensive the
<BR>
test suites are for EGCS if you think that's a a bad
<BR>
idea.
<BR>
<P>Try dealing with irate customers when your code doesn't 
<BR>
do what you told them it will do. If the only one who
<BR>
uses your code is you, maybe QC isn't much of an
<BR>
issue. You just irritate yourself.
<BR>
<P>Non-Intel QC of Linux and lots of other GPL'd code is 
<BR>
not as good as it could be. See solution above. 
<BR>
<P>Course most people don't care about 64bit coding now so
<BR>
they'll live to regret their decision to ignore Alphas
<BR>
in the next year or so. It's a pain in the *** leading the 
<BR>
way sometimes.
