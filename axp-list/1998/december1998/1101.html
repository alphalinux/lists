<EM>&gt; &gt; Even if you are using DHCP it is hard to imagine that your ISP is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;smart&quot; that it rewrites your sysconfig files. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think the ISP is writing to this file. I think there is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something internally wrong with my set up. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Probably not. :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; /etc/sysconfig/network is:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; NETWORKING=YES
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; FORWARD_IPV4=NO
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; HOSTNAME=localhost.localdomain
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^^^
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hm, I would put something here; even if only for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an &quot;internal&quot; use. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; GATEWAYDEV=
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; GATEWAY=
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit includes the lines:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if [ -f /etc/sysconfig/network ]; then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	. /etc/sysconfig/network
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; else
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	NETWORKING=no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	HOSTNAME=localhost
</EM><BR>
<P>More important are lines below:
<BR>
<P># Set the hostname.
<BR>
hostname ${HOSTNAME}
<BR>
echo hostname: `hostname`
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; This is what happens:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I boot clean with &quot;localhost.localdomain&quot; in my /etc/HOSTNAME file.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If I dial in to my ISP this file (etc/HOSTNAME) is changed as soon as I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; am logged in the ISP and have been assigned an IP address. (example
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a021.pm3-1.nwk.infinet.com)
</EM><BR>
<P>The above seems to mean that you are using DHCP protocol to lease
<BR>
IP address and a name under which you are visible &quot;outside&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Taking that example if I open /etc/HOSTNAME after I log in to the ISP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the file will read &quot;a021.pm3-1.nwk.infinet.com&quot; localhost.localdomain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will not be in this file.
</EM><BR>
<P>DHCP client writes a few files (like resolv.conf) usually in a private
<BR>
directory, like /etc/dhcp/, and executes a setup script.  It sounds
<BR>
like this scripts overwrites your /etc/HOSTNAME file (which is not very
<BR>
significant on its own anyway) with something probably from /etc/dhcp/.
<BR>
Apparently it also performs some other actions.  Why you would like to
<BR>
have in /etc/HOSTNAME somethings like localhost.localdomain is beyond
<BR>
my comprehension.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If I open another terminal with ctl-alt-F2 then the login prompt will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [&gt; [jmd@a021 jmd]$
</EM><BR>
<P>Prompt is set in your shell startup files (this depends on your login
<BR>
shell - but assuming that this is bash these will be /etc/profile,
<BR>
/etc/bashrc, ~/.bash_profile and ~/.bashrc).  You will see there
<BR>
something like 'PS1=.....' and /etc/HOSTNAME is not consulted in the
<BR>
process unless you make it to;  check for yourself by changing
<BR>
a contents of /etc/HOSTNAME and opening new shell.  BTW - I think that
<BR>
a default prompt in Red Hat configuration is very bad choice.
<BR>
You will find that pretty soon if you will try to check something
<BR>
in your various 'bin' subdirectories.  Not a very big deal as you can
<BR>
change that any way you want.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I changed the permissions for /etc/HOSTNAME to 444 and it still wrote to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the file.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not wrote but apparently replaced it with something else.  That is
<BR>
another, not equivalent, operation.
<BR>
<P>You are still not presenting the whole story.  One has to guess what
<BR>
you are really doing (dhcp and its setup).  You also claimed that
<BR>
a new name shows after the next boot.  It is not clear how but your
<BR>
computer is doing only what it was told to do.
