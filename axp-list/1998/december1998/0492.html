<P>
<EM>&gt; connector is non-standard. The floppy is a scsi device and I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think anyone makes SCSI hard drives that fit into these cases.  Sure,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you can run an external, but the key utility to these machines is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they're self-contained.  Since the world is going 100BaseT, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; internal net card may be useless.  For example, I have 100BaseT only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hubs.

<P>Just arrived today. 2 SCSI 1.0GB 2.5&quot; drives.  They were purchased for 350
<BR>
each from a place that deals with APPLE powerbooks.  The label says APS
<BR>
Technologies.
