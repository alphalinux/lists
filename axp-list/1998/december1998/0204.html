<EM>&gt;&gt;So, I started looking at Cheaper Than Dirt (TM) Brand ISA SCSI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;controllers, and of course I found the Iomega &quot;ZIP Zoom&quot; SCSI 2 adapter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;This is US$34, which is more in line, and I'd like to pick it up,
</EM><BR>
assuming
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;it'll work in my SX164.  Unfortunately I see no &quot;ZIP Zoom&quot; driver in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;kernel source.  So, I have a few questions:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 1.  Does anyone have any experience with this particular adapter,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;     and will it work in my SX164?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 2.  What IS this adapter?  (i.e. does it have drive support under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;     a different name?)
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I don't remember.  The 'Jaz Jet' is an usually an Advansys chip (PCI).  The
<BR>
LDP has/had a Zip-HOWTO that covered this deep in the bowels of the doc.
<BR>
Check it out.  Don't expect support from Iomega getting this thing to work,
<BR>
period.  Even in a system that they say should support it, as they charge
<BR>
20$ a pop for phone help, even if you did just buy 500$ worth of their
<BR>
product.
<BR>
<P>Remember, the kernel source cannot know/include every manufacturer that has
<BR>
products based on certain chipsets, wich this happens with the ESS chip
<BR>
lines, DEC's net chips.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;In any case, this is all quite &quot;do-able&quot; without sticking yet another card
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and set of drivers into your system. The $68 price tag for the cable is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bit outrageous.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Attaching narrow devices to wide bus connections is not a problem, as long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as you make sure the termination is deal with.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I paid 28$ (in the USA) for my external-wide to external-narrow 3-foot (1
<BR>
meter) cable.  It works like a dandy.  Yes, setting port termination
<BR>
low-off, high-on is recommended.  For a while I had all high (whoops) it
<BR>
worked for a while, but the SCSI bus eventually locked.
<BR>
<P>As for pricing, I'm with you on that.  CompUSA tries to sell high-density
<BR>
50 pin SCSI cables for 60$.  I thought that was horrible until I saw same
<BR>
at a start-up store for 120$.  Es ist schrechlich.
