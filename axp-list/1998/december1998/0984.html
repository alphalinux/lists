Hi david,
<BR>
<P>its a continouing story, i found out what was the problem with the serial ports; those alpha noname's have a different pinout for the serial port so i had to make a new serial cable, which is working now. Thanks again for your help.
<BR>
<P>Now i am using kernel 2.0.34, i recompiled it to enable masquerading which is working although i got some unaligned trap warnings when booting but thats the next problem to tackle.
<BR>
<P>i think 2.0.34 should be doing fine with the higher speeds, the uarts in the alpha are 16550A models, do you have an idea at what speed they are capable of ?
<BR>
<P>should i do something with setserial before executing the dip script ?, i tried setting the port to spd_vhi but this didn't change much.
<BR>

<EM>&gt;Hi,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;i got my axppci33 noname alpha working with a cablemodem after much
</EM><BR>
trouble because
<BR>
<EM>&gt; i set the portspeed to 115200. this is probably to fast. i got it working
</EM><BR>
now with
<BR>
<EM>&gt; portspeed set to 19200. this is much slower than the cablemodem can provide.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Does anybody have experience with higher speeds or a suggesting for a
</EM><BR>
serial bord which
<BR>
<EM>&gt; has newer uarts and works fine with linux in an alpha ?
</EM><BR>
<P>What kernel are you using? A lot of the 2.0.'s wouldn't cope with 56K/115K2
<BR>
- I know
<BR>
that the newer 2.1.'s do; I suspect the later 2.0.'s do as well.
