hmm...
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these two things aren't really that linked apart from in my
<BR>
head so don't go jumping to conclusions!
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motherboards: we've got a couple of 533MHz 21164a's
<BR>
loitering around as the result of trying to destroy my lx164
<BR>
(or getting VMS to run on it, whichever you prefer). We 
<BR>
thought we'd make another machine or two with them, until
<BR>
we contacted dec (we're a digital oem) and were told the 
<BR>
price for a motherboard was £1033 ($1700?), which is a bit
<BR>
steep. Anyone know what the going rate for a Samsung board
<BR>
is, or for that matter what digipaq/comtal sells them for in
<BR>
the US?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memory: completely unrelated. We recently acquired a
<BR>
large amount of memory for alphas when one of our customers
<BR>
upgraded a load of alphastations. Thus we've ended up with
<BR>
about 70 pieces of 16Mb SIMMS that came from alphastation
<BR>
250s. They're genuine DEC (even got Digital Equipment 
<BR>
Corporation written on them!) and work in alphastations and 
<BR>
nonames: not tried them in anything else but I'm sure someone
<BR>
round here will know what else they'll go in (don't *think* they
<BR>
work in most multias but I haven't tried it). We haven't really got
<BR>
a definite plan on how to dispose of them yet but I was wondering
<BR>
if any of the good people on this list might have an interest in
<BR>
them..
<BR>
<P>cheers
