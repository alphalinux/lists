<EM>&gt;&gt; Another solution is to get a SCSI Zip with a parallel port adapter. A
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You can do that? I have a ext scsi zip and this is the first time I heard
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt;this. So just get an adapter and plug it into any PC and it will work?
</EM><BR>
That's
<BR>
<EM>&gt;neat :).
</EM><BR>
<P><P>It can be done.  The SyQuest SyJet 1.5GB Parallel was actually a SCSI drive
<BR>
with a parallel-&gt;SCSI adaptor :) the Best Buy sales person didn't know what
<BR>
he was talking about when I asked about that anomaly.  It is nice, but
<BR>
slow, as par port is slow, but it is usable for backup.  Linux has some
<BR>
support for this.  You can chain multiple drives to that too, whereas the
<BR>
documentation says no (they lie or misconstrue, but they probably don't
<BR>
want to support that kind of stuff).  It is really an special cable made by
<BR>
a company called Shuttle.  I have two that I am not using.  I suppose I
<BR>
wouldn't mind giving one up for about shipping cost, but it would be as-is
<BR>
b/c I haven't used them since I sold my rePentium 133, and I have real SCSI
<BR>
on both my systems.  I have no driver disks or docs either.
