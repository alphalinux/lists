<P><EM>&gt; But first, just a list of some observations I've made....

...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; However, that's about where all the good things stop.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; With 2.1.131 I am now having problems with my tulip driver/ethernet 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; card. First I noticed the 131 kernel comes with a very old version of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tulip.c ... I replaced it with the newer version that was with 2.0.36 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and recompiled... yet, same problem. 
</EM><BR>
<P>The version of the tulip driver that comes in the devel kernels is not
<BR>
stock; there are two code paths on tulip right now (bleah).  One that
<BR>
Donald does (ie. the latest) and the one in the devel kernels, which is
<BR>
based on an older driver, but has fast-routing and some other tweaks.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The symptoms of the problem are: 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when I try to use ipfwadm, I get the error message I got when I used the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; default ipfwadm that came with RH 5.2. Which is as if it wasn't compiled 
</EM><BR>
<P>ipfwadm is obsolete in the new kernels; you need ipchains.  There is a good
<BR>
deal of documentation in the kernel; see Documentation/Changes.  In case
<BR>
you want to dual boot 2.0 and 2.1, there is an ipchains patch for 2.0.  See
<BR>
the ipchains website.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; also, my routing table is awkward. Every entry is duplicated. But if I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shutdown all the interfaces (3 of them, eth0,eth1, eth2) and restart 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them manually, the routing table is fine.
</EM><BR>
<P>Two things to check here; make sure you have the latest init scripts and
<BR>
the latest net-tools.  Network interfaces were changed in many ways in the
<BR>
2.1 kernel.  I think there is documentation on this in the kernel, as well.
<BR>
I think the specific issue you're dealing with is that routes are
<BR>
automatically assigned on interface configuration now.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; the third problem I think I just figured out... for some odd reason eth0 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and eth1 got swapped... they both use the tulip driver. So thats 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably why the I couldn't get out to the net using eth0.... as my net 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connection was switched to eth1.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's odd... not one I've heard of.  Which console do you use?  The tulip
<BR>
driver works by iterating through the PCI BIOS in search of successive
<BR>
devices matching the class/devid.  If it's a problem for you, there is a
<BR>
#define in the tulip.c driver that can be set for reverse detection.  This
<BR>
would at least allow you to keep the same interface names across 2.0/2.1
<BR>
boots.  BTW, you might want to try the de4x5 driver as well.
