<P>
I was compiling some things yesterday, and I was also running ppp
<BR>
and for some reason I got a kernel panic.  When I rebooted, the
<BR>
system tried to run fsck, but it failed, saying I need to login
<BR>
as a single user and run it without the -a option.  
<BR>
<P>It asked for my root password. I typed it in, and it then gave
<BR>
a few errors that the fs was locked, and then it rebooted itself.
<BR>
<P>Two questions:
<BR>
- I also tried going into singleuser mode by adding &quot;single&quot; to the end
<BR>
of my load options in Milo.  Is that the right way to do it?  It did not
<BR>
work either.
<BR>
<P>- How can I boot off the redhat cdrom?  What parameters in milo are needed?
<BR>
<P>Any suggestions on easier ways to fix this?  I am working on a final project
<BR>
for my CS class, so this is bad (however, I do have a backup... but I'd 
<BR>
rather do it in linux than anywhere else)
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
Jon
