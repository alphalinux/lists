Hummm . . . personally, I really don't care if the man acts like an ass or
<BR>
not.  It's a free country and he has the right to be what he is.  I prefer
<BR>
to see if the &quot;proof is in the pudding&quot; . . . meaning, if the product can
<BR>
do as advertised, under stress, then I'm happy.  My goal is the smooth
<BR>
operation of my services, not engaging in flame-wars.
<BR>
<P>Currently, sendmail *is* the ranking king of Internet e-mail services.
<BR>
It's old, tested, tried, and true.  Eric, the creator of sendmail, is also
<BR>
working on better security and functionality for the product all the time.
<BR>
It may be a bit hard to configure sometimes, depending on what you want 
<BR>
it to do, but you can't get that kind of flexibility without having a
<BR>
certain amount of complication. Sendmail Pro will probably come, someday,
<BR>
with a GUI interface to compile, install, configure, and maintain it.  I
<BR>
wish Eric luck in this endeavor.
<BR>
<P>Bottom line: Make my life easier and you're the greatest thing since
<BR>
sliced bread.  Make it more complicated?  I won't remember your name.
<BR>
Simple.
<BR>
<P>Just my $0.02.
<BR>
<P>Enjoy!

<EM>&gt; &gt; I've to second this. People who name qmail as being easily configurable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; spend days on writing custom C code. Compared to that, sendmail is really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a dream in terms of customization/configuration.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, I use sendmail rather than qmail mostly because everytime qmail is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mentioned on Usenet, the author barges in and start flaming everybody who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disagrees with him and generally acting like a sociopath.  I don't trust
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything written by somebody like that - he's obviously not open to
