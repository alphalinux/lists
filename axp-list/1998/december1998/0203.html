<P>
With regards to your message at 04:31 PM 12-04-98 -0500, Dan Morrill. Where
<BR>
you stated:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I currently have a parallel port ZIP drive, but I promised it to my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;father, since I also have a SCSI (2) ZIP drive kicking around.  I have an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;NCR53C875 UW SCSI controller, but its external connector is the 68-pin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;micropin form factor, and the ZIP SCSI cable is 25-pin on both ends.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I found a cable that looks like it *might* work, but it is US$68, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;just isn't something I'm going to pay to get a drive working for which I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;paid US$60 in the first place.  Besides, I'm not sure it'll even work.
</EM><BR>
This is a bt of an exorbitant price to pay for a cable like this, -*maybe*-
<BR>
The &quot;68 pin connector&quot; you mention could either be an HD68 connector or a
<BR>
.8mm pitch Centronics connector. If the former, a cable should cost about
<BR>
$17.50 If it is the more &quot;exotic&quot; mini Centronics about $45.
<BR>
I guess the best way to tell is to ask: &quot;What brand and model of SCSI card
<BR>
_do_ you have?&quot; The NCR53C875 is the chip on the card, not the card itself.
<BR>
<P>Next, we need to address one little detail:
<BR>
A 68 pin SCSI connector means a wide (16 bit) SCSI bus. Now, think of wide
<BR>
SCSI as simply 2 narrow(8-bit) buses in the same connection. The problem we
<BR>
have to deal with is to ensure that if you connect only narrow devices on
<BR>
this external connector you need to disable any termination on the low
<BR>
8-bit portion, and make sure it stays enabled on the high 8-bit half.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So, I started looking at Cheaper Than Dirt (TM) Brand ISA SCSI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;controllers, and of course I found the Iomega &quot;ZIP Zoom&quot; SCSI 2 adapter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is US$34, which is more in line, and I'd like to pick it up, assuming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it'll work in my SX164.  Unfortunately I see no &quot;ZIP Zoom&quot; driver in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;kernel source.  So, I have a few questions:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	1.  Does anyone have any experience with this particular adapter,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	    and will it work in my SX164?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	2.  What IS this adapter?  (i.e. does it have drive support under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	    a different name?)
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Now, I asked a similar question once before, and I believe Jay said that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in general ISA SCSI cards on Alphae are problematic, so I'm not hopeful,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but I figured I'd ask anyway, before I break down and buy another parallel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;port drive (which I can get cheaper than the cable) and try and unload
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this SCSI deal.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

</EM><BR>
<P>In any case, this is all quite &quot;do-able&quot; without sticking yet another card
<BR>
and set of drivers into your system. The $68 price tag for the cable is a
<BR>
bit outrageous.
<BR>
Attaching narrow devices to wide bus connections is not a problem, as long
<BR>
as you make sure the termination is deal with.
<BR>
