<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The floppy is a scsi device
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Since WHEN?  That sure isn't a standard SCSI connector, and even so, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't show up on SCSI chain diagnostics.  It is a normal floppy.  I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seen other floppies with that kind of a connector.
</EM><BR>
<P>I was under the impression that it was merely a really thin floppy (to
<BR>
go in that itty bitty case.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Oops.  These machines are nifty, but I don't consider it to be usable as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; primary machine unless you only now have a 486.  Usable as an Xterm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; oh yeah.
</EM><BR>
<P>I just ordered a Multia (the $99 one, because I need at least one
<BR>
with a floppy in it) and intend to use it as an X terminal in the
<BR>
spare room.  Any gotchas to this (other than the 256 color limitation,
<BR>
which I know about)?  I'll be installing over the house network from
<BR>
another of my Linux boxen.
<BR>
