<P>Beware.  I have two of the first round machines that have everything
<BR>
in them except for socketed CPU and cache.  These machines are not for
<BR>
the faint hearted.  Without a floppy or hard drive you will be
<BR>
challenged to make them run.  While there is an IDE interface, the
<BR>
connector is non-standard. The floppy is a scsi device and I don't
<BR>
think anyone makes SCSI hard drives that fit into these cases.  Sure,
<BR>
you can run an external, but the key utility to these machines is that
<BR>
they're self-contained.  Since the world is going 100BaseT, the
<BR>
internal net card may be useless.  For example, I have 100BaseT only
<BR>
hubs.
<BR>
<P>I also paid much more than 60 corn for mine.
