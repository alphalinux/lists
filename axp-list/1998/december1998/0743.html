Hello,
<BR>
<P>thanks for the answers to my question. In fact I had allready 
<BR>
read the documentation, but measuring with the rpcc failed to find a 
<BR>
instruction sequence that needed less than 1 cycle/instruction.
<BR>
<P>But it is possible indeed as:
<BR>
<P>addq, addq, mult, addt, addq, addq can be execute in 2 or 3 cycles
<BR>
<P>if there are no register dependencys. 
<BR>
Note: this is measured not deducted from the manual.
<BR>
<P>Anyway I think I have to make a few more passes on the documentation
<BR>
to find out how a given sequence is scheduled exactly.
<BR>

<P><EM>&gt; No, in fact they take more -- FP multiplier has pipeline
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         latency of 8 cycles.  FP-add pipeline takes also 8 cycles.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (archive digging --- dec21164pchwm.pdf found ...)
</EM><BR>
<P>My documentation said FP mul/add takes 4 cycles latency

<P><EM>&gt; I'm not sure you would see any given fragment execute in less than 4
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cycles.  Instead, you might see the aggregate performance of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sequence of instructions be less than the sequential fetch time.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's exactly what I was searching for. A explicit written down sequence
<BR>
that actually execute in less cycles than instructions.

<P><EM>&gt; In answer to the question: yes the 21164 can issue up to four
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instructions in one cycle under the right conditions.  The example
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given looks to me like it ought to go through in one as long as it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is correctly aligned, but check the document mentioned in the &quot;ALPHA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instruction timing&quot; thread a few days ago for a definitive answer.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I read the documentation I that that is the kind of sequence that
<BR>
should run at maximum speed, because all instructions can use
<BR>
a different execution unit and no register resource conflicts are
<BR>
there.
<BR>
<P>BUT I measured the time using the rpcc and it says 4 cycles.
<BR>
BUT what is rpcc exactly measuring?

<EM>&gt; to an automated monthly posting containing URL's to FAQ's and other sources
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of Linux/AXP documentation (our fantastic websites, etc)?  I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; volunteer to do it if nobody else does (assuming the overhwelming majority
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of list members like the idea).  The message would not need to be large to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be effective; even a paragraph or so would suffice, I think.
</EM><BR>
<P>Good idea. I voluntieer to contribute a little assembly code
<BR>
example. ;-)
