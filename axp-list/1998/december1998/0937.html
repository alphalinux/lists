Below is an exchange I had with KAI C++ about them supporting the
<BR>
alphalinux platform. In short they've seen enough demand to consider a
<BR>
port though more demand always helps. If I had this I'd forget about
<BR>
getting a DEC C/C++ compiler and wouldn't have to morgage the house to
<BR>
get it ether :).

Hi, I noticed you support many platforms including Digital Unix and
<BR>
Sparc Though I don't see Alphalinux. Why is that? If I may a few
<BR>
questions. Does
<BR>
KAI C++ have a performance increase vs the gcc and current egcs
<BR>
compilers? Does it also do C? If you have no plans of porting to
<BR>
Alphalinux could you
<BR>
direct me to a vendor who does produce an optimized C/C++ compiler for
<BR>
my platform? Thanks for yout time. 
<BR>
<P>Best Regards,

Hi,
<BR>
<P>As a practical matter, we cannot support every platform that exists.  
<BR>
Every port to a new platform requires testing (with each release) and 
<BR>
continued support.  As a result, we try to support the platforms that 
<BR>
will bring the largest number of customers (well, actually, 
<BR>
largest amount of revenue).
<BR>
<P>We have been tracking requests for KAI C++ on Alpha/Linux.  Given the 
<BR>
number of requests that we have received for KAI C++ on Alpha/Linux, we
<BR>
have been considering the possibility of extending support to this 
<BR>
platform.  However, no final decision has been made yet.
<BR>
<P>As for your question regarding performance of KAI C++ generated code 
<BR>
versus gcc or egcs generated codes, the answer depends partly upon the 
<BR>
style of a particular piece of code.  The optimizations of KAI C++ are 
<BR>
aimed at object oriented C++.  So for object oriented C++ codes, you 
<BR>
should, in general, expect to see performance improvements, while for 
<BR>
plain C codes you will not see much improvement.  One caveat with 
<BR>
comparing gcc and KAI C++, is that gcc's C++ library is not as standard 
<BR>
compliant as the one included with KAI C++.  In some areas of the 
<BR>
standard library, such as I/O, standard compliance comes at a
<BR>
performance 
<BR>
cost.  A discussion of how KAI C++ improves performance can be found
<BR>
in 
<BR>
the KAI C++ User Guide at 
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.kai.com/C_plus_plus/online_doc/UserGuide/chapter_3.html">http://www.kai.com/C_plus_plus/online_doc/UserGuide/chapter_3.html</A> .
<BR>
<P>KAI C++ does support Ansi C and K&amp;R C as compilation modes.
<BR>
<P>Off hand, I am not aware of any C++ compilers for Alpha/Linux besides 
<BR>
gcc/g++ and egcs.  If we do decide to support Alpha/Linux, we will let 
<BR>
you know when the product is available.
