<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; With regards to your message at 04:31 PM 12-04-98 -0500, Dan Morrill. Where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you stated:
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;I found a cable that looks like it *might* work, but it is US$68, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;just isn't something I'm going to pay to get a drive working for which I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;paid US$60 in the first place.  Besides, I'm not sure it'll even work.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The &quot;68 pin connector&quot; you mention could either be an HD68 connector or a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; .8mm pitch Centronics connector. If the former, a cable should cost about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; $17.50 If it is the more &quot;exotic&quot; mini Centronics about $45.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's the 68-pin &quot;micro&quot; DB connector.  Not the internal &quot;ribbon&quot; HD
<BR>
connector, and it's definately not Centronics. :)  (If, by Centronics, you
<BR>
in fact mean the &quot;card&quot; adapter, a la floppy drive connectors.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I guess the best way to tell is to ask: &quot;What brand and model of SCSI card
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; _do_ you have?&quot; The NCR53C875 is the chip on the card, not the card itself.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have no idea.  Aspen Systems shipped this thing to me without
<BR>
documenting it on the invoice, and sent me no manuals at all except the
<BR>
manual for the original DEC SX164 motherboard.  I could rip it open and
<BR>
see if the card itself says anything, but it's currently buried under a
<BR>
pile of ZIP drive, Ethernet port, and cable modem, and the Win95 box next
<BR>
to it. :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Next, we need to address one little detail:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A 68 pin SCSI connector means a wide (16 bit) SCSI bus. Now, think of wide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SCSI as simply 2 narrow(8-bit) buses in the same connection. The problem we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to deal with is to ensure that if you connect only narrow devices on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this external connector you need to disable any termination on the low
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 8-bit portion, and make sure it stays enabled on the high 8-bit half.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah... I see.  The ZIP drive would be the only external device, and the
<BR>
only other external SCSI device I'd ever be likely to add is perhaps a
<BR>
scanner, so I would need to pay attention to that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Attaching narrow devices to wide bus connections is not a problem, as long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as you make sure the termination is deal with.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, the only reason I haven't so far is because I just haven't been able
<BR>
to find a cable cheap enough to make it worthwhile.  I've looked at the
<BR>
local CompUSA, NECX Direct, and a couple other online computer shops and
<BR>
only found the aforementioned $68 cable at NECX.  I'll keep looking then;
<BR>
thanks for your response.
<BR>
<P><P>While we're on the subject of SCSI, here's one for you:
<BR>
My HDD is a Seagate ST34371W (3.5&quot;, 4371MB, Ultra Wide) disk.  The card
<BR>
is, again, based on NCR53C875.
<BR>
<P>The device driver for this beast on 2.0.35 seems to only run the card in
<BR>
8bit (just &quot;FAST-10&quot;, I guess?), i.e. 20MB/s, mode.  (At least by default;
<BR>
there may be an option to turn on FAST-20.)  The 2.1.131 device driver,
<BR>
however, runs the card in 16 bit FAST-20 mode.
<BR>
<P>However, `hdparm -tT /dev/sda` shows no substantial difference in reads
<BR>
between the device drivers, and comes out SUBSTANTIALLY slower than my
<BR>
friend's Ultra DMA EIDE drive on a Pentium II 450MHz box.  (my ~9 MB/s
<BR>
&quot;buffered disk read&quot; vs. his ~18MB/s.)  I would expect the disk to show at
<BR>
least a modest increase in speed in 2.1.131, and I would expect the
<BR>
discrepancy between UW SCSI and Ultra DMA to be smaller.
<BR>
<P>I have no trouble believing that Ultra DMA is faster than UW SCSI, but
<BR>
THAT much faster?  Does hdparm just not understand SCSI drives properly?
<BR>
Am I hitting a CPU or bus speed wall of the SX164?  Is there another way
<BR>
to check the speed of my disk, or is that value actually accurate?
