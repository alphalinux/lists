Hi,
<BR>
<P>I would be glad to receive suggestions for a good and stable graphic
<BR>
card. I know I can check XFree 3.3.3 for the supported ones. But this is
<BR>
not the question. I would avoid to have several &quot;small&quot; pains, that often
<BR>
comes with supported but not STABLE pieces.
<BR>
<P>At the moment, I experienced with a S3_Virge, but I found it quite
<BR>
unstable. X-applications (netscape 4.5 most noticeably) totally hang the
<BR>
box. The sw_mouse and no_pci_disconnect options didn't help too much.
<BR>
<P>With a MilleniumII (borrowed from a PC for tests), I'v been much more
<BR>
happy, but I still didn't find the right XF86 configuration to have a
<BR>
fixed frequencies IBM monitor to work. (With the S3 it has been quite
<BR>
simple).
<BR>
<P>What I need, is not a Super-Duper card. Something in the price range of
<BR>
the Millenium, or G200,  would be OK. I would like to have the card
<BR>
working with KDE, no particularly heavy X-applications.
<BR>
<P>Thanks
