<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I would think the restriction is that milo must live within

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the first 1GB on the disk, not what partition it's in.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Does your partition qualify on that?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; No -- My 66 happy machines boot off the 4th partition, which is at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; end of a 4 gig disk. I belive Jay claimed to me once that AlphaBIOS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; shouldn't have any silly limits along those lines.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jay is right.  My Miata at work boots (NT, sigh) from a system partition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at the end of a 4 GB drive.  I then use it to develop AlphaBIOS.  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyone can prove that AlphaBIOS has any such &quot;silly limits&quot;, let me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know and I'll remove them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I suspect that the reported problems have to do with: 1) the known bug
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in mkdosfs (assumption that sizeof (unsigned long) == 4); and 2) following
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the installation instructions and copying the MILO floppy image to the raw
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; partition.  The latter has always made me uncomfortable....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Personally, I got lucky.  The partition I initialized with mkdosfs works
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for me on my XL 300.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I remember reading about Alphas having some sort
<BR>
of problem with larger disk drives. The limit may
<BR>
have been 2GB but it was broken. I don't know if it was
<BR>
ARC/AlphaBios or milo that had the problem but it did
<BR>
exist sometime in the past year or so. Also, older
<BR>
milos can't load larger kernels. When I installed
<BR>
RH5.0, I had to use a new milo in order to get it
<BR>
to boot the kernel. So, if you get bad combinations,
<BR>
things won't work. Getting the latest stuff worked
<BR>
for my systems...
