<EM>&gt;&gt; With regards to your message at 04:31 PM 12-04-98 -0500, Dan Morrill. Where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; you stated:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;I found a cable that looks like it *might* work, but it is US$68, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;just isn't something I'm going to pay to get a drive working for which I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;paid US$60 in the first place.  Besides, I'm not sure it'll even work.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; The &quot;68 pin connector&quot; you mention could either be an HD68 connector or a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; .8mm pitch Centronics connector. If the former, a cable should cost about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; $17.50 If it is the more &quot;exotic&quot; mini Centronics about $45.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It's the 68-pin &quot;micro&quot; DB connector.  Not the internal &quot;ribbon&quot; HD
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;connector, and it's definately not Centronics. :)  (If, by Centronics, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in fact mean the &quot;card&quot; adapter, a la floppy drive connectors.)
</EM><BR>
OK, if it has 2 rows of holes, and probably nuts to accept fine screws at
<BR>
the ends it is a HD68. If it looks like Tiiiiiinyyy Centronics ( like on
<BR>
your printer, but really small) then it is the .8mm microSCSI 5 connector.
<BR>
I think, though, from what you are saying it is the HD68.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; I guess the best way to tell is to ask: &quot;What brand and model of SCSI card
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; _do_ you have?&quot; The NCR53C875 is the chip on the card, not the card itself.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I have no idea.  Aspen Systems shipped this thing to me without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;documenting it on the invoice, and sent me no manuals at all except the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;manual for the original DEC SX164 motherboard.  I could rip it open and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;see if the card itself says anything, but it's currently buried under a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pile of ZIP drive, Ethernet port, and cable modem, and the Win95 box next
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to it. :)
</EM><BR>
Allrighty then, I am _almost_ sure it is an Intraserver, they used lots of
<BR>
those.
<BR>
If it is ( Oh, go have a look, on it's upper surface, close to the back of
<BR>
the machine, it will say 3140U-4 or similar on a white field. Probaly on
<BR>
the outside face of the plate at the back of the case is a decal that says
<BR>
SCSI SE with a diamond shaped symbol.
<BR>
Anyway, to use this get a HD68 to DB25 ( or whatever is on your ZIP) cable.
<BR>
Should be under $20. If not I will sell you one, delivered, for $25.
<BR>
Now, on the SCSI card, there are 2 jumpers, and if you look on the board by
<BR>
them it will say:
<BR>
HDR3 TERMLOW by one, and : HDR15 TERMHIGH by the other. To disable the low
<BR>
termination byte you remove the jumper from the HDR3 TERMLOW pair of pins.
<BR>
If you want to be able to easily enable/diable it you can get a switch
<BR>
that plugs into these 2 pins so that this can be toggled on/off for when
<BR>
you don't atttach and use the ZIP drive. Alternatively a second internal
<BR>
cable assembly can be used to plug into the second internal SCSI connector
<BR>
on the card, and out to a &quot;dummy plate&quot; on the back with an HD50 narrow
<BR>
SCSI connector. Then, you disable that same jumper, and use a narrwo SCSI
<BR>
terminator plugged into that port when you have no device attached to it.
<BR>
Anyway, go cable huntng again, and if you are stuck, let me know, we stock
<BR>
all these various types. Enough spam, before I annoy somebody..  ;^}
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Next, we need to address one little detail:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; A 68 pin SCSI connector means a wide (16 bit) SCSI bus. Now, think of wide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; SCSI as simply 2 narrow(8-bit) buses in the same connection. The problem we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; have to deal with is to ensure that if you connect only narrow devices on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; this external connector you need to disable any termination on the low
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 8-bit portion, and make sure it stays enabled on the high 8-bit half.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ah... I see.  The ZIP drive would be the only external device, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only other external SCSI device I'd ever be likely to add is perhaps a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;scanner, so I would need to pay attention to that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Attaching narrow devices to wide bus connections is not a problem, as long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; as you make sure the termination is deal with.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yeah, the only reason I haven't so far is because I just haven't been able
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to find a cable cheap enough to make it worthwhile.  I've looked at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;local CompUSA, NECX Direct, and a couple other online computer shops and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only found the aforementioned $68 cable at NECX.  I'll keep looking then;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thanks for your response.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;While we're on the subject of SCSI, here's one for you:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;My HDD is a Seagate ST34371W (3.5&quot;, 4371MB, Ultra Wide) disk.  The card
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is, again, based on NCR53C875.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The device driver for this beast on 2.0.35 seems to only run the card in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;8bit (just &quot;FAST-10&quot;, I guess?), i.e. 20MB/s, mode.  (At least by default;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there may be an option to turn on FAST-20.)  The 2.1.131 device driver,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;however, runs the card in 16 bit FAST-20 mode.
</EM><BR>
That is because the driver version is newer, and works better! The ftp site
<BR>
for the SymbiosLogic drivers is:
<BR>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.tux.org/pub/roudier/">ftp://ftp.tux.org/pub/roudier/</A>     Current version is 3.1C.
<BR>
Of course to use a new driver you _will_ have to compile it into a new kernel.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;However, `hdparm -tT /dev/sda` shows no substantial difference in reads
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;between the device drivers, and comes out SUBSTANTIALLY slower than my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;friend's Ultra DMA EIDE drive on a Pentium II 450MHz box.  (my ~9 MB/s
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;buffered disk read&quot; vs. his ~18MB/s.)  I would expect the disk to show at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;least a modest increase in speed in 2.1.131, and I would expect the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discrepancy between UW SCSI and Ultra DMA to be smaller.
</EM><BR>
It should be. Again, what driver version do you have there? Look in
<BR>
var/log/dmesg search for a line like:
<BR>
SCSI0 : ncr53c8xx - revision ????
<BR>
the ???? is the verion of the driver.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I have no trouble believing that Ultra DMA is faster than UW SCSI, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;THAT much faster?  Does hdparm just not understand SCSI drives properly?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Am I hitting a CPU or bus speed wall of the SX164?  Is there another way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to check the speed of my disk, or is that value actually accurate?
</EM><BR>
No, it isn't faster. But then apart from everything else, HDPARM is not the
<BR>
be-all of benchmarks, either. The &quot;real world&quot; apporach is my best
<BR>
recommendation. Copy a big directory tree form one disk to another. Some
<BR>
good disk benchmarks can be found at:

<BR>
In particular bonnie, IOzone are quite realistic..
