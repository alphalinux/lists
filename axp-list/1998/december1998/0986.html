<EM>&gt;Hi david,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;its a continouing story, i found out what was the problem with the serial
</EM><BR>
ports; those alpha noname's have a different pinout for the serial port so
<BR>
i had to make a new serial cable, which is working now. Thanks again for
<BR>
your help.
<BR>
<P>:-) I had exactly the same problem on an Intel machine a few years ago -
<BR>
got confused
<BR>
as hell until I realised there were two 'standards' for the wiring between
<BR>
the connector
<BR>
and the motherboard!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Now i am using kernel 2.0.34, i recompiled it to enable masquerading which
</EM><BR>
is working although i got some unaligned trap warnings when booting but
<BR>
thats the next problem to tackle.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;i think 2.0.34 should be doing fine with the higher speeds, the uarts in
</EM><BR>
the alpha are 16550A models, do you have an idea at what speed they are
<BR>
capable of ?
<BR>
<P>I don't think thats true - I didn't think it was working until at least the
<BR>
late 35's - but to be
<BR>
honest I haven't really done a lot with the 2.0.'s on the Alphas - I
<BR>
started on the 2.1 line almost
<BR>
as soon as I'd got mine going.
<BR>
<P>A 16550A should be able to cook you 115K2.
