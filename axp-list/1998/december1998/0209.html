Hi,
<BR>
<P>Just in case anyone else had the same problem I did, what was causing my 
<BR>
2.1.131 kernel to not boot was the frame buffer stuff for the matrox 
<BR>
millenium II. Once I got rid of that, I was able to boot my system. 
<BR>
However... now I have other problems.... 
<BR>
<P>But first, just a list of some observations I've made....
<BR>
<P>With kernel 2.0.35 I was getting very slow disk access via SCSI 3940UW 
<BR>
controller... and mounting the root partition took several minutes. 
<BR>
Also, if I try to reboot without resetting... basically, going back to 
<BR>
MILO and then booting again, the system would freeze.
<BR>
<P>With kernel 2.0.36 disk access was getting faster.... however, mounting 
<BR>
the root partition still took several minutes. On the good side, 
<BR>
rebooting from MILO (without hard reset) started working.
<BR>
<P>With kernel 2.1.131.... wow... SCSI disk access for the 3940UW was 
<BR>
greatly improved... from what I can tell, the new aic7xxx seems to take 
<BR>
into account expiration times of some sorts... in anycase, disk access 
<BR>
was GREATLY improved... mounting root partition took 6 seconds, starting 
<BR>
X took 2 seconds (took 36 seconds with the 2.0.35 and 36)... 
<BR>
<P>However, that's about where all the good things stop.
<BR>
<P>With 2.1.131 I am now having problems with my tulip driver/ethernet 
<BR>
card. First I noticed the 131 kernel comes with a very old version of 
<BR>
tulip.c ... I replaced it with the newer version that was with 2.0.36 
<BR>
and recompiled... yet, same problem. 
<BR>
<P>The symptoms of the problem are: 
<BR>
when I try to use ipfwadm, I get the error message I got when I used the 
<BR>
default ipfwadm that came with RH 5.2. Which is as if it wasn't compiled 
<BR>
into the kernel... but I check that, I do have the correct options 
<BR>
enabled for IP masquerading.
<BR>
<P>also, my routing table is awkward. Every entry is duplicated. But if I 
<BR>
shutdown all the interfaces (3 of them, eth0,eth1, eth2) and restart 
<BR>
them manually, the routing table is fine.
<BR>
<P>the third problem I think I just figured out... for some odd reason eth0 
<BR>
and eth1 got swapped... they both use the tulip driver. So thats 
<BR>
probably why the I couldn't get out to the net using eth0.... as my net 
<BR>
connection was switched to eth1.
<BR>
<P>Anyways... anyone trying 2.1.131 on Miata,... these are some things to 
<BR>
watch out for... and if anyone knows why ipfwadm isn't working... please 
<BR>
let me know. Thanks!... I heard rumors that I need a new ipfwadm to work 
<BR>
with the newer 2.1.131 kernels... confirm?
<BR>
