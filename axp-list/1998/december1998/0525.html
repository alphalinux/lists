<P><EM>    justinbailey&gt; Hello all.  I am looking to set up my a mail server on my
</EM><BR>
<EM>    justinbailey&gt; as200, serving no more than 5 pop accounts with average
</EM><BR>
<EM>    justinbailey&gt; mail loads, and before I go through the pain of
</EM><BR>
<EM>    justinbailey&gt; configuring sendmail, I wanted to ask all of you how
</EM><BR>
<EM>    justinbailey&gt; qmail compares.  I have heard from some that it's better
</EM><BR>
<EM>    justinbailey&gt; in almost every way (security, speed, ease of
</EM><BR>
<EM>    justinbailey&gt; configuration, etc.)  Is this true?  If so, does anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>    justinbailey&gt; know of better documentation than the mail-HOWTO on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>    justinbailey&gt; LDP?  Again, thanks for sharing your wisdom with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>    justinbailey&gt; relative newbie.
</EM><BR>
<P>For the task your are talking about, I don't think there would be much to
<BR>
choose between sendmail, qmail or exim for that matter. I would use whichever
<BR>
MTA you are most familiar with. The configuration of any of for this task
<BR>
is essentially very simple, but having said that, if you are not familiar
<BR>
with the software that makes these tasks appear more difficult than they
<BR>
are.
<BR>
<P>More than a few people find that they have some problems with getting
<BR>
outgoing mail working for pop accounts attached to a qmail server. This is
<BR>
not because it is difficult (it's actually very straightforward), but
<BR>
because they fail to realise that they need to consider this as
<BR>
&quot;relaying&quot;. (This crops up on the qmail mailing list *all* the time, much
<BR>
to the annoyance of a number of the regulars.)
<BR>
<P>If you go this route with qmail, make sure you also grab Dan Bernstein's
<BR>
tcpserver software as well. 
<BR>
There is plenty of information in the qmail documentation and FAQ to help
<BR>
you set up qmail. There is also a relatively new &quot;Qmail-HOWTO&quot; which you
<BR>
might find useful (<A HREF="http://www.flounder.net/qmail/qmail-howto.html">http://www.flounder.net/qmail/qmail-howto.html</A>).
<BR>
<P>I run qmail here, and on my other machine which is also a small pop
<BR>
server. It works well, but then so did sendmail.
