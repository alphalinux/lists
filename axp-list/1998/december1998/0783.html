<EM>&gt; Er... Well I can't say that I just changed a tire while my car was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doing 140 kph on I95 and all.  You are correct about &quot;shutting down&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the device about to be &quot;unscrewed,&quot; but that doesn't change the fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that your critical chunk of code/data (the kernel) is getting tweaked.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I should point out that I prefer the inconveinence of a kernel compile
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the down time (and overhead) incurred as a result of kernel modules.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course a kernel compile for me takes under 2 minutes on my dual box.

<P>I guess I've just gotten used to several systems that support
<BR>
dynamic device reconfiguration without re-booting. Linux, Solaris,
<BR>
and AIX all allow that. You just have to be careful what you do
<BR>
to keep things in order. I remove/add tape drives all the time
<BR>
as modules and muck with that SCSI chain and it usually works
<BR>
well. Now, of course I run tape drives  on a separate adapter
<BR>
just for that reason. Wouldn't do that on a chain with disks,
<BR>
unless I could close all file systems on the drive before doing
<BR>
anything to it. I've done that sort of thing on AIX though, and been
<BR>
burned only once in the past 8 years.(lost my OS partition due
<BR>
to SCSI errors trashing the file system)
<BR>
<P>For what I do, it's more just configuring external devices than
<BR>
anything else. I don't see much need to do that with devices
<BR>
plugged into the PCI bus because typically you can't hot swap
<BR>
those adapters anyway so you have to power down to do the 
<BR>
change.
<BR>
<P>One improvement I'd like in Linux is a command similar to AIX's 
<BR>
&quot;cfgmgr&quot; which does an automatic rescan for new devices and loads 
<BR>
the needed modules without having to do it manually though. 
<BR>
Basically, similar to how Linux already does things at boot
<BR>
but user invokable at any time. Anyone know if such a thing
<BR>
is available or could be made to work?
