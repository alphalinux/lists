<P>
I got my alpha lpd working again--maybe the following will help a gru figure out what's
<BR>
going on:
<BR>
<P>The first thing I did was search my system for all instances of `lpd'
<BR>
and found the lock file:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;/var/lock/susbsys/lpd
<BR>
<P>I noticed it had the reboot time.  I removed the file.
<BR>
<P>Then I noticed that there were two copies of lpd running--maybe that's
<BR>
why the connect problem:  one was already connected to the /dev/printer.
<BR>
(Actually I believe there will normally be two processes, but only when there is an
<BR>
active job.  I believe the second lpd was somehow left as an orphan
<BR>
and was holding the lock, thus preventing normal operations.)
<BR>
<P>With the lock removed, I again executed
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;/etc/rc.d/init.d/lpd stop
<BR>
<P>which deleted both lpd processes (I may have had to do it twice--
<BR>
I'm not sure and I've not been able to duplicate the dual lpd's again.
<BR>
I suspect that if I had done this twice before, or manually killed all
<BR>
lpd's, I could have gotten a normal restart.)
<BR>
<P>Then I executed:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;/etc/rc.d/init.d/lpd start
<BR>
<P>and
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;lpc restart lp
<BR>
<P>and everthing was up and running fine again.
<BR>
<P>I wish I could give a better description of what was wrong, how
<BR>
to duplicate it, and how to fix it, but at least this fumble worked
<BR>
for me.
<BR>
<P>Good luck.
