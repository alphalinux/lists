Quoting Peter Petrakis &lt;<A HREF="mailto:peterpan@wn.net?subject=Re:%20Re[2]:%20I%20just%20got%20appliware!!%20(review)">peterpan@wn.net</A>&gt;:

<EM>&gt; &lt;snip, A quick overview of my system I installed it on and pros &amp; cons&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; That's great, so now I guess it falls to you to provide this list with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; our first userland review:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     Hardware you installed on?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm running a 533LX , 128 megs, and SCSI drives. It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quite snappy though the real test is when it runs on average hardware.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Did I say it was fast? :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     Strengths of suite - features that standout?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The WP is quite nice, It reminds of worperfect 7 with it's functionality.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It' s really quite powerfull. The Presentation program is quite nice with about equal if not more power than powerpoint and corel presetation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Intuitive and easy to use. The spreadshet is really nice and MUCH easir to use than excel. The only thing I miss is quick fill. To do it in applix you have to go up to the edit menu and select it though it does give some nice options. I'd like to see that in the right click shell or on the tool bar. The graphing functions are really nice. It has a better and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interface than excel and gives you more options in how you want to plot your data and shows you a preview. Lots of functions  and to make a graph you get to drag the space you want it to take up. I like that. The database builder looks nice but I have no kind of experence with it Anyone no of a routine I could try to test it's effectiveness? I like that mail program , it's real slick and convenient. It's like exmh but polished and tons more features.  The HTML editor looks nice , I'll give it a shot tommorrow , try editing my web page which has a lot of tables. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     Weaknesses of suite - this that standout for the wrong reasons?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There's not really any weakness. It's got that motif look which is ok but I like gtk+. It has alot of versital apps which all have a great deal of functionality and integrate real well with each other. With a few minor tweaks it with the spreadsheet UI and maybe some customizable tool bars this suite could be even better. Though when WordPerfect 8 comes out and they have a full featured version you bet your ass I'm getting it :). The rest of the applix suite is kick ass.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for $99 you can't go wrong. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     Compatability with that *other* office suite?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have  abunch of excel wrk sheets that I did in my engineering apps class that'll try importing later and try to do the same problems with applix. The goal seek function looks VERY powerful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; , It even lets you set precision. It could use an excel style solver and a little better placement of the border and shading option ( like a button,  not a sub menu) but thats it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'll provide more detaild info about importing and doing some word, html, and spreadsheet editing tomorrow. Merry Christmas all.
</EM><BR>
<P>Dear Sir,
<BR>
<P>May I humbly suggest that you investigate some of the options
<BR>
in your new favorite mail program with the objective of having
<BR>
it word wrap at least at 80 characters.
<BR>
<P>I know that it is not your mission in life to please those of
<BR>
us who use a standard terminal mail program but it would be nice
<BR>
never the less.
<BR>
<P>Yours in the Linux Revolution...
<BR>
<P>Ray
