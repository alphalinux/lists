<EM>&gt; &gt; I think that there is a problem with your scsi chain.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; -are you sure that you have correctly ended your scsi chain with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; terminator
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OK. This has been one point. The PCI-SC875 has 3 connectors (2 internal,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1 external) and I must not use more than two of them, but my CD-drive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and internal HD drive have been connected to both of the internal connectors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I have tried to connect the second harddisk to the external connector.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now I have disconnected the CD drive but it is not a solution!
</EM><BR>
<P>Buy an internal 68-50 pin adaptor.  They exist.  Don't pay more than 30$
<BR>
for it and that is still steep.  Sorry, the rules of physics is against
<BR>
you on your expectations.
<BR>
<P>The reason so many people have trouble with SCSI is that few people know
<BR>
electromagnetics (or just follow the directions in the first place).  The
<BR>
second internal connector is used to save cost on adaptors.  You CANNOT
<BR>
use all three connectors and expect them to work. My roomate wondered why
<BR>
his SCSI stuff was screwed up.  He ran for years without a terminator at
<BR>
one end.  No terminators cause reflections and
<BR>
harmonics, as does having a three-way bus, as this significantly affects
<BR>
the bandwidth performance of a system,  As this is called 'Stub tuning'
<BR>
meaning that is only done to optimize the analog bandwidth of a
<BR>
transmission line, but done wrong, and you can play havoc with your
<BR>
expectations.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Current situation is now:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; HD drive 0 (id 0) is connected to 68 pin internal connecter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; HD drive 1 (id 1) is connected to 68 pin external connecter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; internal 50 pin connector remains free.
</EM><BR>
<P>2 of three.  ONLY two of three.  Ignore the manuals and rules at your own
<BR>
peril.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And I'm confused by the fact, that BIOS and MILO recognize all disks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; correctly, e.g. I can format disk 1 with a BIOS function.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe BIOS and MILO try lowest frequency possible, kernel pushes it up.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; -are you sure that there isn't too much terminators in your chain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (one at each extremity only)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes
</EM><BR>
<P>If you are using the Ultra speed, active terminators are the best for the
<BR>
task.
