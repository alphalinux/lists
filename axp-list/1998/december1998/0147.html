hello all.  i am install 5.2 on my as200 4/233.
<BR>
i am successfully booting into milo, but i have two problems:
<BR>
1. milo says i have 16M ram, when i actually have 32M (the first set of
<BR>
SIMMs is in bank 0 and the second in bank 2.  does that make any kind of
<BR>
difference?  srm recognized 32M, so i figured it was fine.)
<BR>
2. i can't get my boot disk to work.  i have been working from the various
<BR>
(conflicting) as200-specific directions on alphalinux.org, and i tried two
<BR>
things- a floppy onto which i rawrote avanti.img and a floppy onto which i
<BR>
copied avanti.gz from the kernels directory.  what exactly should i be
<BR>
using?  sometimes i get 'not enough memory' errors, sometimes it says it
<BR>
can't load a file, most recently /milo.conf or /etc/milo.conf or something
<BR>
like that.
<BR>
also, i noticed in the milo startup messages that it thinks my floppy drive
<BR>
is 2.88M.  i remember reading somewhere that you were supposed to set it to
<BR>
1.44M, but i can't seem to remember where i read that or how important it
<BR>
is.
<BR>
any help would be appreciated.
<BR>
<P>thanks in advance.
<BR>
