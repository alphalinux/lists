<P>
I currently have a parallel port ZIP drive, but I promised it to my
<BR>
father, since I also have a SCSI (2) ZIP drive kicking around.  I have an
<BR>
NCR53C875 UW SCSI controller, but its external connector is the 68-pin
<BR>
micropin form factor, and the ZIP SCSI cable is 25-pin on both ends.
<BR>
<P>I found a cable that looks like it *might* work, but it is US$68, which
<BR>
just isn't something I'm going to pay to get a drive working for which I
<BR>
paid US$60 in the first place.  Besides, I'm not sure it'll even work.
<BR>
<P>So, I started looking at Cheaper Than Dirt (TM) Brand ISA SCSI
<BR>
controllers, and of course I found the Iomega &quot;ZIP Zoom&quot; SCSI 2 adapter.
<BR>
This is US$34, which is more in line, and I'd like to pick it up, assuming
<BR>
it'll work in my SX164.  Unfortunately I see no &quot;ZIP Zoom&quot; driver in the
<BR>
kernel source.  So, I have a few questions:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  Does anyone have any experience with this particular adapter,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will it work in my SX164?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  What IS this adapter?  (i.e. does it have drive support under
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a different name?)
<BR>
<P>Now, I asked a similar question once before, and I believe Jay said that
<BR>
in general ISA SCSI cards on Alphae are problematic, so I'm not hopeful,
<BR>
but I figured I'd ask anyway, before I break down and buy another parallel
<BR>
port drive (which I can get cheaper than the cable) and try and unload
<BR>
this SCSI deal.
