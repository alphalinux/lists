I ordered one at the &quot;old&quot; price of $99, but when I ordered they didn't
<BR>
have the internal PCI/SCSI riser card units, just the internal SCSI drive
<BR>
versions... Well, I knew I would want to add a CD ROM drive to my unit
<BR>
(to, um, install the OS), but SCSI interface cards were about $25... For
<BR>
$60 I get another unit, *with* the PCI/SCSI Riser and some spare parts!
<BR>
<P>See below for further responses...

<EM>&gt;Beware.  I have two of the first round machines that have everything

<P>What would a socketed CPU offer you? CPUs are *very* expensive (esp.
<BR>
compared to $59!) and the units they offer now have 256K cache - it
<BR>
could use more, but it is something!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;the faint hearted.  Without a floppy or hard drive you will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;challenged to make them run.  While there is an IDE interface, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;connector is non-standard.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you have a Multia you can move the existing HD into the new &quot;bargain&quot;
<BR>
machine, or net-boot them and run diskless - be sure you have lots of RAM
<BR>
though!
<BR>
<P>The IDE interface is a standard laptop 2 1/2&quot; interface - Maurice has
<BR>
offered these in the past for sale, may still have some... BUT, the IDE
<BR>
performance on these units (IIRC) is not good...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The floppy is a scsi device and I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;think anyone makes SCSI hard drives that fit into these cases.  Sure,
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know about the floppy, I suspect it is a standard laptop drive...
<BR>
<P>As for SCSI drives, you can find them up to about a Gig as Mac Powerbook
<BR>
upgrades (2 1/2&quot; SCSI drives were used in *some* models).  I would
<BR>
*strongly* advise anyone thinking about these units to get the external
<BR>
SCSI/PCI riser card version...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;you can run an external, but the key utility to these machines is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they're self-contained.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is a fair point, but as I said, net-boot is an interesting option!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Since the world is going 100BaseT, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;internal net card may be useless.  For example, I have 100BaseT only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hubs.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is one of the reasons I suggest getting the PCI/SCSI riser card -
<BR>
you can add a $40 100BaseT card!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I also paid much more than 60 corn for mine.
</EM><BR>
<P>I paid a lot more for my first Multia, sold it for about half what I
<BR>
paid, then bought two more recently (out of shear amazement - I happen
<BR>
to have a bit of Parity RAM &amp; HDs I can use to make these run in my 
<BR>
parts bin...)
