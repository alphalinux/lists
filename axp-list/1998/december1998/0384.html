<P>
With regards to your message at 03:59 PM 12-09-98 +0800, Bernard Chew, Lai
<BR>
Wan. Where you stated:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;These take 36 bit SIMMs ( 72 pin, tin lead) in banks of 4 pieces.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;It has ARC or SRM BIOS.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;You also need a power supply with the extra 2 connectors providing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discrete
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;3.3V.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Meaning a standard ATX PC casing &amp; power supply will be suitable ? I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;suppose I will need to do some surgery on the ATX power supply 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;connectors, yes?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Thanks.

No Bernard. These baords are from the AT days, not the more recent ATX.
<BR>
Nothing &quot;standard&quot; about the power supply. It needs to be an AT power
<BR>
supply, with 2 additional 6 pin connectors, providing 3 pins carrying 3.3V
<BR>
and 3 pins carrying ground connection on each of these 2 additional
<BR>
connectors. The power provided is additional to the &quot;normal&quot; 5, 12, -5 and
<BR>
-12V on the &quot;normal&quot; AT power supply. The connectors are often referred to
<BR>
as P9, P10, P11, P12.
<BR>
<P>What happened: In the AT standard, you needed 5,12, -5, -12, and gorund.
<BR>
Then systems came out with CPUs, PCI buses and other devices requiring 3.3
<BR>
V power.
<BR>
To provide this the manufacturers added these 2 new connectors. This was a
<BR>
kind of &quot;transition&quot; design.
<BR>
Then came ATX as a standard, which provides for the 3.3V ( along with a few
<BR>
new features, such as &quot;soft power&quot; control).
<BR>
<P>As for the case: AT design is what you need, with 1 small change: the mouse
<BR>
and keyboard connectors are placed together, in the location where an AT
<BR>
keyboard connector &quot;normally&quot; is on a case. So the hole has to be enlarged
<BR>
a bit. If you have some handtools like a drill, file, and pliers you can do
<BR>
this yourself. It is not complicated.
<BR>
<P>The other thing I think should be mentioned is that these boards do not
<BR>
have a built-in SCSI interface, and as the ARC BIOS on them is a bit older,
<BR>
not many modern SCSI cards will be seen by the BIOS for the purpose of
<BR>
booting. We have had best luck with the Intraserver 3140U-N and 4140UE-N
<BR>
for this purpose. Diamond Fireport40, Buslogic BT958, and Adaptec 2940 did
<BR>
NOT work.
<BR>
