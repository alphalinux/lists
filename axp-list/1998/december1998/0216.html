Hi John,
<BR>
<P>See my response to a response I got to my post. My problem was including 
<BR>
the frame buffer options... once I took them out, the kernel booted just 
<BR>
fine.. in fact, it makes my disk access a LOT faster.... you can 
<BR>
literarly feel the speed without wishful thinking.
<BR>
<P>I don't know if that might be your problem.. but it worked for me. My 
<BR>
only other problem now, is that either my init scripts or something is 
<BR>
too old, and my routing table entries are all duplicated. It doesn't 
<BR>
hinder anything... but just want to fix it.
<BR>
<P>I've had 2.1.131 running as a gateway and workstation 11 hours now.. and 
<BR>
counting... not a single problem yet... but we'll wait and see... I did 
<BR>
find some patchs that Alan Cox released for the 2.1.131 kernel... I 
<BR>
didn't use them, as I didn't know about them when I compiled my kernel.. 
<BR>
until I notice a problem, I probably will put off worrying about those 
<BR>
patches. I'm just happy that 131 is working and my disk access is so 
<BR>
much faster.... 
<BR>
<P>But if the frame buffer exclusion doesn't work for you, perhaps you will 
<BR>
want to try the patches..??
<BR>
<P>Good Luck.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I have exactly the same problem with an LX164, so I get the feeling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;something is a bit broken, although at the moment I can't quite figure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;out what, seeing as it refuses to yield any information at all when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it hangs...I've built it with 3 different compilers and all produce the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;result
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cheers
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt;	&gt;I successfully compiled 2.1.131 but it hangs right after the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;kernel is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	&gt;decompressed and the message &quot;jumping to kernel 2.1.131...&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	&gt;I noticed that if I use make xconfig, I get a lot of Broken
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;config.in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	&gt;messages.... what is wrong here? I avoided that by using make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;config 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	&gt;instead... 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	&gt;Does my compiler have anything to do with it? I'm using the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;default that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	&gt;came with RedHat 5.2, which I think is egcs 1.0.3a .
</EM><BR>
