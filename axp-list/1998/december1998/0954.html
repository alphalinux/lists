<P>
<EM>&gt; Thanks for all the responses.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	Unfortunately, I'm at work, and the Alpha is at home. I'll take a look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at the serial port speed tonight. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; 	Well after this week-ends adventure of installing the 56k external
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; modem,  I just need to do some tuning.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; 	The new modem is working ok, it dials, &amp; maintains a connection, as one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; would expect. But...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; 	When it connects, it's only connecting as a v.34, not a v.90.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; Consequently, I'm only getting 26400 &amp; 28800 connections. Is there some trick
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; to getting it to use v.90?  (again, it's on an AlphaStation 200 4/233 running
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; RedHat 5.1).
</EM><BR>
<P>I work at an ISP with a v.90 modem service.  Although I do not 
<BR>
follow specifically that area, I see all the users calls to technical
<BR>
support and there are quite a few similar to yours.
<BR>
<P>I would tend to say that with a probability &gt;99% your Alpha has nothing 
<BR>
to do with this issue.  This should be a modem protocol negotiation issue, 
<BR>
and the parameters to consider first are: (a) what modem you have
<BR>
(brand, or at least chipset); (b) what modem (or access server
<BR>
with modems inside) your ISP has;  (c) what modem initialization
<BR>
strings are used on both sides. 
<BR>
<P>I would suggest to open a call with your ISP, giving them all
<BR>
the modem information on your side, and listen to what they
<BR>
suggest. At present there are still a lot of interoperability problems
<BR>
in the v.90 world.  You have a good chance (say, 75%) that your
<BR>
problem could be solved by crafting the modem initialization
<BR>
strings.  For the other 25%, you may be running across a genuine
<BR>
modem interoperability problem.  V.90 modem firmware is changing
<BR>
nearly weekly these days.   If your ISP uses an access server
<BR>
with downloadable modem firmware and the currently installed 
<BR>
release is more than one-two months old, updating the modem
<BR>
firmware could solve the problem with no debugging work.
<BR>
<P>In all cases I do not think that discussion on this topic belongs
<BR>
to this list; feel free to email me privately if you wish.
