<EM>&gt;It doesn't hurt to be patient.

<P>I have ordered two, one at the higher price (with floppy), I think it
<BR>
was $99 + S/H, the second one (without floppy, but *with* PCI riser card)
<BR>
for $59 + S/H. The first one came within a week (haven't had a chance to
<BR>
boot it yet), the second one took about two weeks, but it came with an
<BR>
extra battery (I suspect) - it was in the box, not in the Multia case,
<BR>
so I guess by mistake/christmas spirit they included another battery...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;CPUMicromart is selling about 200-500 of these multias a week.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;salesperson I spoke to was very helpful and nice.  They don't have a lot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;info on these machines, because they just picked up about 9000 of them in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;DEC FRU closeout.  So, if you want a Multia cheap, be patient, deal with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the problems and get one.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd agree - the Multia makes sense if you have access to cheap RAM (like
<BR>
in your parts bin) and have an old SCSI drive or can run them diskless...
<BR>
IMHO the cost of RAM is what drives these machines out of consideration -
<BR>
$160 for 64 Meg of RAM (4x$40) in a $59 box is a bit silly, but I guess
<BR>
stranger things happen...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I got two.  They didn't double bill me, the order took 4 days longer than I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was told, but who cares?!  It's the holiday season and I got Multias for $59!
</EM><BR>
<P>All in all, I'm pretty happy with CPUMicroMart myself, but, realize what
<BR>
you are getting!
