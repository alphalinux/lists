<P>
<EM>&gt;The version of the tulip driver that comes in the devel kernels is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stock; there are two code paths on tulip right now (bleah).  One that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Donald does (ie. the latest) and the one in the devel kernels, which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;based on an older driver, but has fast-routing and some other tweaks.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm... so do you suggest to stay with the older drivers???
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; The symptoms of the problem are: 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; when I try to use ipfwadm, I get the error message I got when I used 
</EM><BR>
the 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; default ipfwadm that came with RH 5.2. Which is as if it wasn't 
</EM><BR>
compiled 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ipfwadm is obsolete in the new kernels; you need ipchains.  There is a 
</EM><BR>
good
<BR>
<P>Okay... I'm a moron... I read something from the ip masq resource 
<BR>
website.. and apparently in a very old dev kernel ipfwadm still 
<BR>
worked... then I read about ipchains... and everything works now. Sorry, 
<BR>
user(me) error....
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; also, my routing table is awkward. Every entry is duplicated. But if 
</EM><BR>
I 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; shutdown all the interfaces (3 of them, eth0,eth1, eth2) and restart 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; them manually, the routing table is fine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Two things to check here; make sure you have the latest init scripts 
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt;the latest net-tools.  Network interfaces were changed in many ways in 
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;2.1 kernel.  I think there is documentation on this in the kernel, as 
</EM><BR>
well.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;I think the specific issue you're dealing with is that routes are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;automatically assigned on interface configuration now.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm guessin that the init scripts and net-tools that come with RH5.2 are 
<BR>
not the latest for 2.1.x kernels? If so, where can I get them? Please 
<BR>
give me a pointer....
<BR>
<P>Although, the awkward routing table is still there at the moment, it 
<BR>
works... so I'm not too worried about it... but if fixable, that's 
<BR>
always better...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; the third problem I think I just figured out... for some odd reason 
</EM><BR>
eth0 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; and eth1 got swapped... they both use the tulip driver. So thats 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; probably why the I couldn't get out to the net using eth0.... as my 
</EM><BR>
net 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; connection was switched to eth1.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That's odd... not one I've heard of.  Which console do you use?  The 
</EM><BR>
tulip
<BR>
<EM>&gt;driver works by iterating through the PCI BIOS in search of successive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;devices matching the class/devid.  If it's a problem for you, there is 
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt;#define in the tulip.c driver that can be set for reverse detection.  
</EM><BR>
This
<BR>
<EM>&gt;would at least allow you to keep the same interface names across 
</EM><BR>
2.0/2.1
<BR>
<EM>&gt;boots.  BTW, you might want to try the de4x5 driver as well.
</EM><BR>
<P>well... actually, it makes more sense the way it detects the NICs now... 
<BR>
let me describe:
<BR>
<P>Onboard Ethernet DC21142 (is eth0 when alone, eth1 with another NIC with 
<BR>
kernel 2.0.x)
<BR>
<P>Add-on Ethernet DC21140 (is eth0 with 2.0.x kernel, eth1 now with 
<BR>
2.1.131)
<BR>
<P>Add-on Ethernet 3c905 (this has always been eth2)
<BR>
<P>I never understood why all of a sudden eth0 became eth1 when I added 
<BR>
another NIC... but the way it is detected now makes more sense... 
<BR>
anyways.. it's not really an issue.. I just swapped the ifcfg-ethX 
<BR>
files.... and now it works.. .i'm writing this on a NT machine behind 
<BR>
the Alpha with 2.1.131 and ipchains...
<BR>
