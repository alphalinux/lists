<EM>&gt;ok i downloaded 2.0.35 but do you suggest to go on with the experimental
</EM><BR>
kernels ?
<BR>
<EM>&gt; i haven't had much experience with that....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should i upgrade the libs and the rest as well than or would a patch be a
</EM><BR>
solution.?
<BR>
<P>Well I'd give 2.0.35 a go - 2.2. should land in a month or so and with any
<BR>
luck things
<BR>
will become easier.  I haven't had enough experience of the 2.0's on Alpha
<BR>
to say whether
<BR>
you should move or not; I've been using 2.1's for most of the time - I
<BR>
presently
<BR>
have 2.1.130 on my system and its solid as a rock; I think my serial port
<BR>
is running at either
<BR>
56K or 115.2K to my modem.

<P>P.S. I've realised I've had my Alpha for just over a year now - how time
<BR>
flies when you have a fast machine! Its nice to see how much more stable
<BR>
Linux/Alpha, its compilers etc have become in the last year.
