<P>
Thanks for the quick respons,
<BR>
<P>but minicom isn't working as well, it hangs during initialisation. 
<BR>
echo atz &gt; /dev/cua1 just gives one blimp and then nothing, als atdt555 or something like that just gives one blimp
<BR>
You are right about the interrupt, i started minicom and then looked at the /proc/interrupts and its there on irq3 (cua1,com2)
<BR>
But minicom still hangs with just a blinking prompt, not able to type any commands, i can quit minicom however so its not crashed
<BR>

<EM>&gt;I am having problems on 3 linuxboxes with the serial communication. I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can't get none of them to work with a modem. The problem is somewhere in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the serial port setup. when booting it finds the two serial ports but 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;when i look in /proc/interrupts i can't find them back. /proc/ioports 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;does give them
</EM><BR>
<P>Are you sure it always shows them in interrupts? I just have this vague
<BR>
recollection
<BR>
that serial interrupts only show up when you have them open.
<BR>
<P>I suggest you take a really simple terminal program (e.g. Minicom) to it
<BR>
and see if
<BR>
it sees anything of the modem;
