<EM>&gt; It isn't an *official* kernel??  Then why is it being offered for

<EM>&gt; download?

<P>Because, as Jay patiently explained for an umpteenth time and even
<BR>
listed assorted reasons, an &quot;official&quot; 2.0.x kernel - without patching -
<BR>
does not work on Alpha.  This situation is different for 2.1.yyy
<BR>
development kernels and so therefore you will not need any extra
<BR>
patches when 2.2. series finally will show up.
<BR>
<P>If you think that you are satisfied with an *official* 2.0.x kernel
<BR>
then there is nobody who could try to prevent you from trying to run it
<BR>
on Alpha.  Go ahead and be happy.
<BR>
<P>BTW - I mailed to Jay a set of alpha patches for 2.0.36.  They &quot;carry
<BR>
over&quot; to 2.0.36 a set of his patches for 2.0.35 - the latest patch set
<BR>
which I had on hand.  As a matter of fact it is pretty trivial to perform
<BR>
such update &quot;feat&quot;.  You will get a few rejects which has to be resolved
<BR>
&quot;by hand&quot; (updates to tulip.c and de4x5.c are already included in 2.0.36
<BR>
so you do not have to worry about these).  I do not want to post these
<BR>
patches on my own as Jay, in the meantime, may had some other changes
<BR>
and it is enough of &quot;alpha-patches&quot; and associated confusion floating
<BR>
around already.  Maybe he will find some time to review them and to post
<BR>
them &quot;alpha-officially&quot;. :-)
