<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Sheesh, 60 bucks. I don't even need one and I ordered two :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Good!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Beware.  I have two of the first round machines that have everything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in them except for socketed CPU and cache.  These machines are not for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the faint hearted.  Without a floppy or hard drive you will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; challenged to make them run.  While there is an IDE interface, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connector is non-standard.
</EM><BR>
<P>Standard connector, just less commonly used size.  A decent hardware
<BR>
hacker can make one of anylength by ordering 2mm 44 pin connectors and 1mm
<BR>
ribbon cable from Digikey - this would be used for the laptop drives.  As
<BR>
for size adaptors, I've seen adaptors for 8$ at a local computer show.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The floppy is a scsi device
</EM><BR>
<P>Since WHEN?  That sure isn't a standard SCSI connector, and even so, it
<BR>
doesn't show up on SCSI chain diagnostics.  It is a normal floppy.  I've
<BR>
seen other floppies with that kind of a connector.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;and I don't think anyone makes SCSI hard drives that fit into these
</EM><BR>
cases.
<BR>
<P>That just depends on the riser card &amp; bracket availability, but they
<BR>
advertise one that can fit a 3.5&quot; drive.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; they're self-contained.  Since the world is going 100BaseT, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; internal net card may be useless.  For example, I have 100BaseT only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hubs.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm. I picked up a 16$ DE435 PCI NIC new-old-stock just so that my MIATA
<BR>
can communicate to the Multia using coax.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I also paid much more than 60 corn for mine.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oops.  These machines are nifty, but I don't consider it to be usable as a
<BR>
primary machine unless you only now have a 486.  Usable as an Xterm
<BR>
oh yeah.
<BR>
<P>JRDM
