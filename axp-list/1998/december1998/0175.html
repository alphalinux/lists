<P>
<EM>&gt;Just thought I'd let the list know: I picked up a videoblaster riva based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;card last night to try in my machine, an as200. The card won't even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;initialize in it. I'm going to return in and try one of the ati cards. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'll keep you guys posted on what does and doesn't work in these machines.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<P><P>Hi,
<BR>
<P>Now XFree86 3.3.3 was released and new supprot for the Riva 128 based
<BR>
carsds was added I tried to install the Diamond Viper V330 in my 
<BR>
Alphastation 255.. Well it DIDN't work. Sadly enough.
<BR>
<P>I updated the BIOS to 1.62.. Didn;t help much.. It's good I could sell the
<BR>
card immediately.
<BR>
<P>Anybody want to make a list of working adapters. ?
<BR>
<P>I don;t have webspace that's [ermanently on-line.. But am willing
<BR>
to create and maintain pages about working graphics adapters !
<BR>
<P>Rick
