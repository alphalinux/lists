<p>
Ok, I was going to wait with this until I finished, but I have run into<br>
some problems, so I thought I'd tell you all what to expect of the 164SX's<br>
EIDE controller even though my driver for it isn't finished yet.<br>
<p>
First of all, the 164SX doesn't use the CMD64x chipset at all. That means<br>
that my work probably will be of no use for the PC164 which people seem to<br>
be talking about under this subject :/<br>
<p>
Instead, the 164SX uses the Cypress CY82C693U chip. I have not checked<br>
whether the 164LX uses the same chipset, but I think it does. For some<br>
reason this chipset is detected as "Contaq" with the same numbers:<br>
<p>
ajo@ymer ~ &gt;cat /proc/pci <br>
PCI devices found:<br>
[...]<br>
  Bus  0, device   8, function  2:<br>
    IDE interface: Contaq 82C693 (rev 0).<br>
      Medium devsel.  Fast back-to-back capable.  Master Capable.  No<br>
bursts.  <br>
      I/O at 0x170.<br>
      I/O at 0x374.<br>
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0x28a0000.<br>
[...]<br>
<p>
Now, one day I got tired of my IDE driver taking ~100% cpu at the blazing<br>
transfer rate of 1.2MB/s, so I decided to do something about it. Now, I<br>
seemed to remeber that the Cypress device was quite similar to the Intel<br>
devices, so I checked my Cypress documentation against the triton.c DMA<br>
ide driver.  And yes, the dma interface works the same way, but one needs<br>
to set up some pci registers an other way with the Cypress device, mainly<br>
for mapping the dma registers in io space.<br>
<p>
I solved this very quickly, and now I have quite decent transfer speed and<br>
cpu percentage to my IBM Ultrastar 6.4GB drive (these figures are while<br>
doing multiple mode DMA transfers mode 2):<br>
<p>
Mar 26 22:48:45 ymer kernel: hdc: IBM-DHEA-36480, 6197MB w/476kB Cache,<br>
CHS=12592/16/63, DMA<br>
<p>
ajo@ymer /home/ajo #time dd if=/dev/hdc of=/dev/null bs=65536 count=4096<br>
4096+0 records in<br>
4096+0 records out<br>
0.013u 3.117s 0:39.88 7.8%      0+0k 0+0io 73pf+0w<br>
ajo@ymer /home/ajo #expr 65536 "*" 4096 / 40<br>
6710886<br>
<p>
This test was done several times and I only have 128MB ram, so none of<br>
the data was read from the cache.<br>
<p>
My drive can actually do Ultra-ATA, but I haven't tried it with a<br>
motherboard that supports this mode, so I don't know if I have hit the<br>
limit of the drive. This might very well be the case, though.<br>
<p>
I could easily make a working driver now, but I ran into another problem.<br>
While doing large transfers from the IDE-drive I noticed a problem with my<br>
DMA-using sound card.   It actually can't play sound at the desired rate!<br>
It seems the Cypress device never ever detaches from the pci bus while<br>
doing dma transfers (and these can be up to 64k large). This happens even<br>
if the transfer is divided in several smaller transfers via a transfer<br>
descriptor table. I have never heard of this problem with the triton<br>
chipset.<br>
<p>
Then I tried setting the Cypress chip for using single mode transfer<br>
(detach from the pci bus after each 32 bit transfer). This solved the<br>
sound card problem, but in this mode the transfer rate stinks.<br>
<p>
So my plan now is to make larger changes to the driver which will indeed<br>
split up the transfers for real so that my soundcard may get enough pci<br>
cycles for sound play. I'll post a patch for the kernel once I'm finished<br>
with my dma driver for the Contaq chip, so stay tuned folks!<br>
<p>
Any comments are naturally welcome.<br>
