Anyone want to donate a something-faster-than-a-UDB over here?  Grr...<br>

Johan:  I'm glad you got that to compile.  I *finally* got MySQL to run<br>
through configure, but now it complains that it wants a newer version of<br>
Perl.  Do you think I could convince you to create a RPM of Perl5.004 for<br>
me?  Pleeeeease?<br>
<p>
And for the one person who asked me about MySQL:  It *just* finished going<br>
though configure, I can't guarantee past that, but here's what has to<br>
happen:<br>
<p>
First:  Ignore what the MySQL documentation says.  It lies.  However, it<br>
is close.  DO get the package it recommends.  DO NOT try to get it<br>
directly.  It has moved to: <a href="ftp://www.tcx.se/pub/mysql/Downloads/Linux">ftp://www.tcx.se/pub/mysql/Downloads/Linux</a>.<br>
DO NOT try to get it from the US mirror ftp.mysql.net - there are no files<br>
there whatsoever.  DO NOT download glibc - this isn't even needed.  DO NOT<br>
download linuxthreads - they won't work without glibc, and you DID NOT<br>
get that.  Untar the package you downloaded.  DO NOT believe the readme.<br>
There is libpthread.a, and that is good.  There is libpthread.so, and that<br>
is BAD.  It is an Intel binary.  DO this:<br>
<p>
# cd /lib<br>
# mv libpthread-0.5.so libpthread.-0.5.so.orig<br>
# rm -f libpthread.so.0<br>
# cd /usr/lib<br>
# mv libpthread.a libpthread.a.orig<br>
# cp &lt;untardir&gt;/libpthread.a .<br>
<p>
Then run configure.  This is as far as I've gotten.<br>
<p>
Also, I have compiled and installed an EGCS snapshot:<br>
<p>
$ which gcc<br>
/usr/local/bin/gcc<br>
$ gcc --version<br>
egcs-2.91.13 980308 (gcc-2.8.0 release)<br>
<p>
It COULD NOT compile glibc 2.06, it would always seg fault in the sunrpc<br>
directory (actually, it was the linker that was segfaulting - I read that<br>
I could use a different linker, I may have needed a newer binutils, but<br>
that's nothing I wanted to go through right now).  However, it seems to be<br>
compiling everything else alright, so far.  Of course, I don't use C++ so<br>
I can't testify to that, nor have I done any performance tests, but it<br>
seems to make larger binary files.  What that tells me I have no idea, but<br>
then again, I don't even know if that is true.  Oh - there was a problem<br>
with it - it had an undefined reference to "HZ".  I #defined HZ to be 1024<br>
(as per the standard header files) and it finished alright (once I got<br>
past the RLIMIT_CPU... stuff). <br>
<p>
And as the MySQL compilation dies, I'll keep everyone informed ... hmm,<br>
"storage size of `org' isn't known".  Great.  I just *love* these ones...<br>
