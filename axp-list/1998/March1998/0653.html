Hellos,<br>
<p>
Yesterday I downloaded the latest SAMBA source via Lynx (there was no RPM<br>
for Alpha RedHat 4.2, just 5.0) and I think that is when I noticed it - my<br>
system load started to grow, and never stopped.  It eventually went to<br>
around 35 (yes, thirty-five) before I rebooted the machine.  The wierd<br>
part was that trying to copy a file resulted in a hang.  I was in X at the<br>
time (standard Fvwm'95) and the xterm would simply not respond.  It did<br>
not matter if I did the copy as myself or as root, both would hang, but I<br>
could open new xterms, memory swap didn't seem to be affected, and I could<br>
navigate the directory tree.  There were NO processes consuming more than<br>
about 12% of CPU, and that was typically X/Top screen updates.  I did not<br>
try to untar the file or do any other sort of disk activity (aside from<br>
the copy).  The problem seemed to be trying to copy across a partition - I<br>
was able to 'mv' the file from /tmp into / (though after the hard reboot<br>
it went back into /tmp with its original name).  Oh yeah, I couldn't<br>
reboot, either.  I tried "reboot", "shutdown -r now", "shutdown now",<br>
"init 0", and "init 5", all with no effect besides a broadcast message. <br>
Attempting to remount the filesystems read only gave me an error about not<br>
being able to create /etc/mtab~.  There was nothing in the logs, either. <br>
Any ideas?  This is a 166 UDB w/64MB RAM, 32MB of which is recognized, and<br>
an IBM 4GB SCSI in an external case, running Kernel 3.0.33 with<br>
Alpha-patches and firewalling. <br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
Christopher.<br>
<p>
And PS:  Still trying to get NetPBM or PBMPlus for this box.  I really<br>
only need pnm2gif and pnmscale if anyone has them handy... <br>
