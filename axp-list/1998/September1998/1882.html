First off, I'd like to wish a hearty Thank-You to all the members of this<br>
list, and especially the ones listed in the addresses of this message.  I'm<br>
sorry if I forgot anyone in specific.<br>
<p>
This has been the most valuable resource I could ever find.  Most lists are<br>
just a lot of people posting questions and not a whole lot of answers.  I<br>
have to say this list is definitely an exception to the rule.<br>
<p>
**For anyone out there with an Avanti Alpha and kernel questions, feel free<br>
to direct them to me.**  I feel like a regular scholarly source on the<br>
subject after all that I've done.  Here's a breakdown if anyone's<br>
interested.<br>
<p>
-Installed RH 5.1 from scratch on an Avanti Alpha workstation 233.<br>
-Need to update kernel to allow for Firewalling<br>
-Tried 10 different kernels. 2.0.xx and 2.1.xxx, would not compile<br>
-Commented out SRM=1 in the top-level Makefile<br>
-Still would not compile kernels.  Weird compile errors.<br>
-Decided to upgrade egcs (gcc in my case)<br>
-Got egcs-1_0_3a.tar.gz and would not compile<br>
-Found out that I had to make config, and then make dep to get egcs to<br>
compile<br>
-Did that, then made egcs.  BTW, egcs -version still shows old version,<br>
     gcc -v shows egcs-1.0.3 release. (whew)<br>
-Rebooted so the Alpha gods would not be upset<br>
-Started compile of linux-2.1.124.tar.gz from scratch<br>
-Went to the machine next day and it was finished compiling with no errors<br>
-Copied vmlinux.gz to boot floppy and booted from MILO<br>
-IT WORKED!!!<br>
<p>
<p>
I couldn't have done this without everyone's help.  I'm still going to have<br>
to get the added NIC to work and configure a firewall, but at least I have<br>
the kernel support to do it now.  (so what if it took me 1 week to get it<br>
there...)<br>
<p>
Thank you all once again.  I'm definitely going to hang around on this list,<br>
so maybe I can offer a little insight to someone in a similar situation that<br>
I was in.<br>
<p>
Maybe, just maybe this alpha isn't as bad as I thought it was...<br>
<p>
<p>
Thanks everybody,<br>
<p>
Steve<br>
