Linux Gets Application Boost<br>
by Chris Oakes <br>
<p>
12:40 p.m.  24.Sep.98.PDT<br>
In a move that could help the Linux OS challenge to Microsoft's Windows<br>
platform, a California company has developed a full-blown Linux-based<br>
applications suite. <br>
<p>
Oakland-based S.u.S.E has released Linux Office Suite 99, which bundles a<br>
popular set of bread-and-butter business applications with S.u.S.E.'s own<br>
version of the Linux OS. The suite ties in Web browsing, authoring,<br>
database, and fax operations. This, says the company, makes for a more<br>
complete package than the three leading Linux application products on the<br>
market -- Applixware, Star Office, and Corel's WordPerfect word processor. <br>
<p>
"It's a more robust office pack than you typically see on the Linux market,"<br>
said Scott Winterton, regional director of sales for S.u.S.E. <br>
<p>
Linux is a Unix-like operating system freely distributed and developed by<br>
volunteer programmers worldwide. Linux has been a marquee success story for<br>
the open development and distribution model. <br>
<p>
The success of Linux development was cited by Netscape as part of its<br>
decision to release its source code for the Communicator browser. <br>
<p>
But to fortify the operating system's future in the business world, the<br>
alterna-OS needs to take on commercial Unix and Windows and get corporate<br>
software buyers to see a free operating system as useful and trustworthy.<br>
High-performance mainstream business applications like Linux Office Suite 99<br>
could help bolster that position. <br>
<p>
The inclusion of Applixware, a leading Linux office suite brings to the mix<br>
spreadsheet, word-processing, presentation, HTML-authoring, and database<br>
functions. An additional filter lets users swap documents in Microsoft<br>
Office 97 format. <br>
<p>
Winterton said the release of his product helps IT managers on the fence<br>
make the jump off the Windows ship because of three factors: cost,<br>
stability, and performance. He says the price -- US$79.95 -- for an OS plus<br>
a complete set of productivity applications well undercuts Microsoft offerings. <br>
<p>
But just as attractive to corporations will be the stability and efficiency<br>
of Linux and its applications. "The Linux OS seldom crashes, if ever," he<br>
said. "I know I've never seen it crash." Also, Linux can prove a more<br>
efficient use of the operating system. Running a 486 still gets the same<br>
kind of performance as a low-end Pentium system, he said. <br>
<p>
Yet Winterton doesn't think Microsoft really recognizes Linux as a challenge<br>
yet. "That's essentially because people so far have been creatures of<br>
habit.... [Microsoft doesn't see] why people would change. But our challenge<br>
to Microsoft is a superior product and a lower-cost product." <br>
<p>
Microsoft representatives could not be reached in time for comment. <br>
<p>
An emerging market <br>
<p>
Corel, now the owner and developer of the long-time PC word-processing<br>
application WordPerfect, has released Linux versions of that application and<br>
is at work on a full Linux Office suite itself. <br>
<p>
The company's communications manager Oliver Bendzsa says Linux is an<br>
emerging market, one that Corel sees as well worth the investment. "We've<br>
found that the market is at a point in time -- the growth of the market and<br>
the acceptance of Linux in the industry -- that there is an opportunity to<br>
further enhance product offerings on the software side." <br>
<p>
The Corel Computer division is also developing a Linux-based<br>
thin-client/thin-server network-computer product line called Netwinder, a<br>
second prong into the Linux marketplace for the company. <br>
<p>
For that product, Bendzsa says Linux is "the right underlying OS because of<br>
its stability and robustness, its technical excellence. On a marketing level<br>
it's exciting because it's well timed. The market is ready to accept viable<br>
alternatives, and so Linux is helping us gain credibility." <br>

I just love reading these Linux vs MS stories.:-{)<br>
