Hi,<br>
<p>
i am having the exact same problem, with an IBM Scsi drive, the system<br>
formats the<br>
swap file perfectly and then it either hangs while it crates the ext2<br>
partion or it<br>
dies on copying the files of the glibc files.......<br>
I bought my AS200 from onsale, is there any body else who had problems like<br>
that ??<br>
On the otherhand my milo problem was due to the graphic card problem, once i<br>
exchanged the digital video card based on the s3 chip, against an matrox it<br>
came up without a problem.... which i think is very wired..........<br>
<p>
any tips what i can do to get this system up and running ????<br>
<p>
Alex<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; I had a problem with a Conner 1060 SCSI HDD some while ago. Maybe the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; following message from Conner Technical Support helps:</i><br>
<p>
Well, I went home and tried out a different drive, a Quantum 2.1gig SCSI<br>
drive, and the problem persisted.  I even mooched an internal CD and set up<br>
everything on the internal chain to make sure there was not a weird<br>
termination issues.  It didn't work.   Lastly, I installed ONLY the hard<br>
drive and did an FTP install - once again it froze right up in the same<br>
place.. BUT...<br>
<p>
The weird thing is that it will always format the SWAP partition!  Its only<br>
after doing the swap that it freezes up.  And, like I said, it seems to be<br>
random.  Sometimes it dies formatting the ext2 partition, sometimes it<br>
succeeds.  At the very best, it dies on glibc-?-0.27.<br>
<p>
I've tried 3 hard drives, 2 cd's, 2 different SCSI ribbon cables, various<br>
termination methods, and its all the same.<br>
<p>
I am wondering now if I have a flakey AS200.  I don't know what to do to<br>
determine this, though, since I can't install ANY OS at all at this point.<br>
<p>
It seems like SCSI weirdness on the AS200 is a well known problem - for<br>
example the NetBSD home page lists it as a known bug.  I have seen it<br>
mentioned elsewhere.  YET it remains on the supported lists of all of these<br>
operating systems..  I'm begining to wonder, also begining to be bummed<br>
that I payed money for an OS I can't install.. :(<br>
