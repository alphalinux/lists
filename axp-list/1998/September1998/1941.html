<i>&gt; The SB Pro works, however, there is a significant hang whenever</i><br>
<i>&gt; disconnecting or connecting to the device, as if interrupts are disabled for</i><br>
<i>&gt; a few seconds to do the disconnect.  (Disconnect shouldn't take this</i><br>
<i>&gt; long...and I'll look at the SB code prolly this weekend).</i><br>
<p>
How long are these "hangs"?  I get about a 100ms or so delay, which is pretty<br>
trivial (and also, the same sort of delay has always been present for audio<br>
on ANY platform that I've ever worked with, so I think that's just load time<br>
for the audio).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; All the sound I've been playing is through mpg123 though, which *DOESN'T*</i><br>
<i>&gt; used mmap().  It's supposed to, but fails somehow, and I haven't figured out</i><br>
<i>&gt; why yet.</i><br>
<p>
Hmm.... my problem exists if I'm using mpg123, play [from the OSS package], <br>
mikmod, gmod, xpe, whatever.  If it uses /dev/dsp or /dev/sequencer, it croaks.<br>
<p>
The oddest part is, it's not the app itself that falls over.  Granted, it <br>
usually does, but yesterday, I wrote a quick little shell script (at my <br>
prompt) to play a sequence of WAV files... after the Eterm which had the <br>
script running, a few other Eterms, my mixer, and my X server all fell over,<br>
the audio was *still playing*, and the script didn't end until it finished <br>
playing all of the audio.  The 'play' process was running in unpriveleged user<br>
space (yeah, I know... /dev/dsp is world writeable.  I was testing. =P), so <br>
there really shouldn't have been any way for it to cause OTHER programs to <br>
segfault unless it's mucking with kernel memory.  That's what's pointing me at<br>
the OSS driver.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Is the AWE64 Gold an ISA or PCI Card?  I suspect some problems with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; IRQ/DMA code, or possibly some problem in initializing the PCI/ISA bridge.</i><br>
<p>
It's ISA... the PCI/ISA initialization stuff sounds interesting... but I don't<br>
think it's related to my problem... though it might be...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I also get low (400k/s max) rates with my PCI 3Com ethernet card, while</i><br>
<i>&gt; nearby Intel boxes can get 1M/s on the same network.  Possibly this is</i><br>
<i>&gt; related?</i><br>
<p>
I haven't had any network problems at all... I get consistently higher transfer<br>
rates than all of my Intel bound friends on my network segment.  I'm only <br>
running a 3c900 Boomerang in one of my 64 bit PCI slots, and it works fine, <br>
though I haven't tried it in a 32 bit slot yet.  Have you tried moving it <br>
around?  I don't think it should make a difference, but it might.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
<p>
