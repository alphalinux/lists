<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; Warren Davies said:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; go get the latest MILO image. I had that problem with my Miata. After I</i><br>
<i>&gt; got the latest it worked fine. BTW there are two areas you can get it from</i><br>
<i>&gt; at gatekeeper. One is the released and one is not but the latest</i><br>
<i>&gt; development one. Don't ask me which dirs cuz I don't remember. I do</i><br>
<i>&gt; remember that I used the development one.</i><br>
<p>
The old MILO directory, unmaintained and not updated for more than a year,<br>
is located at:<br>
<p>
	gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/Miniloader<br>
<p>
Still useful in there is the documentation/HOWTO, though sadly out of date.<br>
<p>
The most recent MILOs have been kept at:<br>
<p>
	gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/Kernels<br>
<p>
and typically produced on a "onesy" basis, as needed, for things that were<br>
broken or the inclusion of newer drivers, etc. Lately, they've been named<br>
something like "milo-lx164-980809" or some such, to indicate the machine that<br>
they are for (in this case LX164) and the date I put them out there. And doing<br>
an "ls -lt" on that directory will also give you some indication as to newness.<br>
<p>
For the RH 5.1 release, I made MILOs available for all platforms at:<br>
<p>
	gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/Kernels/Test-Milos-2.0.30+<br>
<p>
They are still there, but have recently (:-) been joined by a completely<br>
new set, located at:<br>
<p>
	gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/Kernels/Test-Milos-981008<br>
<p>
These "new" ones are the same-old-same-old, and not based on any of the<br>
nifty new enhancements that the Debian folk have been producing. They, like<br>
before, include the DEC BIOS emulation code, and were built under RH 4.2.<br>
<p>
However, there have been some enhancements and updates in various areas;<br>
the ncr53c8xx driver is now at rev 3.0i, and tulip.c at 0.89H. PCI probing<br>
code has been updated to handle new PCI-PCI bridges, especially for some<br>
of the 4-port NIC cards now appearing.<br>
<p>
The kernel code which these MILOs use is an alpha-patched 2.0.35 plus a<br>
couple of little pre36-based tweaks. I will be making these patches available<br>
in the usual place and the usual form within the next day or so.<br>
<p>
If there is a real need for the MILO sources I used, I can make them available<br>
as well; but be aware, the Debian folk were given almost exactly the same code<br>
I used, and it's nearly a sure bet that their setup is easier to duplicate, and<br>
build with.<br>
<p>
I have every intention of cooperating with and encouraging the Debian MILO<br>
effort, if for no other reason than a selfish one: they seem to have a lot<br>
more time and energy and good ideas to bring to continuing MILO development<br>
than I do... ;-}<br>
<p>
So, please, take a look on gatekeeper, grab the latest MILO for your box<br>
from that Kernels/Test-Milos-981008/ directory, and test it out, and let me<br>
know if you run into any problems.<br>
<p>
Thanks!<br>
