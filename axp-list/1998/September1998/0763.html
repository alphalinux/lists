Hi Wes.  I've been following debian-alpha too...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1. They hate RH. Several members of the list, to put it mildly,</i><br>

<p>
Most lists have a few folks like that.  There's also some guys on <br>
debian-alpha who are very capable and trying hard to put together a <br>
quality distribution.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2. They have as many, if not more problems with their distribution.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    I see nothing to indicate it is done better than RH. They hide</i><br>
<i>&gt;    behind the word "beta" to rationalize the amount of updating</i><br>
<i>&gt;    done to their distribution and fault RH for having to update</i><br>
<i>&gt;    things "too much".</i><br>
<p>
Sure, they have some known problems.  RH has too, as they have admitted <br>
on this list.  At least RH has committed to improved quality.  Debian <br>
meanwhile has simply refused to release their Alpha port until they think <br>
it is ready.  We'll have to wait to see the outcome of both...<br>
<p>
I don't see anything wrong with Debian remaining at beta status.  It's <br>
the choice of the maintainer to decide when it is ready for release.  <br>
Both Debian and RH are affected to some degree by the stability of egcs <br>
and glibc, neither of which are maintained by RH or Debian.<br>
<p>
It's been a bumpy road for Alpha users, but as glibc and egcs mature, and <br>
once Linux 2.2 is released, I think both distributions will stabilize.  <br>
And once we have stable distributions, commercial software will follow <br>
(like Metro-X and Applixware for instance).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3. I don't consider RH that great of a distribution either so</i><br>
<i>&gt;    my view on both is not all roses. </i><br>
<p>
I don't blame RH, although they tend towards quick releases.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 4. I prefer the way discussions go on the RH mailing list</i><br>
<i>&gt;    (most of the time) compared to the Debian list. I'd suggest</i><br>
<i>&gt;    you subscribe to both lists and see which one you prefer.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    The people on the list are the ones you'll be dealing list</i><br>
<i>&gt;    for info/help.</i><br>
<p>
axp-list has a lot more general discussion.  The debian-alpha list is <br>
still mostly Debian-specific issues.<br>
<p>
Personally I defected to Debian two weeks ago (although I still have RH <br>
4.2 on disk and occaisionally need it when I can't recompile a program).  <br>
I like their distribution because the folks maintaining it use it every <br>
day (some have been using it over 12 months now) and are self-motivated to <br>
fix bugs and refine the distribution.<br>
<p>
Redhat on the other hand sells a distribution based on Linux/Intel.  They <br>
have expanded into the Sparc and Alpha markets, but unlike the <br>
maintainers at debian-alpha it doesn't seem to be their primary focus <br>
(someone please correct me if I am wrong).<br>
<p>
I didn't find Debian to be riddled with bugs.  My experience may have <br>
been different than yours.  Beyond the usual installation glitches (those <br>
are unfortunately the enduring problems, since the core maintainers <br>
aren't reinstalling every day) my system has been running flawlessly.  <br>
Debian is the first I've seen that didn't install everything on my 164SX <br>
in the year 2018, because the hwclock program correctly detected my <br>
real-time clock.  So far the networking and X11 utilities are working, <br>
and I haven't yet experienced the syslogd problem (but maybe I am just <br>
lucky).  I get the feeling that all of the main packages have been tested <br>
by someone.  I didn't get that with RH 5.1.<br>
