Scott,<br>
<p>
	This is exactly what I am trying to do at my site. I am new to the <br>
Alpha world myself and was surprised at the lack of a cental site, so I decided <br>
to set one up. I am not trying to be specific to any distribution, though I<br>
have found so far that there is more RedHat info floating around than Debian,<br>
no doubt because RedHat's Alpha has been around longer (Right ?).<br>
If you have a list of sites to add then please send it to me. I'm setting this<br>
up for the good off the Alpha community. I realize that it is not<br>
'all-encompassing' at the moment, but I'm willing to take the time to<br>
make it so. Any help you can provide is more than welcome. The<br>
site is currently part off my home ISP account, though I think before long<br>
I'll move it to its own domain (www.alphalinux.org anyone??).<br>
<p>
Feel free to contact me a <a href="mailto:rdp@cheshire.net">rdp@cheshire.net</a> if you'd like to move<br>
this discussion off the list. Thanks. rdp<br>

My apologies to those that get this twice.  Is anybody else concerned that<br>
there may be too many miscellaneous web sites without a central alpha<br>
linux reference site?  Yeah, I know we have the azstarnet axp site, but it<br>
is a bit outdated, especially the links.  There are a great many sites<br>
that are extremely helpful, but are not listed.  Even a site with links to<br>
others, including a brief summary of the content would be helpful.  I may<br>
regret this, but if I volunteer to build the "all-encompassing" site, will<br>
the various maintainers of their own sites agree to submit URL's and<br>
summaries?  For that matter, anybody with a list of sites would also be<br>
welcome to submit.  It would not be distribution-centric, with the<br>
exception of grouping by distribution on the page itself.  I suppose<br>
including companies that provide alphas as well as certain alpha projects<br>
would also be in order.  Comments or suggestions? <br>
