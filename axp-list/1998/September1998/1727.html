The PAS can use up to three IRQs - one for the PAS, one for the SB, and<br>
one for the onboard SCSI.  I/O port usage is probably similarly high.<br>
<p>

<p>
This is not true.  It has the MV chip, AND a SB chip on it - no emulation<br>
involved.  But it's only an 8 bit SB chip - not 16.  The 16 was<br>
considerably more expensive when this board was released.<br>
<p>

<p>
If you bought the MIDI adaptor (not standard) and chose to use the game<br>
port.  The game port is going to use I/O ports anyway, whether it's on<br>
this board or not.<br>
<p>

<p>
The PAS is an awesome card and I still use it today.  Not only can you<br>
slap two of these things together, but it has (rudimentary) SCSI (good for<br>
an old CD-ROM or maybe tape), a 48k sample rate, and excellent sheilding<br>
(granted, it's no Turtle Beach, but still better than many cards being<br>
produced today).  Do watch out that you don't fry your amp though, as it<br>
has a 4 watt per channel preamp output. <br>
<p>

<p>
MV went chapter 11 some years ago and never reentered the consumer market.<br>
They had the first 3D sound card and a nice video capture board that's<br>
basic but decent that you can find for about $50.  The PAS is still a fine<br>
card, and you shouldn't be afraid to use it.  However, there's no need to<br>
use the onboard SB chip.  Just don't bother.<br>
