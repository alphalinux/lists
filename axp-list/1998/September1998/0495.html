With regards to your message at 05:36 PM 09-19-98 METDST, furio ercolessi.<br>
Where you stated:<br>
<i>&gt;Hi all,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I summarize my current state of affairs with the Samsung</i><br>
<i>&gt;PC164UX a.k.a. Ruffian.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Problem</i><br>
<i>&gt;-------</i><br>
<i>&gt;As previously reported, I have been plagued by instabilities caused </i><br>
<i>&gt;by paging-related errors, clearly observable under memory-intensive load</i><br>
<i>&gt;but they also occur with a light load (as Linux uses all the memory</i><br>
<i>&gt;anyway).</i><br>
<i>&gt;The errors, as observed under 2.0.35, fall into these categories:</i><br>
<i>&gt;(a) kswapd going 'Oops 0'</i><br>
<i>&gt;(b) Erratic 'Unable to handle kernel paging request' from an application</i><br>
<i>&gt;(c) 'Aiee, killing interrupt handler' from swapper</i><br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;(2) was done following a suggestion of Deskstation support;</i><br>
<i>&gt;They have merely given me the setup of their Linux system and have no </i><br>
<i>&gt;understanding of the problem. They say that the hardware has been</i><br>
<i>&gt;extensively tested under NT, so that this must be a s/w problem.</i><br>
<i>&gt;They explicitly stated that they have difficulties in giving Linux</i><br>
<i>&gt;support because "Linux changes so fast".</i><br>
What a load. On 2 occasions I have spoken to Mike Kinney at Deskstation.<br>
The first was an enquiry that asked for him to finish/fix ldmilo.<br>
He then complained he did all he could, but that as linload.exe was not<br>
published as source, he could only guess at and approximate its<br>
functionality. Afte some phone calls and email Jim Paradis decided to solve<br>
this problem by getting permission and clarifying it was OK to publish<br>
these sources, which he has done a few months ago (late May?).<br>
I waited a while to see if anything would happen, and then in August I<br>
called him and asked if he now had plans to look at this. HEtold me that it<br>
was a low priority,a nd maybe "in a month". The month has now passed, so I<br>
think I will ask him again this week.<br>
<p>
The second was to ask if they could modify ARCSBIOS to support booting over<br>
a network, in BOOTP fashion. He left me a message explaining that this<br>
wouls be a lot of work as he "would have to support a lot of diffeent<br>
network interfaces." I called him and asked why he thought this. As the<br>
UX/AKA Ruffian has a built-in Tulip 21140 chip I saw that this would be<br>
sufficint for almost everyone. I suggested that they might see some<br>
interest on Beowulf style setups if they followed this simple path. I even<br>
asked if they could quote a cost for this work, if necessary. He called me<br>
back a few days late and said that they had "no available resources to do<br>
this".<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
