    TH&gt; On S/Linux, the text on a console is much smaller, and, in my<br>
    TH&gt; opinion, much nicer looking.  When I did a 'make config' I saw<br>
    TH&gt; an option for TGA_CONSOLE or something like that.  Does this<br>
    TH&gt; allow you to make your console text size small like that.<br>
<p>
A most emphatic *NO*<br>
<p>
CONFIG_TGA_CONSOLE (and its cousin CONFIG_FB_TGA) have nothing to do<br>
with the console font.  TGA is a kind of video card manufactured by<br>
Digital; on some machines (e.g. some models of the UDB/Multia), the<br>
TGA device is integrated on the motherboard.  On others, it is an<br>
adapter card plugged into the PCI bus.  It is not compatible with VGA<br>
in any way, shape, or form.<br>
<p>
To change the console font, I'd imagine that you'd have to mess around<br>
with some of the options in the frame buffer configuration section.<br>
I'm not certain what all is involved, as I only recently have started<br>
to play around with the frame buffer code.<br>
<p>
    TH&gt; My other question is how do I make it so I can telnet in as<br>
    TH&gt; root?<br>
<p>
In order of decreasing badness, here's what you can do:<br>
<p>
1. Add every terminal device (only ttys, not ptys) on your system to<br>
   /etc/securetty.  This is a Very Bad Thing as it exposes the root<br>
   account to direct attack, i.e. DON'T DO THIS.<br>
<p>
2. Create a normal user account that would be used for day-to-day<br>
   tasks (reading email, browsing the web, etc.) and only 'su' to root<br>
   as needed.  Beware that when 'su'ing to root while connected to a<br>
   computer via TELNET, the root password is sent over the network as<br>
   plaintext (same as in #1 above).<br>
<p>
3. Install some form of secure login system, and use that to gain root<br>
   access remotely (whether directly or via 'su').  SSL-enabled<br>
   telnet/telnetd is one possibility.  SSH is another (and what I use,<br>
   if I absolutely cannot get to the machine directly).  One-time<br>
   password systems such as S/key is a third (and probably the best<br>
   solution, when coupled with session data encryption).<br>
<p>
If you want to use S/key, you initially need secure (local) access to<br>
the machine to set up the one-time password system.  The more I think<br>
about it, the more I like S/key.  I've got a box at home with OpenBSD<br>
2.3 on it, which (OpenBSD) supports S/key, and it's pretty neat to<br>
play with.<br>
