I think I need to switch to decaf. The root= flag was the problem (and HUGE<br>
props to EVERYONE who was cool enough to offer additional advice which I<br>
also used to good effect), I had come across a reference to it in the list<br>
archives but I wasn't typing it within the "..." with the rest of the flags<br>
so it was of course saying that it was invalid. <br>
&lt;cringe&gt;<br>
ANYhoo...got THAT taken care of, nice and predictable, danced thru the<br>
install, got to fdisk, made four partitions and started the first (swap)<br>
partition on cyl 3 to leave room to load aboot in front of the first<br>
partition. Rest of install buzzed along just fine.<br>
<p>
Then, according to all the people who were really cool and offered me help<br>
(Jay and Michal were especially thorough in providing add'l documentation),<br>
I need to reboot from the second partition on the hd, okay, fine,<br>
everything is still fine, that works great, I boot on my kernel floppy,<br>
point root at the hard drive, clackety clackety, login and am at the<br>
command prompt. YAYYY! I have an OS! <br>
<p>
But NOW I'm supposed to re-fdisk BSD-style, entering the same values for<br>
start and end cyls as I did the first time thru. Then reboot again, and<br>
install aboot onto that little piece of real estate in front of my first<br>
partition. Then I can do 'set' at the SRM prompt in order to set my default<br>
boot string and device and VOILA, I will be able to boot as normal. This<br>
sounds okay to me.<br>
<p>
Okay, no prob, get into fdisk, choose b option, supposedly I should delete<br>
the existing partitions now (yes?) and re-enter new BSD diskimage with<br>
starts and stops on identical cylinders to avoid trashing the existing FS<br>
(no prob, I wrote them all down) until I get to the place where I have to<br>
pick a file system type. Should I choose the hex val for BSD 4.2, 4.3,<br>
leave it as undef'd, or just get a really really heavy hammer and bash my<br>
skull in before I do something really stupid?<br>
<p>
I left the original partition table as is until I can figure this one out.<br>
Advice??<br>
<p>
Also, while sitting around at the prompt (and getting ready to reboot) I<br>
was doing a little checking around and had another disturbing problem.<br>
<p>
Typing 'man [whatever]' at the prompt returns a 'segmentation error' if<br>
[whatever] happens to be something that man pages *do* exist for. Simply<br>
typing 'man' or 'man barfoobar' returns the usual 'hey, pick something I<br>
have a man page for, ya big dork' prompt so it appears that the man program<br>
itself is okay, but the man PAGES have a problem...<br>
<p>
True? Fixable?<br>
<p>
Thanks again to everyone!<br>
