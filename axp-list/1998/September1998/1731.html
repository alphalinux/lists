Thanks for sticking up for the board.  Yes, it takes resources, but it<br>
does give many benefits.  I don't remember the 48k sample rate, but if it<br>
works, more power.<br>
<p>
PAS 16 units have dual sound chips - a benefit is that it can be set up as<br>
full duplex, among the first if its kind.  It also (at least mine) has<br>
dual line-ins (plus an additional mic input!) which was useful for me.  I<br>
had no problem using my card in my Miata, in parallel with the built-in<br>
ESS sound chip.  The NT driver is old and possibly designed for 3.5, so<br>
that is a bit buggy.  If you want to save resources, use only PAS 16, not<br>
SB emulation as the last person suggested.<br>

<p>
I have a PAS variation called the 'Memphis'.  It is basicly a multimedia <br>
station - it had an external base that housed the SCSI CD-ROM, RCA line in<br>
and out, DIN MIDI jacks and detachable BOSE speakers.  I still won't give<br>
it up for the original price - 400$ five or six YEARS ago.  And the CD-ROM<br>
is dead - blast NEC crap - those things know when the warranty expires<br>
and promptly mess up after that it seems.<br>
<p>
My only frustration is that it's hardware is *slightly* different from the<br>
plain PAS16 so the Linux PAS 16 SCSI driver *never* worked for me and I<br>
don't know how to fix that.  So it just locks my system when I tried to<br>
mount an attached drive.<br>
<p>
The Media Vision team went to work under the company name 'Aureal', which<br>
they make A3D chips and standards.  Their newest (DSP) sound mixing chip<br>
is capable of 300 MIPS I think.  I wonder if anyone's tried to make Linux<br>
drivers or programs.<br>
<p>
A different company bought the 'MV' name, but I don't know if they ever<br>
did it justice.<br>
<p>
As for true Sound Blaster - I've never touched them.  Creative won't back<br>
them up with a warranty longer than 90 days.  Most people don't have any<br>
trouble with the cards, but if they were truly any good, 1 year wouldn't<br>
hurt them any.  I had a Creative CDROM that wouldn't spin down after 2<br>
hours of idle time, so I thought that the warranty wasn't going to help me<br>
if the thing died, promptly returning them.<br>
