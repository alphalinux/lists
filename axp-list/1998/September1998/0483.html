Hi all,<br>
<p>
I summarize my current state of affairs with the Samsung<br>
PC164UX a.k.a. Ruffian.<br>
<p>
Problem<br>
-------<br>
As previously reported, I have been plagued by instabilities caused <br>
by paging-related errors, clearly observable under memory-intensive load<br>
but they also occur with a light load (as Linux uses all the memory<br>
anyway).<br>
The errors, as observed under 2.0.35, fall into these categories:<br>
(a) kswapd going 'Oops 0'<br>
(b) Erratic 'Unable to handle kernel paging request' from an application<br>
(c) 'Aiee, killing interrupt handler' from swapper<br>
observed on three distinct machines, one with Fujutsu MAB 4.5GB and <br>
other two with Seagate Cheetah 9GB, each tested with 256 or 512MB RAM.<br>
Which one is actually observed depends on the configuration details<br>
and on the compiler used (I used mostly gcc 2.7.2.3 and egcs 1.1).<br>
<p>
Similar or related symptoms have been also observed by other users of<br>
this machine on this list (Adrian Gartland, Tilo Wettig, Ulrich<br>
Stille on 2.0.x but not 2.1.x, Jay Estabrook?), but other users did not <br>
observe them (Michal Jaegermann).<br>
<p>
A test on one of my machines using 2.1.122 produced either error (a),<br>
or a new kind of error (coming from page_io.c which changed in 2.1.x):<br>
(d) swap_cache: replacing page-cached entry on page fffffc0007692000<br>
    Kernel panic: Tried to swap a non-swapper page<br>
<p>
Empirical fixes<br>
---------------<br>
I have been able to eliminate (at least under my test conditions)<br>
the problem on 2.0.35 by doing ANY one of the following actions:<br>
(1) reduce the amount of memory used by Linux (from MILO)<br>
    down to 224MB (even for the 512MB it was necessary to go<br>
    down to that number);<br>
(2) redefine the partitions so that both swap and Linux (not just<br>
    the kernel!) sit within the first GB of the disk;<br>
(3) increase the parameter SHMMAX in include/asm/shmparam.h from<br>
    0x3fa000 to 0x1000000.<br>
Everything was done on an empirical basis, following suggestions<br>
sent me by various people and a lot of fiddling, and for none of <br>
them I have a real understanding of what is actually happening.<br>
<p>
(2) was done following a suggestion of Deskstation support;<br>
They have merely given me the setup of their Linux system and have no <br>
understanding of the problem. They say that the hardware has been<br>
extensively tested under NT, so that this must be a s/w problem.<br>
They explicitly stated that they have difficulties in giving Linux<br>
support because "Linux changes so fast".<br>
<p>
(3) is a suggestion from Tilo Wettig, since that fixed his cdrom burner.<br>
I do not know the implications of this change.<br>
<p>
However, none of these actions seem to be effective in removing the<br>
problem on 2.1.122.  This seems to suggest that they are<br>
masquerading the problem, making it less likely to occur, rather than <br>
removing it.  Also, it suggests debugging the problem may be faster<br>
on 2.1.x, since it is more visible.  However, these findings are in<br>
sharp contrast with Ulrich Stille's findings, that 2.0.x crashes<br>
but 2.1.x does not.  This may be due to the compiler, as he<br>
uses gcc 2.8.1 that I do not have installed at present.<br>
<p>
We will probably put the machines into production using 2.0.35<br>
with fix number (3) and crossing fingers, but the problem is really <br>
still open.<br>
<p>
Thanks to everybody who corresponded with me on this issue.<br>
