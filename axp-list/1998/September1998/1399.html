Thanks.  Well, first off, I'm one of those people who bought a $300 Alpha<br>
box from the auctioneers.  If anyone is curious what kind of machine they<br>
are, and if they should buy one, just follow this thread.  I'll let everyone<br>
know the pro's and con's and you should get a pretty good feel for 'em.<br>
<p>
I have always wanted an Alpha and finally got a chance.  Even if it is only<br>
233...<br>
<p>
So far, I've made a floppy using rawrite.exe on the linux CD-ROM.  The image<br>
files were avanti.img, ramdisk.img, and resc1440.bin.  The workstation comes<br>
with Ultra SCSI 2 onboard, but I have Ultra Wide HD's and wish to disable<br>
the onboard SCSI chip, and use my own PCI Adaptec 2940 UW Controller.  I<br>
also have an additional PCI NIC.  It is a 3Com 10/100 3C905B TX.  This<br>
computer is going to be used primarily for a bridging firewall.  The 10<br>
Mbit/sec card included is going to the 4 Mbit/sec internet connection side,<br>
and the 100 Mbit/sec card is on our switched Ethernet side.  The video<br>
adapter is a cheezy 1 MB Trident ISA card.  My HD is a new unformatted IBM<br>
4.3G UW.<br>
<p>
The way it's set up now is, it will boot up to the blue screen with three<br>
pointers. (&gt;&gt;&gt;)  I think that's SRM??   I've made it boot to an "aboot"<br>
prompt using the avanti.img disk with the command boot dva0.  It will get to<br>
a point where it asks me for the location and name of a kernel.  That's<br>
pretty much where I'm stuck.<br>
<p>
The firmware still hasn't come in the mail, so I am just fooling around with<br>
the HD connected to a 68-50 pin converter and using the onboard SCSI for<br>
testing.  Hopefully, with the arrival of the firmware, I'll be able to add<br>
my SCSI adapter to the list and take off the onboard one.<br>
<p>
Thank you for the help and please let me know if you need more specifics,<br>
and I'll try to get them for you.<br>
<p>

I might be able to give some pointers if you give me info on who you got the<br>
machine from, how it's configured now, and so on.  You'll have to make three<br>
start up floppies, no big deal, but it depends on the CD you have.  send me<br>
a full description of what you have and maybe I can help.<br>

<i>&gt;Hello everyone,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm not a newbie to Linux, but I am however a newbie to Alpha systems.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Recently I purchased a Digital Alphastation 200.  It did not come with a HD</i><br>
<i>&gt;or firmware CD.  I ordered the firmware CD and hopefully, after running</i><br>
that<br>
<i>&gt;CD, will be able to tell the system to look for my new PCI SCSI controller</i><br>
<i>&gt;and added PCI NIC.  My question is, and forgive me if it seems too</i><br>
<i>&gt;all-incompasing, how do I get linux to begin installing once I have the</i><br>
<i>&gt;system set up and recognizing my hardware?  I tried to create a boot disk</i><br>
<i>&gt;via the FAQ, but my intel box running linux gave me weird errors and would</i><br>
<i>&gt;not run make.  Also, do I have sufficient source files on my RedHat Linux</i><br>
<i>&gt;5.0 for intel CD-ROM?  Or do I have to call RedHat and order a specific</i><br>
&lt;sinp&gt;<br>
