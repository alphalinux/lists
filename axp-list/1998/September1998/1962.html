Why is the log of nmbd saying this:<br>
add_name_to_subnet: Added netbios name ALPHA with first IP 147.129.131.140 40 ttl=144-- nb_flags=0 to subnet 147.129.131.140<br>
<p>
My question...  WHy is it saying 140 is the subnet?<br>
If I shut off wins nmblookup starts to work?  What is up with that?<br>
<p>
Here is my smb.conf<br>
# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the<br>
# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed<br>
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options (perhaps too<br>
# many!) most of which are not shown in this example<br>
#<br>
# Any line which starts with a ; (semi-colon) or a # (hash) <br>
# is a comment and is ignored. In this example we will use a #<br>
# for commentry and a ; for parts of the config file that you<br>
# may wish to enable<br>
#<br>
# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command "testparm"<br>
# to check that you have not many any basic syntactic errors. <br>
