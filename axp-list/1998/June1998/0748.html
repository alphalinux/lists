<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; (or cc1plus or cc1obj, etc.).</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Wonderful. Another way to confuse a user.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, users who might get confused shouldn't use -v -- or Fortran,</i><br>
<i>&gt; gcc, or UNIX, etc. for that matter.  :)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But, if you have some recommendations, or, ideally, patches to offer</i><br>
<i>&gt; to reduce this problem -- which, BTW, I don't recall seeing anybody</i><br>
<i>&gt; else run into -- submit them to the appropriate address, by all</i><br>
<i>&gt; means!  I'm all for making products less confusing.  Note that these</i><br>
<i>&gt; patches/recommendations could target the docs, not necessarily</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ways the products work.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Switching '-pg' to '-p' muddies the waters. Why pick a flag<br>
already associated with different meaning from the users<br>
point of view? Only reason I see is that gxx does not intend<br>
to ever support the old mode and so just changed it's<br>
meaning to the new mode of profiling in the internal code.<br>
The docs should definitely stop referencing the prof binary<br>
since it seems to have disappeared though.<br>
<p>
If I see a need to submit a bug report, I will. Not to the point<br>
yet that I understand what's wrong. Once I do, I'll let the<br>
appropriate folks know. For now I'm just looking to see if<br>
anyone else has had better luck with it than I have. So far,<br>
it doesn't look like it. At least no one admits they have...<br>
Maybe they don't give a sh*t...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;I'm only looking at symptoms. I make no claims that what</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I see and what is happening are necessarily related.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; All I can say is that your original email seemed to say exactly</i><br>
<i>&gt; that.  Chalk it up to a misunderstanding, I guess.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Perhaps you should submit a bug report?  Both g77 and gcc come</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; with extensive documentation, including on how and where to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; file bug reports.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I look at bug reports as a last option. With source, available,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that would be where I look first.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hmm, though you should be aware that, in effect, you submitted</i><br>
<i>&gt; a bug report to a list that contains a small subset of the people</i><br>
<i>&gt; who *normally* would see a properly submitted bug report, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; thus excluded from your audience quite a number of people</i><br>
<i>&gt; (especially if it was egcs-related) who might have been able</i><br>
<i>&gt; to offer some real help that much quicker.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; At least, it looked to *me* like you were trying to submit a</i><br>
<i>&gt; bug report saying `-p' was incorrectly passed to f771 instead</i><br>
<i>&gt; of `-pg'.  If anyone else disagrees, I hope they'll speak up;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I could certainly use a lesson in how to avoid responding to</i><br>
<i>&gt; bug reports that aren't, so I can spend more time getting</i><br>
<i>&gt; productive work done.</i><br>
<p>
Here is what I said:<br>
<p>
"I've got binaries where I mix C/FORTRAN and am trying<br>
to gprof them on a RH5.0 system. Strictly C programs<br>
appear to profile fine after adding the '-pg' flag to the<br>
compile/link. However, when I add this flag to g77,<br>
it seems to convert it to '-p'.  Not what I want to<br>
have happen. Is this what it does?? If so, why??"<br>
<p>
Looks to me like I asked if this is normal and if so<br>
WHY? Since I know '-p' is different from '-pg', I<br>
noticed it was doing something that looked odd.<br>
English... great language to communicate in....<br>
Think you implied the inverse of my statement about<br>
'-p'. No where did I say gcc didn't do that. I just<br>
said what I observed g77 doing....<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The link shows gcrt1.o at the front and C profiles OK so</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I think things are basically working. Question is what</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;is missing for FORTRAN. I'll do some more looking.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;No obvious differences now. The xxx.o has _mcount in it,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and the link uses the correct gcrt1.o file. Maybe it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;a library issue?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe the egcs fix to profiling for the Alpha that you learned</i><br>
<i>&gt; about after writing the above will address your problems, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; I still would hazard a guess that something might be specially</i><br>
<i>&gt; needed to make profiling work for Fortran, since you saw it work</i><br>
<i>&gt; well (enough, anyway) for C code but not at all for Fortran code.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's a coincidence, though; I just got another profiling-related</i><br>
<i>&gt; question from a completely different source regarding a special</i><br>
<i>&gt; variant of g77 (for Solaris SPARC, not Alpha).  Guess I might</i><br>
<i>&gt; have to learn about profiling Fortran code after all.  :)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
egcs1.0.3a is no better than 1.0.2. Still studying the<br>
problem and leaning toward a library problem of some sort,<br>
like more than one version of _mcount being around and not<br>
being compatible with each other. (a guess.... not a bug<br>
report)<br>
