As Uncle George said, don't assume because the program came on the<br>
CD it is working. The errata/updates are testimony to the fact it may not<br>
work. There are many programs that have been fixed. I suspect RH5.1<br>
will be significantly more stable than RH5.0. If you're looking for a more<br>
trouble free install, use RH4.2. The problem though is the change in C<br>
libraries. That's a major headache. Everything I have that did not come<br>
with RH5.0, had to be recompiled to run on the new system. Not a<br>
big deal to me but the average non-programmer would find that to<br>
be a nightmare. I get the feeling you might not do alot of programming.<br>
Correct me if I'm wrong. Using gdb is the standard way to find this<br>
sort of problem. Even if the process is already running, you can use<br>
gdb and use the 'attach' sub-command to hook up to it and see what<br>
it's doing.<br>
<p>
As far as SCSI usage goes, I use 2940UW and NCR810/875 adapters<br>
in my systems. No more than 2 drives plus a tape drive though. Since it's<br>
not just a single system having problems (assuming you all did your<br>
installs independently) it seems unlikely to be a HW issue. If they all<br>
are configured by the same person, the same way, it might be HW<br>
though. How about scaling back to a single drive and running tests<br>
to see if that works? Did you all use the same set of CD's to install<br>
from? Got to be some common link in the systems.<br>
