For the purposes of discussion, lets call this new windowing system "Y"<br>
<p>
Quoting Christopher Curtis (<a href="mailto:ccurtis@ee.fit.edu">ccurtis@ee.fit.edu</a>):<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; - upwards compatible with X servers/clients.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not necessarily.  It will need a X server client of it's own (that is,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's own version of eXceed).</i><br>
<p>
I'm confused.  You mean a client that runs on an X server that implements a<br>
"Y" server?  Because you'd need some way to make sure the thousands of X<br>
clients still run, and you'd also hopefully want to still run on all those X<br>
servers out there.  Do I have to mention my NCD X-terminal here?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; - truely object oriented instead of the half-assed "objects in C" like Xt and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   Motif currently do.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Absolutely under no circumstances whatsoever.  ANSI-C *only*!  This is one</i><br>
<i>&gt; of my biggest gripes with the Berlin people.  The next is the registry.</i><br>
<p>
Registrys are for idiots, but I disagree entirely about OO.  There are a lot<br>
of things that OO does really badly, but windowing systems is one of the<br>
things it's good for.<br>
<p>
Xt is a half-assed attempt to do OO in C.  It's not bad, but I've seen better.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; me to go into the details here, but the biggest failing is in colormap</i><br>
<p>
But I think that's an API problem, rather than a problem with the underlying<br>
protocol.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; handling.  Run X in an 8-bit display sometime for a while.  Under Solaris</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyway, colors disappear in time.  Netscape (with the -install option)</i><br>
<p>
I run an 8-bit display all the time (UDB with TGA, remember?)<br>
A lot of programmers aren't very good at managing public and private<br>
colormaps, and so they consume the whole colormap pretty fast.  I have<br>
strategies for that (mostly avoiding running Netscape until *after* running<br>
anything color intensive).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The next problem of X is the bandwidth.  X is virtually unusable across an</i><br>
<p>
Well, you've already mentioned LBX.  I think it's good that X is extenisible<br>
in order to add stuff like that, and still remain backwards compatible.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; compression.  Now, I'm no X expert so I may be way off base here, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; another thing that would be nice is an event mask.  A lot of applications</i><br>
<p>
There already is one, but I think it's on the client side, not the server<br>
side.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; defaults mechanism is also needed.  There should, IMHO, be three</i><br>
<i>&gt; configuration files for each program - one in .../app-defaults, one in</i><br>
<i>&gt; .../app-defaults/fixed, and one in the user's home directory - just like</i><br>
<i>&gt; the setup for Pine.  There should be *NO* registry.</i><br>
<p>
That sounds pretty much like the standard set-up to me.  Just set up the<br>
system wide XAPPLRESDIR, and you're golden.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To be honest, there are some things for X to learn from Windoze.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; WinFrame stuff is pretty efficient (of course, done so at the expense of</i><br>
<i>&gt; configurability, but nonetheless...)</i><br>
<p>
The MAIN thing I hate about Windows is the lack of an equivalent to the X<br>
Resource Database.<br>
