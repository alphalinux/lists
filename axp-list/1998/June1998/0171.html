<i>&gt; Hello,</i><br>
<i>&gt;     I just purchased a Matrosx Millenium I 4meg card for my UDB. However,</i><br>
 when I tried to install the card, the machine didn't boot up. I figured that a <br>
video conflict might be the source, so I tried removing the card and switched <br>
back to the onboard TGA. Unfortunately, the box still will not boot. I don't <br>
get any flashes from the LED, nor does my monitor ever switch on (it stays in <br>
power-save mode). I have already tried reseating the memory, reinstalling the <br>
card, checking all power connections, but to no use. Can anyone please offer <br>
any help?<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I tried a Matrox Mystique and mine wouldn't boot either, the machine seemed to <br>
die at the SRM console on the TGA output and nothing on the Matrox.  Took the <br>
Matrox out and the machine got into ARC but all hell broke loose with the NVRAM <br>
apparently having been wiped.  Anyway, I then tried an S3Trio64V2 card with 2MB <br>
and it got into ARC and I corrected the various errors (date/time and boot <br>
parameters) and got back into Linux but once that started booting the kernel <br>
woudln't recognise the VGA card so the thing booted with the TGA live.  I <br>
compiled the kernel with TGA disabled and tried again and this time it fired up <br>
OK and I installed the 5.0 XFree_S3 rpm and got X up on my crappy SVGA monitor.<br>
<p>
Then I plugged my Sun monitor in with the appropriate modelines from my TGA set <br>
up and the thing would not work, seems the S3 is rather more strict about the <br>
scan frequencies than the TGA and I couldn't get anything to work.  Back to the <br>
SVGA at 1024x768i to try it out and found that yes, the TGA card is pretty slow <br>
by comparison with this rather feeble PCI card, and it was nice to have 16 bit <br>
colour.  But the bloody thing locks up hard, can't even ping the machine.  So, <br>
the card is out and I'm back to the TGA.<br>
<p>
Any suggestions on a better card, one that works maybe?  I read somewhere that <br>
the Diamond Stealth 3D is flexible enough to drive my monitor, anyone got one <br>
running in a UDB?<br>
