"IBM in talks with Compaq about Alpha licensing<br>
<p>

IBM is negotiating the licensing of the Alpha architecture from Digital<br>
Equipment, now officially part of Compaq, a spokeswoman for IBM in the<br>
Netherlands confirmed this week.<br>
<p>
IBM confirmed that prior to the Compaq acquisition, Digital approached IBM<br>
and that talks are now being held between Digital's new owner, Compaq, and<br>
IBM. Big Blue did not want to elaborate on ongoing negotiations between the<br>
two companies.<br>
<p>
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission forced Digital to enter negotiations with<br>
IBM and other processor manufacturers in April of this year, when the body<br>
gave its seal of approval to Intel purchasing Digital's Alpha manufacturing<br>
plant.<br>
<p>
The settlement followed a period of litigation between Intel and Digital.<br>
Digital sued Intel on May 12, 1997, claiming patent infringement. Intel's<br>
response came on May 27 of the same year, when Intel countersued Digital. In<br>
August 1997, Intel followed up with another lawsuit, accusing Digital of<br>
using Intel patents in the Alpha processors. Eventually, in October of last<br>
year, both parties agreed to settle.<br>
<p>
The settlement resulted in Intel and Digital agreeing to exchange their<br>
respective patents for a 10-year period and to Digital's sale of its Alpha<br>
manufacturing facilities to Intel. Intel, in turn, is obliged to produce the<br>
chips for Digital -- now part of Compaq -- for the next seven years.<br>
Development of future versions of the Alpha processor will still be<br>
conducted by Digital, which kept the intellectual property rights to the<br>
Alpha. This means that Digital can have third-party involvement in the<br>
development of the processor.<br>
<p>
The FTC had to give its approval for the settlement, considering the<br>
dominant position of Intel in processor chips. Documents released by the FTC<br>
reveal that the agency would only agree to the terms of the settlement if<br>
Digital would also make its Alpha technology available to chip manufacturers<br>
other than Intel. The FTC went so far as to mention these companies: Digital<br>
must enter talks with Korean vendor Samsung Electronics, which already<br>
produces Alpha chips, as well as with Advanced Micro Devices and IBM.<br>
<p>
On Thursday a Compaq official in Hong Kong said his company was holding<br>
talks with AMD over licensing Alpha technology. "<br>
