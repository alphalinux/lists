<i>&gt; Since when did the X server, compilers, and browser become partof the OS?? </i><br>
<i>&gt; They are important applications but certainly not</i><br>
<i>&gt; part of the OS. Maybe you're thinking like someone else I won't</i><br>
<i>&gt; mention here.</i><br>
<p>
The compiler was part of Unix since about 1978 when Unix(TM) shipped<br>
with a compiler; X has been part of the OS since the start of this<br>
decade whenevery other Unix system shipped with it.<br>
<p>
I don't care about distinguishing what is part of the OS etc.;<br>
I regard the OS as the thing which makes the machine 'usable'.<br>
These days X is part of usability, and for a Unix system a compiler<br>
is also needed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I use a Matrox and an ATI RAGE II. Both work except for the 20</i><br>
<i>&gt; windows problem.</i><br>
<p>
Yeh - a 20 window limit - its a laugh isn't it.....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Though I don't use C++ in my line of work, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; thought egcs 1.0.2 was working??</i><br>
<p>
EGCS works OK - but its development and is not 100% stable - just<br>
see what a mess it makes of building the X server.  Anyway its stable<br>
for most C++ work - but again its no use for the basic user - he doesn't<br>
want ot have to mess about; he wants to put his Linux distribution disc in,<br>
tell it a little about how he wants it set up, go away for a coffee and<br>
come back with a working machine.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; IDE does *work*, just not in</i><br>
<i>&gt; DMA mode. Still haven't been able to confirm DMA mode in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2.1.xx kernels works on my systems yet though.</i><br>
<p>
Yeh IDE works; but at 2.5MB/s - great; perhaps I should just go back to a<br>
386.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Course, you could</i><br>
<i>&gt; always put up the $50 for a NCR810 SCSI card.</i><br>
<p>
And then pay through the nose for discs; not these days when I can<br>
buy an 8GB IDE disc for trivial amounts.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Once Linux/Alpha distributions have a stable environment in which people</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; can work, then people can basically use the machine as a production</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; machine and fix porting problems in applications.  But at the moment,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; having used Linux/Alpha very happily for 5 months, I would not recommend</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it to be used by anyone on a day-to-day basis.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You've used it "happily" but don't recommend it. Seems a contradictionto me.</i><br>
<p>
Yeh - I was unhappy with it to start with; and it still REALLY annoys me from<br>
time<br>
to time.  But I'm capable of debugging things and working through problems; many<br>
Linux/Intel users can just get on and use their machine - you can't do that on<br>
Alpha.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Shouldn't live on the bleeding edge. If this bothers you, go back to RH4.2or wait for RH5.1. Are you</i><br>
<i>&gt; using a Matrox Millenium II or the old</i><br>
<i>&gt; card? Mine is the old card and it works fine. It's interesting to me that</i><br>
<i>&gt; people just expect things to work for their HW setup. I usually go</i><br>
<i>&gt; find out what works and only buy that to start with. Doesn't matter</i><br>
<i>&gt; what OS/HW combination it is. That's pretty much the smartest</i><br>
<i>&gt; way to go to minimize headaches later.</i><br>
<p>
You can't buy the old Mill's any more. Yes I do expect one of the most popular<br>
cards to work, especially when the source is out there.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   Well, it's there enough for folks to buy 50-100 systems for compute</i><br>
<i>&gt; farms so I guess I disagree with your conclusion.</i><br>
<p>
Yeh - but not for general use; Linux/Alpha works OK where you can afford to<br>
have a bit of a fight to get your single application running and then leave<br>
it burning CPU cycles all day.<br>
