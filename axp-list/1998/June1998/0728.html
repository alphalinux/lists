<i>&gt; &gt; Since when did the X server, compilers, and browser become partof the OS??</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; They are important applications but certainly not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; part of the OS. Maybe you're thinking like someone else I won't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; mention here.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The compiler was part of Unix since about 1978 when Unix(TM) shipped</i><br>
<i>&gt; with a compiler; X has been part of the OS since the start of this</i><br>
<i>&gt; decade whenevery other Unix system shipped with it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
You can buy UNIX systems from vendors without compilers, X,and browsers. They are not a pre-req to making<br>
the system  run.<br>
OTOH, the C runtime is. And, I thought UNIX appeared in<br>
1969, not 1978. Had to have a PDP-8 or something like that<br>
to run it back then. First UNIX I used was on a PDP-11, long<br>
ago....far away...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I don't care about distinguishing what is part of the OS etc.;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I regard the OS as the thing which makes the machine 'usable'.</i><br>
<i>&gt; These days X is part of usability, and for a Unix system a compiler</i><br>
<i>&gt; is also needed.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I agree. They are very useful applications and I could not do myjob without them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I use a Matrox and an ATI RAGE II. Both work except for the 20</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; windows problem.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yeh - a 20 window limit - its a laugh isn't it.....</i><br>
<p>
Not really, I rarely run more than 6-8 windows. Anyway, it's abug in X that is the problem. Someone<br>
posted a workaround for it<br>
a while back. Don't know if the change was card specific though.<br>
Again, pointer/int problems strike....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Though I don't use C++ in my line of work, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; thought egcs 1.0.2 was working??</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; EGCS works OK - but its development and is not 100% stable - just</i><br>
<i>&gt; see what a mess it makes of building the X server.  Anyway its stable</i><br>
<i>&gt; for most C++ work - but again its no use for the basic user - he doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; want ot have to mess about; he wants to put his Linux distribution disc in,</i><br>
<i>&gt; tell it a little about how he wants it set up, go away for a coffee and</i><br>
<i>&gt; come back with a working machine.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I agree the casual user thinks this way. If one is in that category,stay away from 'x.0' releases, on ANY<br>
OS.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; IDE does *work*, just not in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; DMA mode. Still haven't been able to confirm DMA mode in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 2.1.xx kernels works on my systems yet though.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yeh IDE works; but at 2.5MB/s - great; perhaps I should just go back to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; 386.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
386's don't support DMA transfers and run about half that speed or less.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Course, you could</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; always put up the $50 for a NCR810 SCSI card.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; And then pay through the nose for discs; not these days when I can</i><br>
<i>&gt; buy an 8GB IDE disc for trivial amounts.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Define trivial. I can buy SCSI disks for $.06-.07 per MB anytime. That's plentycheap. (last 9GB drives I<br>
bought were on sale and about $.045/MB) EIDE<br>
is cheaper but usually a bit slower, even on Intels. SCSI is now at the<br>
price EIDE was at about 6 months back. It's following the same<br>
price curve.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Once Linux/Alpha distributions have a stable environment in which people</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; can work, then people can basically use the machine as a production</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; machine and fix porting problems in applications.  But at the moment,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; having used Linux/Alpha very happily for 5 months, I would not recommend</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; it to be used by anyone on a day-to-day basis.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; You've used it "happily" but don't recommend it. Seems a contradictionto me.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yeh - I was unhappy with it to start with; and it still REALLY annoys me from</i><br>
<i>&gt; time</i><br>
<i>&gt; to time.  But I'm capable of debugging things and working through problems; many</i><br>
<i>&gt; Linux/Intel users can just get on and use their machine - you can't do that on</i><br>
<i>&gt; Alpha.</i><br>
<p>
Wait until Merced happens.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Shouldn't live on the bleeding edge. If this bothers you, go back to RH4.2or wait for RH5.1. Are you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; using a Matrox Millenium II or the old</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; card? Mine is the old card and it works fine. It's interesting to me that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; people just expect things to work for their HW setup. I usually go</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; find out what works and only buy that to start with. Doesn't matter</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; what OS/HW combination it is. That's pretty much the smartest</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; way to go to minimize headaches later.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You can't buy the old Mill's any more. Yes I do expect one of the most popular</i><br>
<i>&gt; cards to work, especially when the source is out there.</i><br>
<p>
Debug it. I doubt the guy writing the code has an Alpha to test on.Volunteer to help him if you want it<br>
to work. Many people would<br>
be thankful for your assistance in solving this problem.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   Well, it's there enough for folks to buy 50-100 systems for compute</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; farms so I guess I disagree with your conclusion.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yeh - but not for general use; Linux/Alpha works OK where you can afford to</i><br>
<i>&gt; have a bit of a fight to get your single application running and then leave</i><br>
<i>&gt; it burning CPU cycles all day.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Don't know about you but the guys buying all those machines probablyintend to make money with them, vs<br>
playing around with them.<br>
My interest is in using them to make money too. I need fast workhorses<br>
that are cheap. Alpha fits the bill better than any other microprocessor<br>
on the market at the moment. Both IBM and SUN are in the running<br>
though, if you can cut a good deal with them.<br>
