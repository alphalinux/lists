There's a *lot* of that sort of transformation of options going<br>
on in the gcc driver (and its kin, including g77).  cpp gets<br>
passed very different options; so do cc1/f771/cc1plus; so does<br>
as; so does ld.<br>
<p>
It's a *driver*.  Its job is to present a consistent user<br>
interface, and, being a GNU product, that across a wide<br>
variety of platforms, including those that might already have<br>
non-GNU `prof' on them (not likely to include Linux systems,<br>
is my guess).<br>
<p>
It *might* be nice to get the programs under control of gcc to<br>
accept exactly the same options gcc itself accepts, so they<br>
need no transformation, but that's probably impossible.  Certainly<br>
making as and ld, often not GNU programs, accept the literal<br>
options is impossible.  Making any of that work with `specs' files<br>
is probably impossible.  Making gcc refuse to accept any options<br>
or specifications it can't reliably pass to all these subprograms<br>
without filtering would make gcc unusable for 99.9% of its<br>
present audience.<br>
<p>
The end result is that, no matter what we do, users will likely<br>
see *something* they don't understand in the output of `g77 -v'.<br>
(The same is true for the output of `gcc -S', or even `gcc -E'.<br>
Expecting to read the output of these options without first<br>
studying what the output is *supposed* to be is unwise, though<br>
at least for -S and -E I've seen a few other people try to do so,<br>
but not for -v.)<br>
<p>
You can either take this as a suggestion to think apparent<br>
symptoms through a bit more, or as more opportunity to claim<br>
that gcc is somehow the "problem" here.  So far, IMO, you haven't<br>
persuaded anyone, certainly myself, about the latter.  In<br>
short, almost all output of any compiler is *going* to be<br>
confusing to users who don't take the time to learn how to<br>
properly understand that output -- especially output regarding<br>
internal goings-on.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If I see a need to submit a bug report, I will. Not to the point</i><br>
<i>&gt;yet that I understand what's wrong. Once I do, I'll let the</i><br>

<i>&gt;anyone else has had better luck with it than I have. So far,</i><br>
<i>&gt;it doesn't look like it. At least no one admits they have...</i><br>
<p>
You *already* submitted what looked like a bug report, as I said<br>
earlier, and to a list that included *some* of the "appropriate<br>
folks", like myself.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; At least, it looked to *me* like you were trying to submit a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; bug report saying `-p' was incorrectly passed to f771 instead</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of `-pg'.  If anyone else disagrees, I hope they'll speak up;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I could certainly use a lesson in how to avoid responding to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; bug reports that aren't, so I can spend more time getting</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; productive work done.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Here is what I said:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"I've got binaries where I mix C/FORTRAN and am trying</i><br>
<i>&gt;to gprof them on a RH5.0 system. Strictly C programs</i><br>
<i>&gt;appear to profile fine after adding the '-pg' flag to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;compile/link. However, when I add this flag to g77,</i><br>
<i>&gt;it seems to convert it to '-p'.  Not what I want to</i><br>
<i>&gt;have happen. Is this what it does?? If so, why??"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Looks to me like I asked if this is normal and if so</i><br>
<i>&gt;WHY? Since I know '-p' is different from '-pg', I</i><br>
<i>&gt;noticed it was doing something that looked odd.</i><br>
<i>&gt;English... great language to communicate in....</i><br>
<p>
I know English, dammit.  I worked as a technical writer for<br>
several years, starting at the Senior level, moving up to<br>
Lead, then Manager.  All as an "ex"-programmer.<br>
<p>
When you write "g77 does X.  Not what I want to have happen",<br>
that *is* a statement that g77 is doing something you don't<br>
want -- it's a bug report, just a poorly worded one, which<br>
is why I asked you *questions* about it.<br>
<p>
I guess I'll just learn to ignore bug reports you file in<br>
the future, here or elsewhere.  I've wasted an awful lot of<br>
time trying to explain the obvious here, and educate you<br>
about how to properly ask questions and report bugs in<br>
products.<br>
<p>
Though, the alternative in this case was that I completely ignored<br>
your original question in the first place, which could easily<br>
result in the statement "g77 doesn't do profiling right because<br>
it passes `-p' instead of `-pg' to the f771 driver" being spread<br>
far and wide.  That sort of thing *often* happens -- there are<br>
web pages with obsolete, somewhat incorrect information about g77<br>
that stemmed from initial, confused reports about its behavior<br>
(and the same is surely true about many other products) -- so<br>
it seemed appropriate *at the time* that I ask specific questions<br>
regarding why you considered g77 passing `-p' to be a bug.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Think you implied the inverse of my statement about</i><br>
<i>&gt;'-p'. No where did I say gcc didn't do that. I just</i><br>
<i>&gt;said what I observed g77 doing....</i><br>
<p>
No, you didn't *just* say that.  You said it was NOT WHAT YOU<br>
WANTED TO HAVE HAPPEN.  I can read English; please take some<br>
time to learn to write what you mean, or at least have the<br>
decency to admit that what you meant turned out to be wrong.<br>
(In this case, g77 passing `-p' *does* appear to be what you<br>
want to have happen.  You'd also like profiling to work<br>
generally; it doesn't; that appears to be a separate problem.)<br>
<p>
If you want a clue about how to word a report like that,<br>
consider this modest translation of the paragraph you<br>
quoted above:<br>
<p>
"I've got binaries where I mix C/FORTRAN and am trying<br>
to gprof them on a RH5.0 system. Strictly C programs<br>
appear to profile fine after adding the '-pg' flag to the<br>
compile/link. [But strictly/mixed Fortran programs, compiled the<br>
same way, don't profile properly at all (explain symptoms).]<br>
I notice that when I add this flag to g77, it seems to convert<br>
it to '-p'.  [I didn't check whether gcc did that; I suppose<br>
I should.]  Is anyone aware of whether f771 needs the `-pg'<br>
option passed to it for gprof to work?  Besides that, is<br>
anyone able to get g77 to output profilable programs, or<br>
know why it might or might not work?"<br>
<p>
The stuff in brackets is optional, depending on whether<br>
they state facts you knew at the time.<br>
<p>
If you thoughtfully compare what you wrote with the above,<br>
you should be able to see why your original quote appeared<br>
to be a bug report against *g77* because it wasn't faithfully<br>
passing `-pg' as such to the f771 driver -- as you said, it<br>
wasn't what you wanted to have happen.  But you didn't say<br>
*why* it wasn't what you wanted, and the construction of the<br>
paragraph implied that this was why you were (presumably)<br>
having trouble getting profiling working on your system.<br>
<p>
You can either learn from this quietly, or continue avoiding to.<br>
It's up to you.<br>
