<p>
The "www.berlin-consortium.org" have a very ambitious project if it is<br>
still active, but it is far from what I would consider ideal.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Note that in order to produce such a thing it would have to be:</i><br>
<i>&gt; - network transparent</i><br>
<p>
Absolutely.  Additionally, it would have to better support low bandwidth<br>
environments like 28.8k modems.  When X was designed, it was ethernet or<br>
token ring or 1200 baud modems, and they figured it was futile to try to<br>
make it run over 1200 baud (quite correctly, in fact).  However, in making<br>
this decision they decided to forego and bandwith considerations at all.<br>
The hack-on LBX extensions serve as a primary example.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; - portable as all hell</i><br>
<p>
Absolutely.  Much more judicous use of unions is needed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; - upwards compatible with X servers/clients.</i><br>
<p>
Not necessarily.  It will need a X server client of it's own (that is,<br>
it's own version of eXceed).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; - truely object oriented instead of the half-assed "objects in C" like Xt and</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Motif currently do.</i><br>
<p>
Absolutely under no circumstances whatsoever.  ANSI-C *only*!  This is one<br>
of my biggest gripes with the Berlin people.  The next is the registry.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; - Good support for accelerated hardware without cutting out "normal" hardware.</i><br>
<p>
This is the prototypical driver issue.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think you could achieve something like this with a new API that still spoke</i><br>
<i>&gt; X protocol underneath, providing it wasn't any slower than raw X.  Implement</i><br>
<i>&gt; it in C++ and Java to start, then turn it over to the community to do "my</i><br>
<i>&gt; favourite language" bindings.</i><br>
<p>
I suppose Java is a possibility, but I'm a horrid C bigot.  I think it's<br>
better to simply address the major failings of X and try to reimplement a<br>
better option.  There's a lot of "Why X sucks" links out there as is for<br>
me to go into the details here, but the biggest failing is in colormap<br>
handling.  Run X in an 8-bit display sometime for a while.  Under Solaris<br>
anyway, colors disappear in time.  Netscape (with the -install option)<br>
eventually fades to a very monochromatic grey scheme.  Loading it without<br>
-install means other programs won't run (like the GIMP).  And with<br>
-install, there's colormap flashing, which really sucks when playing<br>
xboing.  Frame Maker doesn't even have the -install option and appears<br>
with no highlights or shadows - everything is just one big block.  KDE is<br>
the most amazing window manager in this respect, but the problem persists.<br>
<p>
The next problem of X is the bandwidth.  X is virtually unusable across an<br>
ISDN, and only marginally better across a T1.  A lot can be done here with<br>
built-in proxies for, eg, window manager bitmaps, and at a minimum RLE<br>
compression.  Now, I'm no X expert so I may be way off base here, but<br>
another thing that would be nice is an event mask.  A lot of applications<br>
don't care when the mouse moves over them - these don't need to be<br>
transfered.  Neither do enter/exit messages.  Sad to say, but common<br>
dialogs would also be nice - or at least a method of caching and<br>
transferring fixed dialogs so the entire window doesn't have to be<br>
transferred.<br>
<p>
Then there's the font server.  Having a remote display uses the local font<br>
server.  This is very confusing and can be quite a limitation.  I would<br>
think that at a minimum the font servers should be able to query one<br>
another.  Additionally, X should not hang when the font server does it's<br>
thing.  I do think that whatever replaces X should be fully multithreaded,<br>
even if that means less portability.  :(<br>
<p>
These are my major gripes with X, but they are not ones that are easily<br>
repairable - they are faults intrisic to the system.  However, a new<br>
defaults mechanism is also needed.  There should, IMHO, be three<br>
configuration files for each program - one in .../app-defaults, one in<br>
.../app-defaults/fixed, and one in the user's home directory - just like<br>
the setup for Pine.  There should be *NO* registry.<br>
<p>
To be honest, there are some things for X to learn from Windoze.  The<br>
WinFrame stuff is pretty efficient (of course, done so at the expense of<br>
configurability, but nonetheless...)<br>
