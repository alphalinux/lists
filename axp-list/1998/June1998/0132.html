<i>&gt; various dialogs work, the crappy file open dialog, the registry (ack, spit).</i><br>
<p>
This is something that I think can be handled by a window manager.  GTK+,<br>
for instance, has common dialogs, and whatever the GNOME window manager is<br>
will probably use GTK+ and thus have access to these dialogs.  What would<br>
be nice at this point is a method for a client program to request the<br>
window manager to display the dialog.  This can be implemented in X as it<br>
is now, but every window manager will need to be rewritten to handle these<br>
exotic new clients.  Whereas it's okay for the WM to ignore Motif icons,<br>
the program will not function without a dialog it expects to be present.<br>
I was just thinking that since there are many things like this that<br>
*could* be done, and which probably ought to be done, so many things that<br>
traditional X does would break these, so there's not really any need to<br>
preserve backward compatibility.  I guess this isn't really true, though.<br>
Maybe I'm not talking about a new environment, but simply a major overhaul<br>
of what has been the "X windowing system".  I'm sure that at the protocol<br>
level X is probably mostly stable.  However, I'm also willing to bet that<br>
there are some simple optimizations that could be performed as well.<br>
Could they be done while preserving compatibility?  I don't know.<br>

<p>
Maybe yes and maybe no.  Right now there's actually even an additional<br>
layer of configuration options.  Has anyone used the latest E? <br>
(www.enlightenment.org)  I haven't - I don't even know if it will compile<br>
on the Alpha, but the big introduction there is GTK+ "themes".  So even<br>
within your single window manager, you can redefine buttons and other<br>
various widgets.  I'm assuming this only works with GTK+, but that's<br>
essentially an abstracted (or "widgetless") widget set. <br>
<p>
In my opinion, I think that what E is doing is a better solution than what<br>
has been done in the past, but that comes at the expense of bloat, etc,<br>
etc.  No, overall I like the concept of X, there's just some issues<br>
regarding the internals (mostly how optimized it is) and then resource<br>
management.<br>

I'll agree; C++ has some "slickness" that is good for inexperienced<br>
programmers not used to memory management, etc.  But I don't like the idea<br>
of simply abondoning C for something that should be as integral to unix as<br>
windows is to DOS.<br>
<p>
In light of this, remember that my subject line is the "New" X, not the<br>
replacement for X.  :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I never said it was.  And I think Windows is just as bad under 8 bits as X.</i><br>
<p>
How could you possibly say that??  Under windows I can open Netscape and a<br>
graphics viewer and a photoshop on an 8 bit display with virtually no<br>
significant loss of color-isms.  Under X, open netscape, xv, and the gimp.<br>
Can you really say these are equal?  I either get warnings about unable to<br>
allocate color cells or the program simply refuses to load or the display<br>
flashes when I move in and out of windows.  Maybe you have a better X<br>
server than I do, but this is true of XFree on Intel, Sparc, and Alpha and<br>
on vanilla X for SunOS/Solaris on Sparc, and OpenWindows on SunOS/Sparc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Does X-Free even support the printing extensions?  I know they don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; support multiheadedness (yet?)...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's hard to do printing in an operating system independant way.</i><br>
<p>
Very true - the actual printing.  But look for example at NeWSPrint.<br>
Basically if I understand it right, what you draw on the "screen" becomes<br>
postscript, which can then be saved/printed/whatever.  In opposition to<br>
each program having to write its own PS driver.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As for multi-headedness, I used to have a two headed VaxStation GPX running</i><br>
<i>&gt; two heads on X10!  I'd be real suprised if X11 doesn't do it.</i><br>
<p>
X11 does, yes, sorry.  XFree does not.  I'm assuming here that everyone is<br>
running XFree on their Alpha/Linux boxes.  I'm simply using my Solaris<br>
examples to show that it is not a XFree-only affliction.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Programmatically, you can force a value to not be overridable, or to set</i><br>
<i>&gt; defaults that can be overridden by the database.  If you arrange the</i><br>
<i>&gt; XAPPLRESDIR path and permissions on the directories correctly, you can have</i><br>
<i>&gt; all sorts of control over what's overridable and what's not.  For instance,</i><br>
<p>
But users can modify their XAPPLRESDIR.  There's simply no absolute way.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Does xrdb notify the clients of the changes?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No, but then again you don't have to reboot the whole damn machine every time</i><br>
<i>&gt; you make a change to the database like you do with so many windows programs.</i><br>
<p>
I agree completely with you here - but simply because one method is better<br>
than an existing method does not mean that the method is the best.  If<br>
there is room for improvement, that change should be made.  Nothing is<br>
going to stand still when it can improve over something that's "better". <br>
NT, for example, rarely needs to be rebooted when doing "normal" things<br>
like changing IP netmasks, etc.  Yet X doesn't have the ability to change<br>
a default background and have the applications accept the changes, whereas<br>
Windows does.  All I'm saying is that there is room for improvement.  And<br>
I don't know that the existing X mechanisms are sufficient and/or could be<br>
upgraded without breking previous apps. <br>

<p>
Absolutely true.  All I meant to say that was if it wasn't really possible<br>
to preserve the backwardness of X, that effort should not be expended or<br>
"Y" be hobbled to compensate.  Every now and again there has to be a clean<br>
break from the past into the new.  Writing a translator shouldn't be that<br>
difficult as both systems are (would be) open source, and the X shouldn't<br>
be any worse-off than current X, just not as efficient as the newer "Y".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The registry notion isn't *all* that bad; the fact that Microsoft has</i><br>
<i>&gt; shown us a ludicrously poor implementation of the idea does not</i><br>
<i>&gt; invalidate it altogether. </i><br>
<p>
Maybe you are right, but I've never met a registry I liked.  Personally, I<br>
think the "benefits" are far outweighted by the risks.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Having a DBMS for configuration information has some merit:</i><br>
<i>&gt; - It allows one to avoid parsing configuration files</i><br>
<p>
If the parsing is done by the toolkit, it doesn't matter.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; - It may allow, with suitable indexing, O(1) access to values of interest </i><br>
<i>&gt; rather than O(size of config file)</i><br>
<p>
Even in the '386 days, this was never a major obstacle.  And today, on our<br>
zippy litle UDBs, the difference is that between waiting .3 seconds versus<br>
.02 seconds - an over tenfold increase, but still neglible. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; - It provides a common place to stick somewhat random stuff.</i><br>
<p>
Not a benefit.  If there are just standards for the .config files the same<br>
could be said of that.  For instance, global fixed defaults; global<br>
defaults; and user defaults in ~/.Xdefaults/app-name, where the<br>
application has complete control over only that single file.  The only<br>
real problem with what exists now is that there's no way to save settings.<br>
Again, all of this should be implemented in the toolkit.  And again, not<br>
all toolkits support this, so they will have to be rewritten ...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; - With a suitable transaction processing scheme it can provide a high</i><br>
<i>&gt; level of robustness</i><br>
<p>
And this would eat away much of the performance gained by storing it in an<br>
indexed database. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And of course there are demerits:</i><br>
<i>&gt; - You need some special tools to get at the data rather than grep, vi and sed</i><br>
<p>
This is very bad.  It's very not-unix.  In fact, it's 100% not-unix.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; - If abused, it just turns into a big bundle of meaningless crap.</i><br>
<p>
There are many circumstances under which it becomes meaningless crap. <br>
Abuse is one - disk error is another.  Is it a standalone database with<br>
its own daemon?  What happens when this crashes and transactions aren't<br>
completely fully?  What if you accidentally put garbage into the database?<br>
To me, it just seems like a lot of unneeded headaches, and I think that it<br>
what it eventually becomes.  It's much easier to deal with single files<br>
that can be removed when an application is removed, rather than having a<br>
database with 15 years of application data still stored after the app has<br>
been removed.  And then that data adds to the overhead of reading and<br>
writing settings whereas the file-for-app method would never even worry<br>
about it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Java has the merit that there are some big people standing behind it. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sun is not the important "player;" *IBM* is. </i><br>
<p>
Sun is an extremely important player because they control the language.<br>
Sun can't make Java succeed, but they can surely kill it.  Recent actions<br>
by Sun reinforce this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A significant problem with X as it is now is that there are altogether</i><br>
<i>&gt; too many places where settings can come from.  In effect, it's too</i><br>
<i>&gt; flexible to be usable. </i><br>
<p>
To an extent, yes.  I advocate only a more precisely defined mechnism,<br>
preferrably maintained by the toolkits and with a common client API.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But if it's not nicely backwards compatible, you'll immediately break huge </i><br>
<i>&gt; quantities of things that function (such as they do) now.</i><br>
<p>
Sure - only having an X server that runs under this incompatible<br>
environment should not be a big deal.  eXceed does it for windows and<br>
there's no reason that two open source projects (especially if the latter<br>
is based heavily on the former) can't interoperate with a similar<br>
translation layer.  Should it be an integral and transparent part?  I<br>
suppose it should.  Does it matter in the design?  Not really.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's not much good to have a new system that is regrettably incompatible</i><br>
<i>&gt; with *all* of the graphical applications that have been developed for</i><br>
<i>&gt; Linux, thus requiring that people reimplement all their graphical apps. </i><br>
<p>
But the object is to have them all reimplemented eventually.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The thought that I keep having is that the "right" way to create a new</i><br>
<i>&gt; system would be to step back to X11R4, whose code is available, works</i><br>
<i>&gt; (on some platforms), contains the vast majority of the functionality</i><br>
<i>&gt; that actually gets used in applications, and happens to be a tiny</i><br>
<i>&gt; fraction the size of X11R6, and try coding in a new direction. </i><br>
<p>
But then losing out on the XRX, LBX, and print extensions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This would be a similar thing to the Lesstif project, with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; difference that it wouldn't need to be coded from scratch.  Huge</i><br>
<i>&gt; quantities of code ought to be integratable from X11R6. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It probably becomes more realistic to consider something like this when</i><br>
<i>&gt; XFree86 4.0 comes out, as it appears that it will be more modular, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; should make it a bit easier to decompose the system for further</i><br>
<i>&gt; maintenance. </i><br>
<p>
XFree could very well be the method used to bring about this change.<br>
Maybe GNOME/GTK+ will be the method to get my desired window manager as<br>
comptroller changes.  Or maybe it'll end up being a huge complicated mess<br>
that even fewer people understand and will act as the impetus for change.<br>
Right now there's a huge influx of non-unix people with 28k modems who<br>
don't know much about X.  I'd like to think I know a bit about X but will<br>
be the first to admit I know, truly, very little.  They will want change<br>
and will drive changes, but I think it's important that these be forward<br>
changes.  I suppose there will always be people with the same objectives,<br>
but I think that time is getting short and that a lot of these little<br>
hacks to X are going to start to really bring it down.  MS is starting to<br>
realize that, as Sun has said, the Network is the Computer, and will be<br>
putting a lot of effort into this arena.  Can they do better than X?<br>
Maybe.  Can we do better?  Probably.  Who will be there first, and what<br>
will be the ramifications?<br>

I agree - I don't like filebrowsers or trashcans.  I do like KDE though.<br>
I like the consistency of the window manager, and I love it's color<br>
handling.  Okay, so no flicker on a 8-bit display, but it sucks all the<br>
colors out of the background.  I don't like its lack of configurability.<br>
(KDE uses the OpenWin "thumbtack" whereas I prefer my FVWM2 "sticky-bars"<br>
that go across the entire window titlebar.  KWM appears to have no such<br>
options.)  Hmm ... looking at the KDE config (~/.kde) it appears that I'm<br>
not alone in my config file thinking.  :)<br>
