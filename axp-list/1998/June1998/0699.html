<i>&gt; As Uncle George said, don't assume because the program came on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; CD it is working. The errata/updates are testimony to the fact it may not</i><br>
<i>&gt; work. There are many programs that have been fixed. I suspect RH5.1</i><br>
<i>&gt; will be significantly more stable than RH5.0. If you're looking for a more</i><br>
<i>&gt; trouble free install, use RH4.2. The problem though is the change in C</i><br>
<i>&gt; libraries. That's a major headache. Everything I have that did not come</i><br>
<i>&gt; with RH5.0, had to be recompiled to run on the new system. Not a</i><br>
<i>&gt; big deal to me but the average non-programmer would find that to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be a nightmare. I get the feeling you might not do alot of programming.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong. Using gdb is the standard way to find this</i><br>
<i>&gt; sort of problem. Even if the process is already running, you can use</i><br>
<i>&gt; gdb and use the 'attach' sub-command to hook up to it and see what</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's doing.</i><br>
<p>
This is correct.  I'm not much of a programmer.  I've learned some of thetricks to get<br>
those things that don't compile out of the box to do so, but<br>
beyond that I can't do much.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As far as SCSI usage goes, I use 2940UW and NCR810/875 adapters</i><br>
<i>&gt; in my systems. No more than 2 drives plus a tape drive though. Since it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; not just a single system having problems (assuming you all did your</i><br>
<i>&gt; installs independently) it seems unlikely to be a HW issue. If they all</i><br>
<i>&gt; are configured by the same person, the same way, it might be HW</i><br>
<i>&gt; though. How about scaling back to a single drive and running tests</i><br>
<i>&gt; to see if that works? Did you all use the same set of CD's to install</i><br>
<i>&gt; from? Got to be some common link in the systems.</i><br>
<p>
We are all geographically disperse people who have nothing in common exceptwe joined in<br>
on a thread that started over in the MySQL mailing list, and we all<br>
are getting this memory violation error.  Unfortunately, none of us are programmers,<br>
and we can't find anything else that is common to us.  I know I sound like I'm<br>
being dense about this, but it just seems like I shouldn't need to be learning things<br>
like gdb, etc., in order to install the OS, apply the errate RPMs, and compile<br>
Apache, QMail, IMAPd, and MySQL.  I think this is really quite a common<br>
setup, and I've not heard about these problems in more than a handful of sites.<br>
So, I'm assuming it is us and probably something about our hardware or our<br>
installation methods.<br>
<p>
Anyway, I'll quit bugging the list now.  Perhaps I'll see if I can get my vendor to send<br>
<p>
me a new system with RHL installed with the partitions the way I need them and then<br>
see what happens running the stuff on that system.  It just bugs me that we can't find a<br>
cause<br>
for this, because I know of about 15 Alphas that are being sent back to various vendors<br>
to be replaced by "stable" Intel machines.  I'd hate to see more go the same way.<br>
<p>
Thanks for everyone who helped, though!<br>
