All,<br>
<p>
    rather than just sign off this list an disappear into obscurity, I thought that I'd<br>
let you all know what's happening.  This Friday is my last Friday at Digital after<br>
13 years.  I work for the part of Digital Semiconductor that was bought by Intel<br>
last Autumn (Jim and Jay work for the part bought by Compaq).  This means that<br>
as the business transitions to Intel, I transition also.  As for Alpha, I've not been<br>
doing an awful lot of engineering, just keeping a watching brief.  Jay (surely one<br>
of the coolest guys on the planet) has picked up the mantle of MILO and done a<br>
good job.  Meanwhile, I've been playing with StrongARM - I run a group which<br>
generates tools and OS porting software for StrongARM.<br>
<p>
    I am not, as you might imagine, going to Intel.   Intel does no engineering in<br>
Europe (they are very US-centric).  No instead, I (and my group) are going to <br>
ARM in Maidenhead.  Basically we'll carry on doing what we were doing (and <br>
then some) but become less StrongARM-centric.  ARM's a lovely architecture<br>
('cept the memory management unit, but I'll not mention that) and the company<br>
has a good feel - I think that I'll enjoy it there.   I wish the StrongARM group <br>
well as they transition to Intel - I believe that Intel will do great things with<br>
StrongARM.<br>
<p>
    I also believe that the FTC announcement ensures the future of Alpha and<br>
that Maddog (another of the planet's coolest individuals) will continue to do that<br>
vision thing that he does so well.   One man (Maddog) with a long level (Linux)<br>
moved a big company (Digital, 65,000) - after that Compaq should be easy.<br>
<p>
    Meanwhile, Linux and Alpha Linux will continue to be part of my working and<br>
personal life.   All (and I mean all) of the StrongARM software that I have <br>
developed in the last two years was developed on my trusty PC164.  My home<br>
Cyrix box has also helped.  That will continue at ARM and ARM has a goodly<br>
number of Linux enthusiasts within it.  I also want to expand my involvement with<br>
the ARM Linux work being organised by Russell King.<br>
<p>
    So, so long and thanks for all of the fish.   I'll drop out of this list and then<br>
rejoin when I've got my compute environment set up at ARM.  My e-mail <br>
address is extremely likely to be <a href="mailto:david.rusling@arm.com">david.rusling@arm.com</a><br>
<p>
Ka'plaagh!         <br>
<p>
Dave<br>
