<i>&gt; Absolutely.  Additionally, it would have to better support low bandwidth</i><br>
<i>&gt; environments like 28.8k modems.  When X was designed, it was ethernet or</i><br>
<i>&gt; token ring or 1200 baud modems, and they figured it was futile to try to</i><br>
<i>&gt; make it run over 1200 baud (quite correctly, in fact).  However, in making</i><br>
<i>&gt; this decision they decided to forego and bandwith considerations at all.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The hack-on LBX extensions serve as a primary example.</i><br>
<p>
Many graphics operations are inherently bandwidth-intensive.  Even so, <br>
many simple optimizations can be made.  Xlib make no effort to cache useful<br>
information like window attributes for instance; it queries the server <br>
each time.<br>
<p>
The X libraries (and many existing applications) make little or no effort <br>
to conserve bandwidth.  The LBX extensions operate as a layer between the <br>
client and server, and make a best-effort to cache information.  It's not <br>
a bad idea and definitely not a "hack-on" effort.  (Consider HTTP proxy <br>
servers; they serve a similar purpose for the Web as LBX does for X.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; - portable as all hell</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Absolutely.  Much more judicous use of unions is needed.</i><br>
<p>
Definitely.  The X Consortium's sample code had a lot of <br>
portability problems.  The XFree86 team has tackled some of these,<br>
but needs much more help...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; - upwards compatible with X servers/clients.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not necessarily.  It will need a X server client of it's own (that is,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's own version of eXceed).</i><br>
<p>
??? I don't understand.  eXceed is a commercial X display server for Windows.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; - truely object oriented instead of the half-assed "objects in C" like Xt and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   Motif currently do.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Absolutely under no circumstances whatsoever.  ANSI-C *only*!  This is one</i><br>
<i>&gt; of my biggest gripes with the Berlin people.  The next is the registry.</i><br>
<p>
Good grief.  You don't expect to be able to provide a state-of-the-art API<br>
in ANSI-C only, do you?  That's how the X Consortium got into that <br>
Motif/Xt mess in the first place.<br>
<p>
You certainly can't expect C++/Java/Smalltalk programmers to have to code <br>
to an ANSI-C API.  There *should* be a vanilla-C API available.  There <br>
also should be good O-O API's available for those who need them.<br>
<p>
Whether the display server is written with ANSI-C is an implementation <br>
issue, and shouldn't be part of the specification.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; - Good support for accelerated hardware without cutting out "normal" hardware.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is the prototypical driver issue.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I think you could achieve something like this with a new API that still spoke</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; X protocol underneath, providing it wasn't any slower than raw X.  Implement</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it in C++ and Java to start, then turn it over to the community to do "my</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; favourite language" bindings.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I suppose Java is a possibility, but I'm a horrid C bigot.  I think it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; better to simply address the major failings of X and try to reimplement a</i><br>
<i>&gt; better option.  There's a lot of "Why X sucks" links out there as is for</i><br>
<i>&gt; me to go into the details here, but the biggest failing is in colormap</i><br>
<i>&gt; handling.  Run X in an 8-bit display sometime for a while.  Under Solaris</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyway, colors disappear in time.  Netscape (with the -install option)</i><br>
<i>&gt; eventually fades to a very monochromatic grey scheme.  Loading it without</i><br>
<i>&gt; -install means other programs won't run (like the GIMP).  And with</i><br>
<i>&gt; -install, there's colormap flashing, which really sucks when playing</i><br>
<i>&gt; xboing.  Frame Maker doesn't even have the -install option and appears</i><br>
<i>&gt; with no highlights or shadows - everything is just one big block.  KDE is</i><br>
<i>&gt; the most amazing window manager in this respect, but the problem persists.</i><br>
<p>
Many applications don't use the color models properly.  X supports <br>
pseudocolor, directcolor, truecolor, whatever... it tries hard to use the <br>
hardware resources as best as it can.  "Colormap flashing" is a reasonable<br>
compromise on displays that are starved for colors.<br>
<p>
Solaris's X server may be badly broken, I don't know.  I have one Sun box <br>
here; I can't run Netscape on the console (it dies with a bus error) but <br>
it runs fine from my PC with the free Microimages X server.<br>
<p>
Anyway, with video cards as cheap as they are nowadays, why should anyone <br>
be stuck with 8bpp color?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The next problem of X is the bandwidth.  X is virtually unusable across an</i><br>
<i>&gt; ISDN, and only marginally better across a T1.  A lot can be done here with</i><br>
<i>&gt; built-in proxies for, eg, window manager bitmaps, and at a minimum RLE</i><br>
<i>&gt; compression.  Now, I'm no X expert so I may be way off base here, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; another thing that would be nice is an event mask.  A lot of applications</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't care when the mouse moves over them - these don't need to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; transfered.  Neither do enter/exit messages.  Sad to say, but common</i><br>
<i>&gt; dialogs would also be nice - or at least a method of caching and</i><br>
<i>&gt; transferring fixed dialogs so the entire window doesn't have to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; transferred.</i><br>
<p>
There *is* an event mask.  Most applications don't utilize it, and accept<br>
all events (ignoring those it doesn't need).  Mouse motion is a big one.<br>
Run an xterm over a dialup, move your mouse and see if your modem lights<br>
blink.  They wont't.  BTW xterm is really quite useable over a dialup,<br>
because the author actually made an attempt to conserve bandwidth.<br>
<p>
This is yet another example of programmer laziness.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Then there's the font server.  Having a remote display uses the local font</i><br>
<i>&gt; server.  This is very confusing and can be quite a limitation.  I would</i><br>
<i>&gt; think that at a minimum the font servers should be able to query one</i><br>
<i>&gt; another.  Additionally, X should not hang when the font server does it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing.  I do think that whatever replaces X should be fully multithreaded,</i><br>
<i>&gt; even if that means less portability.  :(</i><br>
<p>
Font servers weren't intended to be local.  They are network resources.  <br>
They address the problem of having to distrubute fonts to each display <br>
server.  Unfortunately they are not widely implemented.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; These are my major gripes with X, but they are not ones that are easily</i><br>
<i>&gt; repairable - they are faults intrisic to the system.  However, a new</i><br>
<i>&gt; defaults mechanism is also needed.  There should, IMHO, be three</i><br>
<i>&gt; configuration files for each program - one in .../app-defaults, one in</i><br>
<i>&gt; .../app-defaults/fixed, and one in the user's home directory - just like</i><br>
<i>&gt; the setup for Pine.  There should be *NO* registry.</i><br>
<p>
&lt;sigh&gt; You admit you are not an X expert in one sentence, then claim the<br>
deficiencies in X cannot easily be repaired.  You are criticizing X from <br>
a user's point of view, not from its architecture.  The configuration <br>
files are just such an example.  Many portions of the X distribution are not <br>
great (Xt comes to mind), but they are optional and no application <br>
programmer has to use them...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To be honest, there are some things for X to learn from Windoze.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; WinFrame stuff is pretty efficient (of course, done so at the expense of</i><br>
<i>&gt; configurability, but nonetheless...)</i><br>
<p>
WinFrame is very expensive on the application server.  Try to connect 5 <br>
users to your WinFrame server, then 10, then 20.  Watch what happens to<br>
memory/CPU utilization.<br>
<p>
This claim is absurd.  What makes WinFrame over win32 a better hack than LBX?<br>
<p>
Instead of bashing X, why not think of real ways it can be fixed?  <br>
Starting over with a new window system from scratch is *not* the <br>
answer.  We need something that will be done before 2010...<br>
