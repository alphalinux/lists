<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I guess you are using a 2.0.x and a CONFIG_ALPHA_SRM_SETUP configuration. </i><br>
<i>&gt; The problem is currently fixed in the 2.1.x series.  You may choose one of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the following solutions: </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1. Disable CONFIG_ALPHA_SRM_SETUP.  You won't be able to halt/reboot</i><br>
<i>&gt; cleanly.  It will be OK from Linux's side: you will just have to type</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'init' within SRM after halt.  And you will see somewhat annoying</i><br>
<i>&gt; behaviour of reboot.  (Well, I suppose you observe this behaviour anyway,</i><br>
<i>&gt; as there is a small omission present in 2.0.33, which prevents</i><br>
<i>&gt; CONFIG_ALPHA_SRM_SETUP from having a positive impact on Avanti machines.) </i><br>
<i>&gt; ;-) </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2. Wait for 2.0.34 be released by Alan.  Hopefully Jay will survive an</i><br>
<i>&gt; extra overload caused by the need of preparing patches for Alpha/2.0.34</i><br>
<i>&gt; and they will finally appear on 'gatekeeper'.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 3. Use the current 2.1.x release -- 2.1.101 works for me but YMMV.</i><br>
<p>
Right now I'd settle for just finding out how avanti-s was compiled (what<br>
patches etc.). It works fine but needs to have a few more things compiled in.<br>
<p>
I don't know how long 2.0.34 will be and I don't know if it is a good idea to<br>
give my boss a developmental kernel, although I will probably try out 2.1.x at<br>
home. Does 2.1.101 work on an SX machine? I heard that the<br>
2.1.x series didn't work on the SX, but that was some time ago. Does 2.1.101<br>
need patching for the Alpha? I think I heard it did not.<br>
<p>
OTOH, if the vendors have some really great deals at LinuxExpo who knows what I<br>
may come home with :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Clearly the address is the problem. Again I wish I knew what RedHat did</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to get their kernel to work. I really hate it when they do something and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; do not document it or make the source they used available, Isn't this</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; what the GPL is supposed to prevent? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Apparently, you did not use the RH's kernel but the one from</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'gatekeeper'.  Or did RH apply that patch finally?</i><br>
<p>
I'm pretty sure I got it from RH. I also recall a mention on this list that the<br>
"-s" was from the "clever gnomes at RH" and meant it was for use with SRM.<br>
<p>
The kernels I compile that do not work properly are from 2.0.33 sources with<br>
alpha-patches-2.0.32 applied. Are there other patches I should have applied?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I'm also booting from the SRM console and the SRM PCI support is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; labelled as "new". I may try blowing ARC into the flash and booting from</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that although I don't see why that should matter since my other PCI</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; stuff like scsi works fine. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I wouldn't do that.  ARC is not so nice as SRM and also it prints that</i><br>
<i>&gt; nasty "Copyright Microsoft...".  SCSI works by accident -- the IRQ route</i><br>
<i>&gt; happens to be correct for this slot.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Thanks for the note, I think the 0x10100 address you reported is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; significant to me. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  It just hints that SRM PCI configuration is in use -- Linux does not set</i><br>
<i>&gt; up devices in such a way because, the I/O space on Intels is limited to 64</i><br>
<i>&gt; kB.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  BTW, cc to axp-list as others may be interested, too.</i><br>
<p>
I usually do, but I've put a lot of traffic about this problem on the list and<br>
I figured I would wait 'till I get it figured out and then post a summary -<br>
more or less the way the Sun-Managers and the Alpha-OSF lists work. I probably<br>
wouldn't have made that crack about the GPL in a list message :-)<br>
<p>
Much thanks for your input.<br>
