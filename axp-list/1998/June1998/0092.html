<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; - upwards compatible with X servers/clients.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Not necessarily.  It will need a X server client of it's own (that is,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it's own version of eXceed).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm confused.  You mean a client that runs on an X server that implements a</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Y" server?  Because you'd need some way to make sure the thousands of X</i><br>
<p>
Nope - it will need a program that runs under "Y", that *is* an X server.<br>
This would allow X clients to talk to the X server, which is itself a "Y"<br>
client.  Just like eXceed is an X server for "Y"indows.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; clients still run, and you'd also hopefully want to still run on all those X</i><br>
<i>&gt; servers out there.  Do I have to mention my NCD X-terminal here?</i><br>
<p>
Your X server would be obsolesed.  It would still run X programs, but not<br>
"Y" programs.  Unless, of course, someone wrote a "Y" server for X.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Absolutely under no circumstances whatsoever.  ANSI-C *only*!  This is one</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of my biggest gripes with the Berlin people.  The next is the registry.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Registrys are for idiots, but I disagree entirely about OO.  There are a lot</i><br>
<i>&gt; of things that OO does really badly, but windowing systems is one of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; things it's good for.</i><br>
<p>
I do not discount the benefit of OO - as long as you do not discount the<br>
bloat (at least of C++).  I like the whole OO *idea*, but the<br>
implementation thus far is relatively poor.  That's why I don't mind so<br>
much the idea of Java.  It is a decent language.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Xt is a half-assed attempt to do OO in C.  It's not bad, but I've seen better.</i><br>
<p>
Well, if it's not bad, it's still usable.  The same could be said that X<br>
is not bad, and I don't mean to throw out all of X, I'm sure a lot of code<br>
could be reused, but a distinct portion (if not majority) is severly<br>
lacking.  This is not the same for C, though.  C does OO "relatively" well<br>
for a proceedural language, and I see no reason to throw this out.  Most<br>
*nix code is C, and there's no need to do C++-isms when you can strongly<br>
type the structs to be so closely OO-like.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; me to go into the details here, but the biggest failing is in colormap</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But I think that's an API problem, rather than a problem with the underlying</i><br>
<i>&gt; protocol.</i><br>
<p>
API?  It is an intrinsic problem of colormap handling, which is so poor it<br>
can't even be classified as half-assed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; handling.  Run X in an 8-bit display sometime for a while.  Under Solaris</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; anyway, colors disappear in time.  Netscape (with the -install option)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I run an 8-bit display all the time (UDB with TGA, remember?)</i><br>
<p>
No.  :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A lot of programmers aren't very good at managing public and private</i><br>
<i>&gt; colormaps, and so they consume the whole colormap pretty fast.  I have</i><br>
<i>&gt; strategies for that (mostly avoiding running Netscape until *after* running</i><br>
<i>&gt; anything color intensive).</i><br>
<p>
But that's not really a solution.  Windows runs decent in 4-bit color.<br>
8-bit color is marvelous.  Under X, 8-bit is a bare minumum and even then<br>
you have to put up with colormap flashing.  Admit it, it's horrible.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; The next problem of X is the bandwidth.  X is virtually unusable across an</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, you've already mentioned LBX.  I think it's good that X is extenisible</i><br>
<i>&gt; in order to add stuff like that, and still remain backwards compatible.</i><br>
<p>
Extensibility is fundamental, but the X "extension" method itself is a bit<br>
of a hack.  Another problem is with printing which has also been addressed<br>
in recent versions of X, but these are truly hack-ons, and not part of<br>
what should be integral.<br>
<p>
Does X-Free even support the printing extensions?  I know they don't<br>
support multiheadedness (yet?)...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; defaults mechanism is also needed.  There should, IMHO, be three</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; configuration files for each program - one in .../app-defaults, one in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; .../app-defaults/fixed, and one in the user's home directory - just like</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the setup for Pine.  There should be *NO* registry.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That sounds pretty much like the standard set-up to me.  Just set up the</i><br>
<i>&gt; system wide XAPPLRESDIR, and you're golden.</i><br>
<p>
I should explain.  :)<br>
<p>
The three files would be:<br>
  ../app-defaults/fixed   - settings that can never be overriden<br>
  ../app-defaults         - default settings that may be overriden<br>
  ~/.                     - user overrides<br>
<p>
This was most benficial in Pine where the domain name can be fixed and not<br>
changed by users under any circumstances.  I'm not sure if any other<br>
programs need it except maybe xscreen{saver,lock} but if the file doesn't<br>
exist, then it simply falls back to compile-time options.<br>
<p>
But it is pretty much in place.  The only thing I add is the "fixed" file.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; To be honest, there are some things for X to learn from Windoze.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; WinFrame stuff is pretty efficient (of course, done so at the expense of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; configurability, but nonetheless...)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The MAIN thing I hate about Windows is the lack of an equivalent to the X</i><br>
<i>&gt; Resource Database.</i><br>
<p>
Does xrdb notify the clients of the changes?<br>
<p>
There's just a few integration issues that are missing ... XFree allows<br>
you to change resolutions without restarting, but what about color depth?<br>
I guess it's the color thing that's most notably problematic.  Aside from<br>
that, a more efficient protocol.  I just don't think that X in its current<br>
form would be able to handle all the changes needed to bring it up to<br>
date.  Maybe X12 is "the answer", but I would argue that just as likely a<br>
new windowing system could be built to succeed X11.<br>
<p>
I think, for instance, that some commonality would be benficial, like<br>
common dialog boxes.  However, I would say that these need to be put in<br>
the window manager, but you need the back-end support from the client.<br>
<p>
I don't know ... getting too tired to think.<br>
