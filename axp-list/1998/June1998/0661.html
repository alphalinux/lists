I'm trying to port the Packet Engines "Gigabit Ethernet" card to<br>
AXP/Linux, using Donald Becker's "yellowfin" driver for this card.<br>
<p>
The problems I'm having don't seem to be related to the driver, I've<br>
been up and down it's code which looks good (but I don't know the<br>
assumptions of the board itself):<br>
<p>
1) Programs with lots of floating point code die randomly with<br>
floating point exceptions when the network is at peak load (running<br>
netperfs and such).<br>
<p>
2) The interrupt handlers, in general, seem to be getting re-entered,<br>
even though interrupts are disabled.<br>
<p>
3) The yellowfin drivers stops responding, and needs to be<br>
rmmod/insmod to get it going again.<br>
<p>
So, starting off with an explanation of "1)", above:<br>
<p>
I can transmit UDP packets (using netperf as a test) all night long<br>
from an Alpha to an Intel (both with yellowfin boards), without any<br>
problems.<br>
<p>
If I run TCP tests, or receive UDP packets (via netperf) on an Alpha,<br>
then this will run all night long too... as long as I don't start up<br>
other programs.  With other programs running, they die randomly (at<br>
many places within their code) with floating point exceptions. <br>
Without a yellowfin card, these programs run without error.<br>
<p>
I saw something similar once, running VxWorks on an Axp, where you had<br>
to set a mask of the register sets to be swapped with a thread you<br>
were invoking.  If the thread had FP calculations, and you didn't set<br>
the flag that indicated "swap the FP registers", then under high load,<br>
the task would swap out in the middle of an FP operation, the FP regs<br>
wouldn't be swapped out, when the task was swapped back in, the FP<br>
unit had to deal with whatever junk was in the FP registers in the<br>
middle of an operation, and the thread would often throw a FP<br>
exception from a random (different every time) program location.<br>
<p>
Then again, we are dealing with a bus-mastering device, which could<br>
write to any memory location without getting trapped, and it could<br>
just be randomly bombing memory.<br>
<p>
Any ideas on what is causing this?  Anybody know how the kernel swaps<br>
FP regs with a task?<br>
<p>
On to "2)", above:<br>
<p>
I see this with or without the yellowfin card.  I've instrumented the<br>
kernel in linux/arch/alpha/kernel/irq.c, the routine<br>
"cabriolet_and_eb66p_device_interrupt" such that it has the basic<br>
structure:<br>
                                                       struct pt_regs<br>
* regs)<br>
{<br>
        unsigned long flags;<br>
        static int reentry=0;<br>
<p>
        save_flags(flags);<br>
        cli();<br>
<p>
        if (reentry) {<br>
      		printk("Reentry detected\n");<br>
  	}<br>
        reentry = 1;<br>
<p>
/* the body of the code */<br>
<p>
        reentry = 0;<br>
        restore_flags(flags);<br>
}     <br>
<p>
The "reentry" flag should never be found to be set.  But it is.  I've<br>
found drivers erroneously using "sti()" (which raises the IPL to user<br>
level) in the middle of an interrupt routine.  Replacing their "sti"<br>
with the flag save and restore has removed problems with these<br>
drivers.<br>
<p>
But, when I look thru the kernel source, there's probably about 50<br>
files still using "sti" (mostly disk and net drivers).  In the network<br>
core code, I modified about 20 files to "do it right".  Of these,<br>
"route.c" and "af_inet.c" had some pretty strange "sti's" in them, and<br>
I had to leave them the way they were for the machine to boot properly<br>
(there was one "sti" with no corresponding "cli").<br>
<p>
Anyway, these changes didn't make any difference.  I still see<br>
"Reentry detected" occasionally, mostly when X is starting and when I<br>
reload the yellowfin driver.<br>
<p>
When is it appropriate to call "sti" on an Alpha?  When is it<br>
appropriate to re-enter the above routine?<br>
<p>
On to point "3)", above:<br>
<p>
When I'm running Netperf's "netserver", receiving UDP packets from an<br>
Intel host across a yellowfin driver, when I increase the system load<br>
(i.e. start running many continuously calculating FFT's, that<br>
occasionally have random FP exceptions), the netperf transfers stop<br>
and don't restart.  The sender eventually times out saying it lost<br>
contact with the receiver. <br>
<p>
At this point, I can't ping into or out of the AXP system. <br>
<p>
If I remove the yellowfin module, then reinstall it, the<br>
communications start back up (without restarting Netperf's "netserver"<br>
or the sender on the Intel side).  The Yellowfin driver is supposed to<br>
timeout and restart itself if it goes too long without receiving a<br>
packet.  This timeout code is not getting called.<br>
<p>
Either the yellowfin thinks it's OK, or the timeout mechanism isn't<br>
working.<br>
<p>
Any ideas on how to debug this?<br>
<p>
I'm running RedHat 5.0 (Kernel rev 2.0.30), using the egcs 1.0<br>
compiler, on a Digital PC164, 500MHZ, 128MB RAM.<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
