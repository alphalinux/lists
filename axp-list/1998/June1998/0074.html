<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - upwards compatible with X servers/clients.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Not necessarily.  It will need a X server client of it's own (that is,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; it's own version of eXceed).</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I'm confused.  You mean a client that runs on an X server that implements a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "Y" server?  Because you'd need some way to make sure the thousands of X</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Nope - it will need a program that runs under "Y", that *is* an X server.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This would allow X clients to talk to the X server, which is itself a "Y"</i><br>
<i>&gt; client.  Just like eXceed is an X server for "Y"indows.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; clients still run, and you'd also hopefully want to still run on all those </i><br>
X<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; servers out there.  Do I have to mention my NCD X-terminal here?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Your X server would be obsolesed.  It would still run X programs, but not</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Y" programs.  Unless, of course, someone wrote a "Y" server for X.</i><br>
<p>
This being rather unfortunate.  There's still a remarkable amount of useful <br>
old hardware out there.<br>
<p>
If you obsolete equipment, then there will be a proportion of people that will <br>
reject your "cool" Y server.  If it at least provides a "translator server" <br>
that would be a "proxy" that would allow supporting X11R5 servers, even with <br>
somewhat degraded performance, that would be better than nothing.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Absolutely under no circumstances whatsoever.  ANSI-C *only*!  This is on</i><br>
e<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; of my biggest gripes with the Berlin people.  The next is the registry.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Registrys are for idiots, but I disagree entirely about OO.  There are a lo</i><br>
t<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of things that OO does really badly, but windowing systems is one of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; things it's good for.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I do not discount the benefit of OO - as long as you do not discount the</i><br>
<i>&gt; bloat (at least of C++).  I like the whole OO *idea*, but the</i><br>
<i>&gt; implementation thus far is relatively poor.  That's why I don't mind so</i><br>
<i>&gt; much the idea of Java.  It is a decent language.</i><br>
<p>
The registry notion isn't *all* that bad; the fact that Microsoft has shown us <br>
a ludicrously poor implementation of the idea does not invalidate it <br>
altogether.<br>
<p>
Having a DBMS for configuration information has some merit:<br>
- It allows one to avoid parsing configuration files<br>
- It may allow, with suitable indexing, O(1) access to values of interest <br>
rather than O(size of config file)<br>
- It provides a common place to stick somewhat random stuff.<br>
- With a suitable transaction processing scheme it can provide a high level of <br>
robustness<br>
<p>
And of course there are demerits:<br>
- You need some special tools to get at the data rather than grep, vi and sed<br>
- If abused, it just turns into a big bundle of meaningless crap.<br>
<p>
Java has the merit that there are some big people standing behind it.  Sun is <br>
not the important "player;" *IBM* is.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Xt is a half-assed attempt to do OO in C.  It's not bad, but I've seen bett</i><br>
er.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, if it's not bad, it's still usable.  The same could be said that X</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not bad, and I don't mean to throw out all of X, I'm sure a lot of code</i><br>
<i>&gt; could be reused, but a distinct portion (if not majority) is severly</i><br>
<i>&gt; lacking.  This is not the same for C, though.  C does OO "relatively" well</i><br>
<i>&gt; for a proceedural language, and I see no reason to throw this out.  Most</i><br>
<i>&gt; *nix code is C, and there's no need to do C++-isms when you can strongly</i><br>
<i>&gt; type the structs to be so closely OO-like.</i><br>
<p>
Fair enough...  The important pieces of "object oriented programming" have <br>
more to do with the thinking processes than they do with the language features.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; me to go into the details here, but the biggest failing is in colormap</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; But I think that's an API problem, rather than a problem with the underlyin</i><br>
g<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; protocol.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; API?  It is an intrinsic problem of colormap handling, which is so poor it</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't even be classified as half-assed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; handling.  Run X in an 8-bit display sometime for a while.  Under Solaris</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; anyway, colors disappear in time.  Netscape (with the -install option)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I run an 8-bit display all the time (UDB with TGA, remember?)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No.  :)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A lot of programmers aren't very good at managing public and private</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; colormaps, and so they consume the whole colormap pretty fast.  I have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; strategies for that (mostly avoiding running Netscape until *after* running</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; anything color intensive).</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But that's not really a solution.  Windows runs decent in 4-bit color.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 8-bit color is marvelous.  Under X, 8-bit is a bare minumum and even then</i><br>
<i>&gt; you have to put up with colormap flashing.  Admit it, it's horrible.</i><br>
<p>
That's what you get for starting out with genericity as a primary design <br>
parameter.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; The next problem of X is the bandwidth.  X is virtually unusable across a</i><br>
n<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Well, you've already mentioned LBX.  I think it's good that X is extenisibl</i><br>
e<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in order to add stuff like that, and still remain backwards compatible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Extensibility is fundamental, but the X "extension" method itself is a bit</i><br>
<i>&gt; of a hack.  Another problem is with printing which has also been addressed</i><br>
<i>&gt; in recent versions of X, but these are truly hack-ons, and not part of</i><br>
<i>&gt; what should be integral.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Does X-Free even support the printing extensions?  I know they don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; support multiheadedness (yet?)...</i><br>
<p>
There have been some rumours coming out on what XFree86 4.0 is about; it looks <br>
like it is to be a substantially more modular system.  This should help in <br>
allowing extensions to be closer to being "first class members."<br>
<p>
Mind you, it's vaporware thus far, so we'll see what really happens Real Soon <br>
Now.  Hopefully in 1998...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; defaults mechanism is also needed.  There should, IMHO, be three</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; configuration files for each program - one in .../app-defaults, one in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; .../app-defaults/fixed, and one in the user's home directory - just like</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; the setup for Pine.  There should be *NO* registry.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; That sounds pretty much like the standard set-up to me.  Just set up the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; system wide XAPPLRESDIR, and you're golden.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I should explain.  :)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The three files would be:</i><br>
<i>&gt;   ../app-defaults/fixed   - settings that can never be overriden</i><br>
<i>&gt;   ../app-defaults         - default settings that may be overriden</i><br>
<i>&gt;   ~/.                     - user overrides</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This was most benficial in Pine where the domain name can be fixed and not</i><br>
<i>&gt; changed by users under any circumstances.  I'm not sure if any other</i><br>
<i>&gt; programs need it except maybe xscreen{saver,lock} but if the file doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; exist, then it simply falls back to compile-time options.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But it is pretty much in place.  The only thing I add is the "fixed" file.</i><br>
<p>
A significant problem with X as it is now is that there are altogether too <br>
many places where settings can come from.  In effect, it's too flexible to be <br>
usable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; To be honest, there are some things for X to learn from Windoze.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; WinFrame stuff is pretty efficient (of course, done so at the expense of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; configurability, but nonetheless...)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The MAIN thing I hate about Windows is the lack of an equivalent to the X</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Resource Database.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Does xrdb notify the clients of the changes?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There's just a few integration issues that are missing ... XFree allows</i><br>
<i>&gt; you to change resolutions without restarting, but what about color depth?</i><br>
<i>&gt; I guess it's the color thing that's most notably problematic.  Aside from</i><br>
<i>&gt; that, a more efficient protocol.  I just don't think that X in its current</i><br>
<i>&gt; form would be able to handle all the changes needed to bring it up to</i><br>
<i>&gt; date.  Maybe X12 is "the answer", but I would argue that just as likely a</i><br>
<i>&gt; new windowing system could be built to succeed X11.</i><br>
<p>
But if it's not nicely backwards compatible, you'll immediately break huge <br>
quantities of things that function (such as they do) now.<br>
<p>
It's not much good to have a new system that is regrettably incompatible with <br>
*all* of the graphical applications that have been developed for Linux, thus <br>
requiring that people reimplement all their graphical apps.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think, for instance, that some commonality would be benficial, like</i><br>
<i>&gt; common dialog boxes.  However, I would say that these need to be put in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the window manager, but you need the back-end support from the client.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't know ... getting too tired to think.</i><br>
<p>
The thought that I keep having is that the "right" way to create a new system <br>
would be to step back to X11R4, whose code is available, works (on some <br>
platforms), contains the vast majority of the functionality that actually gets <br>
used in applications, and happens to be a tiny fraction the size of X11R6, and <br>
try coding in a new direction.<br>
<p>
This would be a similar thing to the Lesstif project, with the difference that <br>
it wouldn't need to be coded from scratch.  Huge quantities of code ought to <br>
be integratable from X11R6.<br>
<p>
It probably becomes more realistic to consider something like this when <br>
XFree86 4.0 comes out, as it appears that it will be more modular, which <br>
should make it a bit easier to decompose the system for further maintenance.<br>
