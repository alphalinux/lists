Quoting Christopher Curtis (<a href="mailto:ccurtis@ee.fit.edu">ccurtis@ee.fit.edu</a>):<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I'm confused.  You mean a client that runs on an X server that implements a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "Y" server?  Because you'd need some way to make sure the thousands of X</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Nope - it will need a program that runs under "Y", that *is* an X server.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This would allow X clients to talk to the X server, which is itself a "Y"</i><br>
<i>&gt; client.  Just like eXceed is an X server for "Y"indows.</i><br>
<p>
Ok, same idea, different direction.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I do not discount the benefit of OO - as long as you do not discount the</i><br>
<i>&gt; bloat (at least of C++).  I like the whole OO *idea*, but the</i><br>
<i>&gt; implementation thus far is relatively poor.  That's why I don't mind so</i><br>
<i>&gt; much the idea of Java.  It is a decent language.</i><br>
<p>
I've been doing C++ full time for the last 4 years (until I switched to Java a<br>
few months ago).  I happened to like the language, as long as you were<br>
selective about which parts of the language you used.  Same with Java - it's a<br>
very nice language, but feature creep is getting to it and allowing people to<br>
do some *very* horrible stuff (like over using anonymous inner classes and the<br>
like).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; for a proceedural language, and I see no reason to throw this out.  Most</i><br>
<i>&gt; *nix code is C, and there's no need to do C++-isms when you can strongly</i><br>
<i>&gt; type the structs to be so closely OO-like.</i><br>
<p>
Well, I started with C++ back in the days when cfront took your C++ code and<br>
produced C with a boatload of funnily named structs with function pointers in<br>
them.<br>
<p>
If you're going to do OO in C, you end up with something similar - Not<br>
horrible, but it looks a little nicer in C++.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; colormaps, and so they consume the whole colormap pretty fast.  I have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; strategies for that (mostly avoiding running Netscape until *after* running</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; anything color intensive).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But that's not really a solution.  Windows runs decent in 4-bit color.</i><br>
<p>
I never said it was.  And I think Windows is just as bad under 8 bits as X.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Does X-Free even support the printing extensions?  I know they don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; support multiheadedness (yet?)...</i><br>
<p>
It's hard to do printing in an operating system independant way.<br>
As for multi-headedness, I used to have a two headed VaxStation GPX running<br>
two heads on X10!  I'd be real suprised if X11 doesn't do it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I should explain.  :)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The three files would be:</i><br>
<i>&gt;   ../app-defaults/fixed   - settings that can never be overriden</i><br>
<i>&gt;   ../app-defaults         - default settings that may be overriden</i><br>
<i>&gt;   ~/.                     - user overrides</i><br>
<p>
Programmatically, you can force a value to not be overridable, or to set<br>
defaults that can be overridden by the database.  If you arrange the<br>
XAPPLRESDIR path and permissions on the directories correctly, you can have<br>
all sorts of control over what's overridable and what's not.  For instance,<br>
make the ../app-defaults/fixed NFS mounted read-only so that only the system<br>
administrator can change it on a site-wide basis, make the ../app-defaults<br>
directory only writable by the local machine owner, and ~/.Xdefaults writable<br>
by the user.  If you make the "fixed" directory come last in the XAPPLRESDIR<br>
path, it will override anything the users override.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; The MAIN thing I hate about Windows is the lack of an equivalent to the X</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Resource Database.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Does xrdb notify the clients of the changes?</i><br>
<p>
No, but then again you don't have to reboot the whole damn machine every time<br>
you make a change to the database like you do with so many windows programs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There's just a few integration issues that are missing ... XFree allows</i><br>
<i>&gt; you to change resolutions without restarting, but what about color depth?</i><br>
<p>
XFree, probably not.  X does - on SGI I used to have my display set to 8 bit<br>
pseudo colour, but the application I was working on was 24 bit TrueColor.  We<br>
used to force the customers to start their X server as 24 bit TrueColor, but<br>
they wanted to run another application that forced them to start their server<br>
as 32 bit, so it was either lose an important customer or fix our application<br>
to set the visual type for the individual windows.  Guess which one I did?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think, for instance, that some commonality would be benficial, like</i><br>
<i>&gt; common dialog boxes.  However, I would say that these need to be put in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the window manager, but you need the back-end support from the client.</i><br>
<p>
Possibly.  Especially if they can be cached on the server like pixmaps are.<br>
But not if it would mean that your server forced you into a single<br>
look-and-feel.  Being able to run different window managers and different<br>
upper level apis (Motif, athena, raw Xt) is both a blessing and a curse of X.<br>
Mostly a blessing, I think.<br>
