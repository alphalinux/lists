	For all of you that are worred about Compaq killing the Alpha<br>
line, here is some encouragement. This is straight from a Digital Customer<br>
Representive, so it is true!<br>
<p>
	PS. This was sent originally to a number of big Digital customers,<br>
with no statement that I couldn't resend it, so hopefull I am not breaking<br>
any rules here... :) But it sounded so encouraging (and full what is<br>
probably public knowledge for those at the UNIX Executive Summit), that I<br>
had to pass it on. <br>

In a series of five short but poignant speeches delivered at the UNIX<br>
Executive Summit held in New York City, May 4-6, attendees heard from<br>
the CEOs of three of the IT industry's heaviest hitters -- DIGITAL's Bob<br>
Palmer, Compaq's Eckhard Pfeiffer and Oracle's Larry Ellison -- and two<br>
high-powered UNIX-based companies, Netscape and Commerzbank.  The net<br>
result: there is no question that DIGITAL UNIX  is well positioned to<br>
become the de facto industry standard UNIX for enterprise-level 64-bit<br>
computing in the new millennia. Additionally, there is no question<br>
Compaq will drive Alpha to become an open, industry-standard 64-bit<br>
architecture.<br>
<p>
Any lingering doubt about these facts was erased last Tuesday.  Look at<br>
these quotes. <br>
<p>
When a member of the press asked Eckhard Pfeiffer point blank,  "Are you<br>
saying that DIGITAL UNIX is going to be Compaq's 64-bit UNIX strategic<br>
platform?"  Pfeiffer replied, simply, "The answer is, YES.<br>
<p>
Pfeiffer made it clear how he feels about Alpha when he said, "I believe<br>
we can establish Alpha as an industry standard, building on DIGITAL's<br>
Alpha licensing agreements with Intel and Samsung... and its proposed<br>
agreement with AMD.  In fact, I think customers can buy Alpha systems<br>
today with renewed confidence in Alpha's long-term future."<br>
<p>
When asked if Compaq would continue to support OpenVMS.  Pfeiffer said,<br>
"We will continue to support OpenVMS as long as customers want it."<br>
<p>
THESE ARE STRONG STATEMENTS OF COMPAQ'S COMMITMENT TO DIGITAL<br>
TECHNOLOGY.  IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL THAT WE CONVEY THEM, AND THE OTHER<br>
GREAT STATEMENTS MADE AT THE EVENT, TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS --<br>
IMMEDIATELY!<br>
<p>
To resounding applause, Larry Ellison, Oracle Chairman and CEO,<br>
powerfully announced that, using an Oracle application, DIGITAL has<br>
achieved a record breaking TPC-C benchmark result for a large-scale<br>
AlphaServer 8400 5/625 cluster. The test recorded a tpmC figure of<br>
102,541.85 - which is almost double the previous best-performing system,<br>
IBM's RS/6000. This achievement clearly demonstrates the sustained<br>
ability of DIGITAL and Oracle to provide customers the most scalable<br>
computing solutions for their business-critical applications.<br>
<p>
Following the main tent presentations, customers and partners were<br>
invited to attend a number of hard-hitting, content-rich breakout<br>
sessions delivered by DIGITAL senior VPs about DIGITAL UNIX, Alpha, data<br>
warehousing, enterprise applications, Internet, Oracle solutions and<br>
DIGITAL Services.<br>
<p>
Jesse Lipcon, DIGITAL VP, UNIX and OpenVMS Systems Business Unit,<br>
delivered a masterful presentation on the Future of Alpha.  His remarks<br>
clearly drove home the message: Alpha delivers 50% to 100% higher<br>
performance than Merced at 20% the cost.  "Jesse Lipcon," commented a<br>
customer, "was really phenomenal.  His knowledge and confidence are<br>
captivating and reassuring!"<br>
<p>
Customers who attended the event responded favorably to what they heard.<br>
<p>
"The type of messages I received at this event helped me represent<br>
DIGITAL inside my organization, which at times is no easy task.  The<br>
102K benchmark result with Oracle is an easy message my CEO will<br>
understand... DIGITAL is twice as fast as the competition and costs<br>
less!"<br>
<p>
"I had no idea that DIGITAL was such a major player in data warehousing,<br>
but when I heard and saw the real-world results of Acxiom, it made us<br>
rethink including DIGITAL on our next shortlist."<br>
<p>
Dan Belanger, State Street Corporation account manager, said, "This<br>
event scored a big home run with my customers.  Actually, it was more<br>
like a GRAND SLAM!!  They came to New York with a number of concerns,<br>
they heard everything they needed to hear, and left feeling confident in<br>
their decision to go with DIGITAL!" <br>
<p>
I must say, I was really proud to be part of the team at this event.<br>
The whole experience was exhilarating and gave a well-earned boost to<br>
everyone's spirits - customers, partners and DIGITAL attendees alike.<br>
