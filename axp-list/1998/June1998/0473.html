Hello all!<br>
In case you are not familiar with the internals of the AXPpci33 or kernel<br>
programming you can safely skip this somewhat larger posting...<br>
<p>
OK. To the facts:<br>
I am currently trying to write a device driver for those eight diagnostic<br>
LEDs of the AXPpci33 (aka Noname) board. I think they could be very useful<br>
for displaying all kinds of stuff or even interfacing to other hardware like<br>
LCD display modules and thelike. So I wanted to do it.<br>
Referring to the axppci33_ref_memory.txt file the LEDs are connected in some<br>
strange manner to the memory bus of the CPU and are located at address<br>
0 3880.0000 which is far away from any real physical memory. I also learned<br>
that the lca architecture uses memory organised in four banks; the LEDs are<br>
therefor located in the fourth bank.<br>
<p>
My first guess was to write a driver which just writes to this address<br>
translated using phys_to_virt. But nothing happens! No kernel messages, no<br>
reaction of the LEDs.<br>
<p>
Second thought was that the strange latch circuit which is used to connect<br>
the LEDs might need some rising and falling edges to detect the new data so<br>
I first wrote a 0 then the desired value and a 0 again. Nothing. Vice versa<br>
the same process (value - 0 - value) also nothing.<br>
<p>
Then I tried to read the address range of the flash memory which is in the<br>
same bank in order to find out if I am in the correct address space. And I<br>
really got some data which quite looked like some piece of MILO ;)<br>
<p>
Then I thought the firmware uses the LEDs to display it's status during<br>
power-on. After that the LEDs keep the same pattern throughout any other<br>
operation, i.e. starting MILO and Linux. So I thought that the firmware<br>
might mask this memory area out using the Bank Address Mask Registers, i.e.<br>
BMR3 for the fourth bank at address 1 2000.0038. Since this address is write<br>
only I tried writing 0 to it to enable all adresses (0=evaluate address<br>
1=don't evaluate). After writing 0 to it and writing to the LED's address<br>
caused some kernel messages!<br>
It said that an access to non-exsitent memory 0x38800000 occured which is<br>
the LED address. And strangely I got two messages: One about an illegal read<br>
and second about an illegal write, but I don't read the LED address!<br>
<p>
OK I thought. Maybe the ref-text is false and the register has to be set to<br>
1 in order to enable the decoding so I wrote 0xffffffffffffffffff (the other<br>
bits are supposed to be ignored!). Now the machine froze completely without<br>
any message ;)<br>
<p>
And now here I am and am completely clueless.<br>
Are those damn LEDs controllable after MILO and Linux have booted?<br>
Is the BMR the cause I cannot write there?<br>
Do I need to enable some hidden feature to gain access to the LEDs?<br>
<p>
I already asked Jay Estabrook about that problem and he also had no idea why<br>
this does not work but maybe some other Alpha hacker has.<br>
If yes and even if it is just a "small" idea, please tell me! I soldered<br>
this thing together and want to have it working now ;) And besides this I<br>
think it could really be usable.<br>
<p>
OK. Thank you for your attention!<br>
Hopefully read you soon ;)<br>
