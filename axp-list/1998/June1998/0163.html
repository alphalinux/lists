I have found *any* Motif application unusable over a dialup.  I'm not <br>
exactly sure if this is a deficiency in Motif or Xt...<br>

<p>
A lot of programs probably ought to be rewritten.  That doesn't mean we<br>
necessarily have to overhaul the X protocol.  Keeping backward compatiblity<br>
is necessary to leverage the existing base of X applications and servers...<br>
<p>
Part of my gripe with the X Consortium (and now the TOG) is the pitiful<br>
effort they have made to modernize the "sample" code.  (They call it<br>
"sample" code, but tell me most vendors don't ship a majority of it<br>
unmodified.)  It looks like 1980's stuff nowadays.  And now we have to<br>
*pay* for it...<br>
<p>
Fortunately I don't think backward compatibility would be too much a burden<br>
for a "next-generation" X window system.  Many of the ideas in X11 are sound.<br>
The sample implementation sucks though.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; That is not what I proposed.  I, in general, like X very much.  And I have</i><br>

<i>&gt; (something unix in general does quite frequently anyway), but if it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; going to be done, I think that the immediate future is a better time than</i><br>
<i>&gt; any, and the Windows stranglehold gets only stronger.  My feeling is just</i><br>
<i>&gt; that backwards compatibility with existing X can make the advancement of X</i><br>
<i>&gt; where it is needed most (the UI/Toolkit layer, imho) difficult to</i><br>
<i>&gt; impossible, and almost certainly impossible without horrible hacks.  Then,</i><br>
<i>&gt; while designing this new system, why not take the opportunity to see if</i><br>
<i>&gt; there are other areas in which X can be "cleaned". </i><br>
<p>
You've made some good suggestions.  Higher-level tookits (kinda like Qt) <br>
will go a long way towards making X more usable.<br>
<p>
I would start off by rewriting Xlib.  There's a lot of crap in there now,<br>
and almost all X programs rely too much on it.  The good news is that we<br>
could do a replacement for Xlib and not lose any compatibility as long as<br>
we keep the old Xlib around and don't break any of the existing X protocol.<br>
<p>
I can see the benefits to making the X server more toolkit-aware.  Not that<br>
I would want anything like Motif code in my X server though...  One of my<br>
ideas is to implement common toolkit operations like dialogs with some sort<br>
of platform-neutral bytecode (OK, there's a plug for java I suppose), and<br>
have a server extension so that my application can upload the bytecode to<br>
the server where it can execute more efficiently.  That'll work nicely <br>
over a network connection and without any precustomization of the display <br>
server.  (This should sound real familar to any NS/OS/Rhapsody users <br>
whose DPS servers have done that for years...)<br>
