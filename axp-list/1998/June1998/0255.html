 I had similar symptoms one day.  Their reason was the CPU losing<br>
interrupts.  In fact, the PCI-ISA bridge (if that tells you anything...)<br>
had the PCI to ISA IRQ routing broken.<br>
<p>
 As of modules -- they work flawlessly in 2.1.x without any extra steps.<br>
AFAIK, there is a way to make them work perfectly with 2.0.x, but I never<br>
bothered to find out how.<br>
<p>

<p>
 I guess you are using a 2.0.x and a CONFIG_ALPHA_SRM_SETUP configuration. <br>
The problem is currently fixed in the 2.1.x series.  You may choose one of<br>
the following solutions: <br>
<p>
1. Disable CONFIG_ALPHA_SRM_SETUP.  You won't be able to halt/reboot<br>
cleanly.  It will be OK from Linux's side: you will just have to type<br>
'init' within SRM after halt.  And you will see somewhat annoying<br>
behaviour of reboot.  (Well, I suppose you observe this behaviour anyway,<br>
as there is a small omission present in 2.0.33, which prevents<br>
CONFIG_ALPHA_SRM_SETUP from having a positive impact on Avanti machines.) <br>
;-) <br>
<p>
2. Wait for 2.0.34 be released by Alan.  Hopefully Jay will survive an<br>
extra overload caused by the need of preparing patches for Alpha/2.0.34<br>
and they will finally appear on 'gatekeeper'.<br>
<p>
3. Use the current 2.1.x release -- 2.1.101 works for me but YMMV.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Clearly the address is the problem. Again I wish I knew what RedHat did</i><br>
<i>&gt; to get their kernel to work. I really hate it when they do something and</i><br>
<i>&gt; do not document it or make the source they used available, Isn't this</i><br>
<i>&gt; what the GPL is supposed to prevent? </i><br>
<p>
 Apparently, you did not use the RH's kernel but the one from<br>
'gatekeeper'.  Or did RH apply that patch finally? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm also booting from the SRM console and the SRM PCI support is</i><br>
<i>&gt; labelled as "new". I may try blowing ARC into the flash and booting from</i><br>
<i>&gt; that although I don't see why that should matter since my other PCI</i><br>
<i>&gt; stuff like scsi works fine. </i><br>
<p>
 I wouldn't do that.  ARC is not so nice as SRM and also it prints that<br>
nasty "Copyright Microsoft...".  SCSI works by accident -- the IRQ route<br>
happens to be correct for this slot.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Thanks for the note, I think the 0x10100 address you reported is</i><br>
<i>&gt; significant to me. </i><br>
<p>
 It just hints that SRM PCI configuration is in use -- Linux does not set<br>
up devices in such a way because, the I/O space on Intels is limited to 64<br>
kB.<br>
<p>
 BTW, cc to axp-list as others may be interested, too.<br>
