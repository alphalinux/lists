I have been desparately trying to get Linux to run on my AlphaStation<br>
600 5/333 for an exorbitant amount of time, and I've gotten completely<br>
fed up with it.  So here are my problems, in case any kind soul has<br>
found any solutions.<br>
<p>
1.  Running DEC Unix 4.0A binaries.<br>
It seems that my video card, a TGA ZLXp-E3 is not supported by XFree86.<br>
Well, that's no big deal, seeing as the TGA X Server crashes on my<br>
machine anyway.  The error I get from that is <br>
<p>
X: memory violation at pc=00000000 rp=00000000 (bad address = 00000000)<br>
<p>
Well, whatever.  I thought, I can run the Dec unix X server.  So I read<br>
up on how to run such binaries on linux, and I got all the appropriate<br>
shlibs and /sbin/loader and /etc/svc.conf, etc...  from a handy tape<br>
backup of the previous OS, DEC Unix 4.0A.  Okeedokee, I need a 2.1.x<br>
kernel!  Next problem.<br>
<p>
2. Compiling 2.1.x kernel<br>
I decided, why not get the most recent one.  No deal, I didn't see a TGA<br>
console option in there anywhere (I looked, really!), and the only thing<br>
close was a TGA framebuffer, which didn't work at all.  So I read up and<br>
found that a lot of people got 2.1.108 to work.  Tried that - enabled<br>
TGA Console, disabled framebuffers...  nothing.  This could all possibly<br>
stem from problem 3, which I'll get to soon.  Then I went back REALLY<br>
FAR and saw that people were using 2.1.88 without much hullabullou, so I<br>
thought I'd give that a shot.  Nope, just about as functional as the<br>
2.1.108.  I think I'll segway into problem 3 now, so I can get more into<br>
detail on this.<br>
<p>
3.  Compiling MILO<br>
Well, I'm using the MILO image from the xlt-alcor disk.  Booting from<br>
the ARC console (Because the SRM console refuses to boot linux for me, I<br>
won't even get into that).  The thing works fine, except that between<br>
when the PALcode is loaded, and the kernel takes over, my screen looks<br>
like a giant square stoplight.  Garbled output and such - Nothing<br>
readable, although I'm starting to know what happens based on the<br>
different colors the screen turns.  (Green means the kernel is going,<br>
purple means an error, white means checking hardware stuffs, it's all<br>
very fascinating.)  Anyway, when the kernel boots, everything's fine<br>
again, except that the cursor is about 8 characters wide, instead of 1.<br>
Nothing too annoying.  I thought if I recompiled milo, maybe I could get<br>
it to look nicer.  And maybe the video problems I was having with the<br>
2.1.x kernels (see Problem 2) would go away, since they don't seem to be<br>
able to get the text mode working at all.  Just stays garbled... boots<br>
(or seems to), but then I can't telnet in, so I don't really know what's<br>
going on.   No, I can't connect anything to my serial port - I have<br>
nothing to connect.  So I'm stuck with a garbled-output MILO, a 2.0.34<br>
kernel with an odd cursor, that doesn't load 4.0A binaries, an X server<br>
which crashes and doesn't like my video card anyway, and on top of<br>
that...<br>
<p>
4. Unaligned trap<br>
<p>
I read a bunch of seemingly incorrect stuff on this.  But then again, my<br>
machine seems not to conform to any of Redhat's happy FAQs, so I'm not<br>
surprised.  Umm - it says that when you get these warnings, it means<br>
that the kernel has fixed the problem for you?  Well, I don't call a<br>
segmentation fault a fix.  Man doesn't work, for an example.  Mkswap,<br>
though probably unrelated, doesn't work either... something about not<br>
handling a kernel paging request at virtual address 000000000000428.<br>
That gives me an Oops.  <br>
<p>
<p>
As one last thing, has anyone been able to successfully mount a UFS<br>
cdrom?  If so, how?  I'd like to mount my Digital Unix 3.2C CD, so maybe<br>
I can avoid this whole mess with 2.1.x kernels altogether.<br>
<p>
TIA for any light anyone can shed on my problems... I think I'll go out<br>
to lunch now.<br>
