I've got a list of about 8-10 users who are all experiencing a lot of<br>
problems with memory violation errors.  I've compiled information from<br>
all of them, and am simply lost as to what the cause may be.  Nobody<br>
seems able to help, and we are all about ready to go back to Intel boxes<br>
out of desperation.<br>
<p>
We all get errors of the type:<br>
 ipop3d: memory violation at 155558d7130 rp=15558ca81c (bad<br>
address=15555d834a0)<br>
<p>
This occurs with a variety of programs, but seems particularly prevalent<br>
in mysqld and other daemons with a relatively high load.  Here's the<br>
confusing details:<br>
<p>
1) One of us only has this problem with Mysqld.  I only have this<br>
problem with RPM's that I have compiled in house from SRPM's.  Another<br>
of us has these problems with an out-of-the-box installation.<br>
<p>
2) We are all using RH 5.0<br>
<p>
3) Most of us have PC 164LX, 533Mhz motherboards, but one of us has a<br>
UDB 166.  Most of us have tried two motherboards and two sets of RAM.<br>
<p>
4) Glibc seems to be the location pointed to by ldd output most of the<br>
time, but others have found the location to be in other libraries.<br>
<p>
5) I have tried using both a base install, and a fully updated setup<br>
(all of RH's errata RPMS).  Same results both ways.<br>
<p>
6) We have tried kernels ranging from 2.0.30 to 2.0.33 with a variety of<br>
options.<br>
<p>
7) I did not notice this problem on my first install of the OS.  Later,<br>
I needed to re-partition my drives, and that's when the problem<br>
appeared.  I have since re-installed three times with no luck getting<br>
the problem to go away.<br>
<p>
Does anyone have any suggestions for us?  These errors eventually kill<br>
most of our daemons, so the Alpha boxes are essentially useless to us.<br>
Surely, there must be something we are all doing wrong since the<br>
majority of the list seems to have no idea what we are talking about.<br>
Any suggestions as to where we should start looking?<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
Dana<br>
