Your problem sounds very familiar to me..  I've seen my clock running<br>
around twice as ast as it should. <br>
<p>
I've got three Machines, all identical SX164 boards running at 533MHz. <br>
Sometimes the cmos clock runs up to dates well past 2000.  Sometimes the<br>
software clock STOPS running. <br>
<p>
Unfortunately these machines are running at a remote location, and so my<br>
actually monitoring them is over the network, and I'm very hesitant to<br>
make major changes to the system since getting to the machines is a<br>
pain.<br>
<p>
I do know that while I was walking a tech through the boot process one<br>
day the MILO countdown was running at nearly double speed. Because of<br>
that I'm thinking that I need to try a newer version of MILO.  I'm<br>
preparing to attempt this, and really hope that nothing goes wrong, as I<br>
don't want to attempt to get the machine back up w/o being there if I<br>
fail.<br>
<p>
Just thought that I'd add in my symptoms and see if they sound familiar.<br>
<p>
