Well, Ken Hansen took an approach that I didn't even get to in my<br>
thought process, I didn't get past the basic logistics of the matter to<br>
cover the things he did.  I think I have a rather unique perspective on the<br>
matter given my history of working at Red  Hat in the early days.  <br>
My comments are below (in a much-edited copy of the original)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Below is a conversation that I am involved in with RedHat regarding</i><br>
<i>&gt; their supporting those of us that purchase supported "boxed-sets" for</i><br>
[...]<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 	Eagles may soar, but weasels don't get sucked into jet engines.</i><br>
<p>
	One of my all-time favorite .sig lines...  :-)<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The first reply from RedHat to my request "below"</i><br>
[...]<br>
<i>&gt; Best Regards</i><br>
<i>&gt; Alice</i><br>
<p>
	Alice is a wonderful lady, one of the gems at Red Hat, has been there<br>
for about two years now.  In my  experiences with her (as co-worker and <br>
customer)<br>
"service" is not a foreign concept to her.<br>
<p>
<p>
[...]<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; either Intel, Alpha, or PPC code. I understand that in the case of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Linux, the size of the distribution makes that impractical, couldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you, upon verification of a home Multi-Platform installation, include</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the CD for the second Platform? I would think that would be a minor</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; thing. The installation manuals, and the SRPM disks should be the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; same, so it would only require 1 extra CD. You could make it an option</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; when placing the order, maybe an additional charge of $3 to 5 for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; extra disk would be well received, and help to defray your costs, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; our expenses when upgrading.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<p>
	Herein lies the problem from a logistics standpoint.<br>
<p>
	First, the manual.  Now that *real* tech-writers have control of it<br>
(as has been the case since right after my name quit appearing in the credits)<br>
the growing size has resulted in the segregation of an Alpha addendum.  <br>
Fortunately<br>
the quality of the manual has increased at a pace greater than or equal to the <br>
increase<br>
in size.  So, if you have Alpha and Intel there's not just a CD, there's an <br>
additional<br>
book(let) as well.  Not that it matters a whit, adding two parts isn't much <br>
worse than<br>
adding one. <br>
<p>
*BUT* adding that one part is nearly impossible given the logistics of the <br>
packaging<br>
and shipping methodology involved.  Nowadays a fulfillment house handles all <br>
the<br>
busy work for Red Hat.  It's simply more efficient.  Fulfillment houses <br>
by-and-large<br>
do an excellent job when you give them a recipe for a product and the <br>
ingredients and<br>
let them at it.  When you start offering it on a "Have it your way" basis <br>
you're asking<br>
for trouble.  A couple of years ago when things were packed by hand, in-house, <br>
this<br>
would have worked nicely.  But now, knowing what I know, I just don't see a <br>
way for<br>
it to happen.  <br>
<p>
The Power Tools is your best bet.<br>
