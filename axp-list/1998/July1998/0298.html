Greetings,<br>
<p>
I run a Digital "Multia" UDB as a low-end web server. I've run into a<br>
problem, though - on boot the machine hangs/stalls during the network init<br>
process. Oddly enough, this never happened when I was running the stock<br>
2.0.30 kernel... the machine was a very reliable web server... but since<br>
upgrading to 2.0.33 the network init completely fails. <br>
<p>
I've spent a great deal of time going through the axp-list archives for<br>
clues on how to solve this problem. As it happens, I thought I'd found the<br>
solution when I came across an old post regarding this matter which<br>
suggested terminating the BNC ethernet port. This trick, to my surprise,<br>
actually worked for a time... there would only be a short pause during<br>
network init, and then the machine was up and running fine. However, this<br>
fix wasn't the solution to the problem. Yesterday evening I added 3 new IP<br>
routes, (which I properly did via the appropriate eth0:0, eth0:1, and<br>
eth0:2 config files in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts), and proceeded to<br>
reboot the machine to ensure that these new routes were activated at boot.<br>
As you can probably guess, it stalled during the network init.<br>
<p>
Last night I came across some other vague references to this problem in<br>
the axp-list archives... a couple of suggestions revolved around the the<br>
order in which interfaces are initialized... which is apparently<br>
alphabetically? A couple of people suggested renaming the loopback config<br>
file in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts so that it would be read and<br>
initialized before the ethernet interfaces. <br>
<p>
Does anyone know if the above solution works? I would test this myself,<br>
but unfortunately the machine was recently shipped to a remote network,<br>
and I've been running it from afar. The folks at the ISP where it's<br>
located have no experience with this problem either, so I'm hoping someone<br>
on this list has a solution.<br>
<p>
Thank you in advance,<br>
Jason Kelly<br>
