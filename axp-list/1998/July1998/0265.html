OK; the reason I said 1978  was to my knowledge that was the time<br>
that Unix first made it into the outside world (although since<br>
I was 6 at the time I don't have much recollection of it).<br>
I think thjat was version 7; perhaps version 6 got out before that?<br>
<p>
1969 was the start of development of Unix; and I think it was the<br>
summer of 1974 in which they ported it, in C, to an Interdata<br>
machine (As I recall from the Bell Systems Tech journal that I read,<br>
the machines were on different floors, they didn't have remote<br>
reboot and the machines took different tape formats which they<br>
had to convert on a different floor....)<br>
