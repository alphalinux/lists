<p>
We do not stop anyone from using KDE!  I don't understand this assault <br>
we have been receiving.  We don't ship a lot of things for one reason <br>
or another.  We try very hard to make it so we are not impeding the <br>
ability of people to exercise their own choice.<br>
<p>
As far as the patches to the kernel, most of them make it into the next <br>
release of a kernel.  They are just patches that provide a greater <br>
level of stability or functionality to the Red Hat user.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Let's not bring the *.advocacy flamewar to this list, please...</i><br>
<p>
Exactly, which is how I started this whole thread.  Let me repeat, <br>
please don't start a thread about Red Hat do this or don't do this <br>
because XYZ does it.  We have chosen a path which we feel is the right <br>
way to go.  We try very hard to not impede anyone along the way, but we <br>
have made our choices.  If you have specific issues with the quality of <br>
our release, then I'd love to hear those reports.<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
