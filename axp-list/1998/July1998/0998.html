you should be able to type<br>
<p>
 set os_type=NY &lt;enter&gt;<br>
<p>
when you re-boot should be in arc with a more intuitive menu selection.   <br>
 i had lots of trouble trying to install from srm and never quite   <br>
succeeded, but arc was pretty easy; follow the manual.  somehwere in the   <br>
arc menus you can set it back to srm/vms.  i can also set mine (as400   <br>
 -4/233) to a dec unix.<br>
<p>
before you exit srrm, type<br>
<p>
 show config&lt;enter&gt;<br>
<p>
here you'll see lots of nifty info on srm settings.  a little extra   <br>
knowledge can't hurt.<br>

Subject: New AXP owner, with much confusion.<br>
<p>
<p>
I recently purchased a used barebones alpha from onsale (I'm sure alot of<br>
others have too, so I must not be the only one on this list).. An Alpha<br>
200 4/233.<br>
I want to set this up for both NT and Linux dual boot, but I've been lost<br>
from the very moment of turning the machine on with the BIOS that's in<br>
there..<br>
Mine is set to start with SRM now, but I think I want to use ARC instead.<br>
How do I go about trying to get it? I've read in the manual for my   <br>
machine<br>
that I need to use a CD to install this, but from the Digital site, that<br>
its already in my machine and I need to set a jumper for it. Which is<br>
correct? And, if its CD only, where do I go about either getting these<br>
files so I can write them to a disk myself or purchasing the disk from<br>
DEC?<br>
What else is required? Can someone give me a good URL?<br>
