Seems to me the real answer for the ever-popular Netscape issue<br>
would be to include a static-linked executable, not the best<br>
solution, but it "should" work, right?<br>
<p>
I would find it hard to believe that Compaq will license a few<br>
libraries/etc. to allow a non-DU licensed box to run DU executables!<br>
What is the incentive to buy DU, if you are only going to run<br>
someone elses code?<br>
<p>
I suspect that Compaq/Digital would view the use of DU libraries<br>
as having a negative impact on their sales of Digital Unix OS. Of<br>
course, one could argue that many of the people that would take<br>
advantage of this license would never have bought DU in the first<br>
place, so thye are not, in fact, losing that many sales.<br>
<p>
	That sounds like a good argument, but let's think it<br>
through - Compaq/Digital decides that they want to offer Red Hat<br>
the right to distribute their DU run-time libraries, and for this<br>
use, Compaq/Digital wants $50,000 (just to pull a number out of<br>
the air) for this - fine, Red Hat then pays this money on the<br>
expectation that this will drive sales of Red Hat for Alpha <br>
through the roof, but they will have to raise the price a bit to<br>
cover the expense, say $10. That means that Red Hat is out money<br>
UNTIL they sell the 5,001 copy of Red Hat for Alpha.<br>
<p>
	Now, let's make this number real - Compaq/Digital wants a<br>
few thousand dollars for the real, full Digital Unix, so let's say<br>
a copy of DU costs $2,500.  Now Compaq/Digital figures they will<br>
lose out on a total of 100 licenses of DU as people buy boxes to<br>
run Red Hat w/DU Libs. (any additional hardware sales for this<br>
platform they would not have had before will be counted as "profit"<br>
- the reason they are in business. Now, that means that Compaq/Digital<br>
will expect to generate $250,000 from it's license activites, and<br>
let's just say that BOTH Red Hat and Debian decide to license these<br>
libraries, and let's further say that a third, as yet unnamed group<br>
puts together an Alpha/Linux port and they too want to use the new<br>
DU libraries - that means that Red Hat will have to pay 1/3 of the<br>
$250,000, or $83,000 +/-. Now, how will Red Hat cover their expenses<br>
for this expensive license, raise prices. How many copies of Red<br>
Hat linux do you think are sold for the Alpha platform? Well, all I<br>
can do is guess, but I think it would be EXTREMELY OPTOMISTIC that<br>
Red Hat sells 83,000 copies of Alpha Linux. I also don't think they<br>
sell 41,500 copies, nor do I suspect they sell 20,750 copies BUT,<br>
let's be optomistic and say they sell 10,375 copies, that means they<br>
would have to raise the price by about $8 a copy, just to cover this<br>
feature, no profit to Red Hat until they sell their 10,376th copy!<br>
<p>
NOTE - 	All following numbers are contrived for the sake of this<br>
	example!<br>
<p>
	But, guess what, Red Hat doesn't sell 10,376 copies of Linux<br>
for Alpha - as best as I can figure, they sell:<br>
<p>
	Projected Revenues for 1998			$15,000,000<br>
<p>
	Less commercial Support Contracts		$ 1,500,000<br>
<p>
	Less license fees from Caldera			$ 1,000,000<br>
<p>
	Less license/development fees from Corel	$   500,000<br>
 <br>
	Less fees to include CDs in books		$ 1,000,000<br>
<p>
	Less merchandising (hats/tee shirts/books)	$   250,000<br>
							-----------<br>
	Total revenue from software sales		$10,750,000<br>
<p>
	Divided by cost of each unit sold		Div by   25<br>
	(est. to be one-half retail price)		-----------<br>
<p>
	Units sold (all platforms)			    430,000<br>
<p>
	Now what is the breakdown per platform?<br>
<p>
		Intel/386		95%		408,500 units<br>
<p>
		Compaq/Digital Alpha	 2.5%		 10,750 units<br>
<p>
		Sun SPARC		 2.5%		 10,750 units<br>
<p>
Now, based on my completely made-up numbers, Red Hat would have to<br>
increase the price of Red Hat Linux for Alpha by $23.25 - let's call<br>
it $25 (include a bit of profit for Red Hat).<br>
<p>
Would you pay $75 for a copy of Red Hat for Alpha, and do you have <br>
almost 11,000 friends that will do likewise? Every year?<br>
<p>
I suspect Red Hat will not spend too much time on this "idea."<br>
<p>
BTW, I don't think a company like Compaq/Digital can do anything out<br>
of the ordinary if it involves less than $250,000 in revenue - Think<br>
of the lawyers time to craft the Right-To-Use license, the developers<br>
time to isolate and verify the code they are suppling will work as<br>
intendes, and the contingency support if these packaged libraries<br>
fail and need to be corrected. No, I think Compaq/Digital would<br>
probably need to see something closer to $1,000,000/year to set up<br>
such an arrangement.<br>
<p>
Food for thought,<br>
<p>

NOTE: All numbers above are made-up, and are for example only - the<br>
only number I have any real sense of is the $15 million in projected<br>
revenue for Red Hat and the retail cost of Red Hat Linux at $50.<br>
