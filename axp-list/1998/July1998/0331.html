<p>
Yes.  It clearly says it can't be done (although that's MS's answer, not<br>
mine :).  I just used a 4MB #9 GXE64pro card, who's drivers are much<br>
better to say the least.  I ran 1600x1200x65k with no visible performance<br>
degration with the #9 -- on the ZLXp-E2, any res above 640x480xtrue was<br>
dreadful.  (For the #9, this is a performance gain above the UDB -- I<br>
don't know why, but the AS200 is faster with that card.)<br>
<p>
I don't suppose anyone has started hacking on the XF86_TGA X server to get<br>
it to work with the 24-bit -E2 and -E3 cards yet?  :)<br>

<p>
I definitly like it in all ways better than the UDB I had (166mhz, 256k).<br>
Personal opinion is that for some reason, it likes NT better (I had to<br>
install NT to impress my friends with something they could relate<br>
to...) I haven't noticed any major differences in Linux (but that's only a<br>
interactive response benchmark!)  I still don't have any X going.  <br>
 <br>

<i>&gt; brain-damaged like the UDBs?</i><br>
<p>
Ooo...no, at least not in mine.  AFAIK, the UDB I had used a 21066 --<br>
that's a 21064a with on-chip support sets (PCI, etc) and with one of the<br>
busses halved down to 64-bit (I don't remember which bus it was though).<br>
The AS200 I've got seems to have a full-blown 21064a.  (i really like the<br>
vaxish 'sho dev' and 'sho conf')  There's a desc of all those chips<br>
around somewhere (probably at www.azstarnet.com/~axplinux).<br>
<p>
The AS200 4/166's are definitly not in any way brain-damaged.<br>

<p>
$390???   I originally was going to wait until the "first month inflation"<br>
on OnSale went away...but it doesn't appear to be happening! (Glad I<br>
didn't wait.)<br>
<p>
I'd suggest the latter... OnSale is a notoriously bad place to buy<br>
computers of any sort.  I'd suggest EBay for all the serious<br>
buyers/sellers out there -- AZDigital does put one of these systems up on<br>
EBay every once and a while, so look for them if you want one and object<br>
to OnSale.  <br>
<p>
I'm doubting these machines are actually worth $400...<br>
