Just wanted to warn people that there seems to be some kind of problem<br>
with the ncr scsi driver in kernel 2.1.108.  I was in the process of<br>
trying to do a backup, and the harddrive quit spinning with a clunk,<br>
and my screen started filling up with scsi error messages.<br>
<p>
I thought it was my harddrive, which would have really upset me, since I<br>
was in the middle of doing a backup.  But after restarting everything<br>
seemed to be fine.  But it kept happening during heavy disk usage, and<br>
restarting seemed to set everything back to normal.  I'm back to<br>
2.1.107, where I haven't seen the problems - yet. 8-)<br>
<p>
My machine is an XL300 with the standard ncr scsi controller.<br>
<p>
While I'm on the subject, what tape backups have people used<br>
successfully?  I'd like to go as inexpensive as possible (which<br>
probably rules out scsi).  I've read that possibly the Travan 5GB<br>
parallel might work, but what are people using?  I'd prefer not to go<br>
internal, either (hm, does the XL300 even have IDE...?).<br>
<p>
Oh, one other thing.  The backup I was doing was onto a jaz, which I<br>
was formatting in dos format so I could read it from a non-linux<br>
machine.  I'm using mkdosfs which I got from the redhat contrib<br>
directory, but it doesn't create fs's that linux recognizes.  Anyone<br>
know what's wrong or where I could get a working version?<br>
<p>
thanks,<br>
-Wes.<br>
