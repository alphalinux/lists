Jay Estabrook, of Digital/Compaq, wrote the 980606 MILO, and the link from<br>
my page links to one of the digital.com ftp sites.<br>
<p>
As for this MILO, I'm surprised to hear of the problems, since I know of<br>
MANY people that have used it and it worked fine.  As an alternate, you<br>
could follow the instructions on my website to go through the serial<br>
console, which I did before this MILO was out, and it worked fine.  Once you<br>
get the machine installed, and MILO on a boot partition, you shouldn't need<br>
to be able to read the screen as MILO does its stuff anyway, if you are<br>
having problems.<br>

&gt;&gt; i have a similar problem.  i have a digital alpha station 400 4/233.  i
&gt;&gt; also have srm and no arc.  i tried installing 5.0 a while ago only to
&gt;&gt; find out that milo was not well supported for this model.  is 5.1 any
&gt;&gt; better?  and is it possible to get arc on here?
&gt;
&gt;The state of MILO as I know it:
&gt;Most available MILOs for the avanti: when run, you get a green screen
&gt;  where you can see nothing
&gt;A slightly patched MILO a friend did: when run, it *almost* works, but the
&gt;  cursor is 8 characters wide.
&gt;milo-avanti-980606: cursor is correct, but when attempting to boot a
&gt;  kernel we get ...Fatal error: not enough memory on at least two machines
&gt;  we tried
&gt;The milo available from the debian-alpha milo developer whose name escapes
&gt;  me: readable screen, cursor has same (8 chars wide) problem, when scroll
&gt;  becomes necessary things get goofy.
&gt;
&gt;Interestingly SRM does something with the cursor that ARC does not, so if
&gt;you can boot milo from SRM, the MILo my friend did works correctly, but I
&gt;want to use ARC, so either:
&gt;a) maybe the patches which make the cursor work correctly in
&gt;milo-avanti-980606 could be made available? I'd ask the person who did
&gt;them, but I can't find any announcement of where this milo came from, only
&gt;after-the-fact statements.
&gt;b) otherwise, when I get time I'm going to have to do a lot of work to
&gt;MILO to make it dump registers, and try it under both ARC and SRM.
&gt;
&gt;I like a, I suspect b.
&gt;
&gt;I've heard reports from others that milo-avanti-980606 worked for them.
&gt;I'm curious what's different about our hardware, but since I have
&gt;something that almost works, I haven't pursued it.
