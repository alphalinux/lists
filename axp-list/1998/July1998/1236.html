Well, that doesn't really have anything to do with the current problem. <br>
Unless you're saying that 256MB segments are the drawback.  If you're<br>
talking about the 16 slots, then making the segment size too small would<br>
use more slots than needed.  If it's just a matter of divvying up 4GB of<br>
address space, I'm sure there has to be a better medium than 16 slots of<br>
256MB or 1024 slots of just under 4 MB. <br>

<p>
How often is shared memory really needed?  This strikes me as being<br>
something needed primarily for pre-threaded apps.  I'm not saying it's<br>
useless, but I think that there is little demand for it in general and<br>
that demand is not increasing.  I think it's a relatively low-demand type<br>
of thing.  UNIXen are primarily dealing with pipes, not shm...<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; a warning and proceed with the less optimal amount. </i><br>

Well, it'll all be handled over the web so the actual parameters are going<br>
to be hard coded anyway.  It's no biggie, but I would think that it would<br>
be a bigger general problem.  X uses shared memory, as does the GIMP<br>
(though I don't know how the two use it in concert if at all).  What this<br>
is used for I don't know, but I would gladly give up 512 or 768 shared<br>
memory segments in leiu of a larger maximum shared memory pool.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; At $.99 a blank CD now, it's not too painful to screw</i><br>
<i>&gt; up but I've never had a buffer underrun with cdrecord.</i><br>
<p>
It's not so easy to happen unintentionally often.  I was writing at 4x<br>
while flipping back and forth in windowmaker and loading the GIMP trying<br>
to make it swap as much as possible without renice'ing the cdrecord<br>
processes.  There were 29 underruns in total out of 22,000+ sectors<br>
(336,000+ blocks).  Under normal load this should be rare.  This was also<br>
a 2MB buffer, not the 3MB I've set it at now.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; From what I remember, the default Solaris 2.5 SHM max</i><br>
<i>&gt; is only 1MB so 4MB isn't that bad.</i><br>
<p>
I find that difficult to believe.  It's probably 4MB.  =)<br>
