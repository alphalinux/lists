<i>&gt; Gee... thanks for your help Chris?!?</i><br>
<p>
Hmm.. Maybe we aren't used to unix beginners on this list (and a mailing<br>
list might not be the best way to learn either).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; --------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt; I have several Unix books and verified that I'm using the gunzip command</i><br>
<i>&gt; correctly.</i><br>
<p>
Well, if you really read the manual, you should know that only one file<br>
can be extracted from a .gz archive. gzip is only a compressor, to store<br>
several files, tar is often used in the unix world.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The only documentation I've found on the web for the Quake/Alpha/Linux</i><br>
<i>&gt; version states that all I need to do</i><br>
<i>&gt; is unpack this .gz file into my /quake directory and bring over the .pak</i><br>
<i>&gt; files (from the DOS version of the game) into</i><br>
<i>&gt; my /quake/id1 folder.</i><br>
<p>
Yep, this is correct as to needed files.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I did that, but I still have to ask,</i><br>
<i>&gt; what am I doing wrong because I am obviously missing some files which I</i><br>
<i>&gt; suspect</i><br>
<i>&gt; are inside the .gz file but aren't being unpacked/extracted correctly??</i><br>
<p>
Nope, only one file, the binary, is in the .gz file. gunzip by default<br>
sets the unpacked name to the same as the archive minus the '.gz'<br>
extention, but you may call it what you wish.<br>
<p>
There are four possible problems I can see here.<br>
1. The binary is not executable. Make it so using:<br>
	chmod 755 xquake-whatever-its-name-is<br>
<p>
2. You don't have current dir or the quake dir in your path and try to<br>
   execute it just like<br>
	xquake-whatever-its-name-is<br>
   To execute a binary in the current directory but not in the path:<br>
	./xquake-whatever-its-name-is<br>
<p>
3. Your current dir is not set to your quake directory. I think the 'id1'<br>
   directory must be in your current dir, not necessary in the quake dir.<br>
   If this is the problem, just cd to your quake directory.<br>
<p>
4. Your binary is of the binary format a.out (as opposed to ELF which is<br>
   the usual binary format in linux nowadays). Many of the xquake binaries<br>
   out there are so old that they were made when another binary format was<br>
   ruling.<br>
   If this is the case you need support for these a.out binaries in the<br>
   kernel, but I think this comes by default with Red Hat kernels.<br>
   If you miss it, you may need to recompile the kernel or make a module<br>
   for a.out support. You can check the file format of the binary using:<br>
	file xquake-whatever-its-name-is<br>
   If this is your problem, it may be easier to find an ELF binary, there<br>
   are a bunch out there.<br>
<p>
It's a little difficult do guess what the problem is when you don't say<br>
what's happening when you're trying, except that is doesn't work.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Hopefully, someone that's done this and got it working can shed some light</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the situation.</i><br>
<p>
I have tried quake and it works. There are no more files in the .gz<br>
archive.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Thanks in advance for any help,</i><br>
<i>&gt; -km</i><br>
<p>
I hope you can find some help in this message, I'm not really sure how<br>
much you know, so I send it with the risk of being too instructive..<br>
<p>
Good luck!<br>
<p>
