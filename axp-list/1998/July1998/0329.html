<p>
Well, users who might get confused shouldn't use -v -- or Fortran,<br>
gcc, or UNIX, etc. for that matter.  :)<br>
<p>
But, if you have some recommendations, or, ideally, patches to offer<br>
to reduce this problem -- which, BTW, I don't recall seeing anybody<br>
else run into -- submit them to the appropriate address, by all<br>
means!  I'm all for making products less confusing.  Note that these<br>
patches/recommendations could target the docs, not necessarily<br>
the ways the products work.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm only looking at symptoms. I make no claims that what</i><br>
<i>&gt;I see and what is happening are necessarily related.</i><br>
<p>
All I can say is that your original email seemed to say exactly<br>
that.  Chalk it up to a misunderstanding, I guess.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Perhaps you should submit a bug report?  Both g77 and gcc come</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; with extensive documentation, including on how and where to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; file bug reports.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I look at bug reports as a last option. With source, available,</i><br>
<i>&gt;that would be where I look first.</i><br>
<p>
Hmm, though you should be aware that, in effect, you submitted<br>
a bug report to a list that contains a small subset of the people<br>
who *normally* would see a properly submitted bug report, and<br>
thus excluded from your audience quite a number of people<br>
(especially if it was egcs-related) who might have been able<br>
to offer some real help that much quicker.<br>
<p>
At least, it looked to *me* like you were trying to submit a<br>
bug report saying `-p' was incorrectly passed to f771 instead<br>
of `-pg'.  If anyone else disagrees, I hope they'll speak up;<br>
I could certainly use a lesson in how to avoid responding to<br>
bug reports that aren't, so I can spend more time getting<br>
productive work done.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The link shows gcrt1.o at the front and C profiles OK so</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think things are basically working. Question is what</i><br>
<i>&gt;is missing for FORTRAN. I'll do some more looking.</i><br>
<i>&gt;No obvious differences now. The xxx.o has _mcount in it,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and the link uses the correct gcrt1.o file. Maybe it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;a library issue?</i><br>
<p>
Maybe the egcs fix to profiling for the Alpha that you learned<br>
about after writing the above will address your problems, but<br>
I still would hazard a guess that something might be specially<br>
needed to make profiling work for Fortran, since you saw it work<br>
well (enough, anyway) for C code but not at all for Fortran code.<br>
<p>
It's a coincidence, though; I just got another profiling-related<br>
question from a completely different source regarding a special<br>
variant of g77 (for Solaris SPARC, not Alpha).  Guess I might<br>
have to learn about profiling Fortran code after all.  :)<br>
