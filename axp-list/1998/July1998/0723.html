Richard,<br>
	See below please... I have a few thought on this topic, and I<br>
wnated to share them...<br>

<i>&gt; read through the thread, and lend a voice to this. What I am asking for</i><br>
<i>&gt; from RedHat is the option to get multi-platform support with our boxed</i><br>
<i>&gt; sets, rather than requiring that we purchase full separate boxed sets</i><br>
<i>&gt; for each of our platforms</i><br>
<p>
Richard, I take it you mean that I, as a person who has Intel, SPARC &amp;<br>
AXP macines at home running linux should be able to buy 1 package that<br>
contains the distribution media for all three platforms AND installation<br>
support for each of those platforms (as currently the retail boxed sets<br>
do) for a price less than $165 (3x$55)?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; (ahem.. even NT includes multi-platform</i><br>
<i>&gt; versions on their distribution).</i><br>
<p>
Do you think that since Microsoft included multiple platforms on one CD,<br>
you<br>
are entitled to support for installation on up to three differnt boxes,<br>
one of each platform? AFAIK, MS doesn't even want to support/hand hold<br>
WinNT<br>
installations, that is available seperately...<br>
<p>
WHen you buy WinNT you get one license,and you can install that one<br>
licensed<br>
copy of WinNT on any ONE of the included platforms, installation on<br>
multiple<br>
machines is expressly prohibited...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         If we can get more voices involved, maybe we can get some</i><br>
<i>&gt; support on this issue.</i><br>
<p>
Everyone, face North Carolina and shout "We Want More For Less!"<br>

<i>&gt; The first reply from RedHat to my request "below"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; MR. Tibbets,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Are you aware that there is a Power Tools product that comes with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; software</i><br>
<i>&gt; for Intel, Alpha and Sparc.  The only difference in these versions and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the</i><br>
<i>&gt; boxed set is it does not include the commercial software like, BRU &amp;Real</i><br>
<i>&gt; Audio.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Power Tools only sells for $29.95, so this product may be the</i><br>
<i>&gt; solution to</i><br>
<i>&gt; your problem.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Best Regards</i><br>
<i>&gt; Alice</i><br>
<p>
Alice is right, this is what I do - I but the unsupported set that<br>
includes<br>
all platforms, and then I go and buy an Install Guide if it looks better<br>
than<br>
the previous one...<br>
<p>
Luckilly, I have never really needed support from Red Hat for an<br>
installation,<br>
any help I've needed I picked up on the maillist...<br>
<p>
If you want real support, to help you with post-installation issues,<br>
that<br>
is available from Red Hat for a fee.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Subject:      Redhat 5.1 on Multi-Platforms</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Dear staff at RedHat;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;       I have been a purchasing customer since I started using RedHat</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Linux about a year and half ago. I have also lead many new customers</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; your way. I think you have an outstanding product, and I do my best to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; support you as best I can (even recommending (successfully) that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; RedHat be purchased at work (Boeing) on some of the PC's (mine</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; included)).</i><br>
<p>
I'm sure Red Hat appreciates that, and I also would venture to say that<br>
many on this list have done the same...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;       I do however have a simple complaint that I hope you take to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; heart.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;       While at work, boeing will purchase whatever is necessary for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the work machines. That is not a problem.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;       However, at home, I have a problem. I am now "Multi-Platformed"</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; at home, using a DEC Alpha (with RedHat) as my firewall machine, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Intel boxes for my working desktops.</i><br>
<p>
Sounds good so far...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; this has placed a huge strain on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; me if I want registered - supported - current versions on both of my</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; platforms, as it now requires that I purchase 2 sets, 1 for the Alpha,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and 1 for the Intel. so your "free" OS now costs me nearly $110 to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; upgrade.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think Red Hat ever refered to their PRODUCT as FREE, they make a<br>
version (a very USEFUL version I might add) available for free, but it<br>
is not a FREE PRODUCT.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;       While I do not begrudge you your upgrade costs for the CD's, It</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is a bit of a burden when running Multi-Platform.  I recently ordered</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (and have received) 5.1 for my Alpha.</i><br>
<p>
Again, Red Hat thanks you...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I just can't justify buying it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "again" for the Intel.</i><br>
<p>
You are not buying it AGAIN, you are buying a differnt software product<br>
that is EXTREMELY similar to one you already bought, but the two are<br>
not interchangeable (go ahead, try running i386 RPMs on an Alpha - we<br>
all proved with R5.0 that that would not work!)<br>
<p>
If you can't justify it, then don't buy it. If you wnat the latest<br>
version and don't need the commercial software packages included, get<br>
the Power Tools package. If you can't justify that, FTP everything.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Is there not something you can do to help out</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; us home users with more than one platform to support?</i><br>
<p>
Like putting all the platforms in one box?<br>
<p>
I suspect that anyone that has anything other than an Intel box at home<br>
either is a sophisticated computer user (or is well ontheir way there)<br>
OR was totally misled by a "good price" at Onsale.com! The former don't<br>
need support from Red Hat, the latter need LOTS of help.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;       While I hate to draw the comparison: Even Microsoft puts</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; multiple versions of NT on the distribution disk, so it will load</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; either Intel, Alpha, or PPC code.</i><br>
<p>
BUT NOT ALL. Well, you can, but you are viloating the license agreement<br>
you HAD to scroll through to install WinNT.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I understand that in the case of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Linux, the size of the distribution makes that impractical, couldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you, upon verification of a home Multi-Platform installation,</i><br>
<p>
Which would be what, Erik or Donnie drives out to your house and sees<br>
that you have more machines than friends? (Sorry, couldn't help myself)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; include</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the CD for the second Platform? </i><br>
<p>
What about those of us with all three?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I would think that would be a minor</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; thing. The installation manuals, and the SRPM disks should be the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; same, so it would only require 1 extra CD.</i><br>
<p>
Or more...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; You could make it an option</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; when placing the order, maybe an additional charge of $3 to 5 for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; extra disk would be well received, and help to defray your costs, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; our expenses when upgrading.</i><br>
<p>
Our expenses = their revenue, their loss = our savings.<br>
<p>
What percentage of Red Hat sales are conducted one-on-one to enable such<br>
a dialog? I suspect that most sales are through third-party vendors and<br>
book tie-in deals, not people calling North Carolina and asking for a<br>
copy of Linux with Extra Alpha and SPARC code on the side!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;       Please give this some consideration. I'd like to purchase an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; upgrade, and be able to upgrade my whole site, not just selected</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; platforms.</i><br>
<p>
Again, Power Tools...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;       Thank you very much for any time, or consideration you may give</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; this issue.</i><br>
<p>
Well, I spent a good amount of time considering your proposal, and you<br>
are welcome.<br>
<p>
