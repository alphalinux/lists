Hello all,<br>
<p>
A bunch of people from around the Net just solved Certicom's ECC2K-95<br>
problem using 200 Alphas.  There are some details of the calculation<br>
in the submission sent to Certicom, appended below.<br>
<p>
We won a prize of $5000 and split it up as $500 each for the matching<br>
distinguished points that gave the solution and $4000 for the Free<br>
Software Foundation.<br>
<p>
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everybody who joined in.<br>
<p>
Bye,<br>
  Rob.<br>

Almost all of the work was done on 200 Alpha's ranging from desktop<br>
workstations to big parallel servers.  60.1% was done with Linux,<br>
36.1% with Digital Unix, 3.4% with OpenVMS and 0.2% with NetBSD.<br>
The remaining 0.2% was on 32-bit machines running Linux, Risc OS,<br>
Windows NT and OS/2.<br>
<p>
Mike Warren made the biggest contribution using the Avalon network of<br>
seventy 533 MHz Alpha Linux workstations at Los Alamos.  The next biggest<br>
teams were Digital, INRIA, Vienna University of Technology, British<br>
Telecom Labs, the University of Klagenfurt, Victoria University of<br>
Wellington, Center for Water Research and "csmith".<br>
<p>
<p>
The method we used was a birthday paradox algorithm iterating from<br>
many random starting points with a pseudo-random iteration and<br>
reporting those points with a distinguishing characteristic back to<br>
base until a matching pair was found, as for the previous Elliptic<br>
Curve Discrete Logarithm records set by Alpha enthusiasts, British<br>
Telecom Labs and others who worked with us.<br>
<p>
A total of roughly 21600 billion iterations were performed, of which<br>
20202935925971 led to the 74268 distinguished points that were<br>
reported back to base.  The fastest systems were 600 MHz Alpha's doing<br>
up to 177 K iterations per second.  A distinguished point matching a<br>
previously discovered one was found at 4:31 this morning, allowing us to<br>
compute the final answer.  The matching points were found by Mike<br>
Warren with Avalon and by myself with an Alphastation 500/500 at INRIA.<br>
<p>
<p>
Since an ECC2K-95 iteration took about 2.5 times as long as an ECCp-97<br>
iteration, this problem was easier by a factor of 3.7.  A priori, the<br>
two problems appear to be of similar difficulty and since ECCp-97 was<br>
solved with a low number of iterations due to good luck, one might have<br>
expected this one to be the most difficult yet.<br>
<p>
However we used some extra structure by gathering the points into<br>
clusters of 194 points (technically, orbits under the involution [-1]<br>
and the Frobenius endomorphism [(-1+sqrt(-7))/2]).<br>
<p>
We chose a pseudo-random iteration that respected this structure: it<br>
was multiplicative, multiplying each point by 2, 6, 88, 90 or 92<br>
according to a pseudo-random function of the orbit it belonged to.<br>
The distinguishing characteristic also respected the extra structure.<br>
<p>
<p>
This variant of the algorithm can be used with any curve but only<br>
rarely gives a speedup.  For that, it needs a pseudo-random function<br>
and a distinguishing characteristic which respect the orbit structure<br>
and can be computed quickly.  This can be done whenever points can be<br>
multiplied by some small-order roots of unity sufficiently quickly, by<br>
walking through the entire orbits under those multiplications.<br>
<p>
Our first implementation did so by repeatedly squaring the point<br>
coordinates in a polynomial basis, gaining a factor of five speed-up!<br>
The hint page put up by Certicom, <a href="http://www.certicom.ca/chal/note.htm">http://www.certicom.ca/chal/note.htm</a>,<br>
mentioned using a normal basis in which squaring is just a rotation;<br>
this gave a factor of seven.  In our final implementation we avoided<br>
walking through the orbits by instead using a population count in a<br>
normal basis, even though all arithmetic was in a polynomial basis,<br>
gaining a factor of ten.<br>
<p>
Our source code can be downloaded from:<br>

<p>
<p>
I would like to point out that the hint-page remark:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Recently, a successful solution to the ECCp-97 exercise was</i><br>
<i>&gt;submitted. The ECCK-95 exercise is easier, and suggests that not</i><br>
<i>&gt;everyone is aware of the speedups available for computing discrete</i><br>
<i>&gt;logs on a binary anomalous curve.</i><br>
<p>
strikes me as particularly disingenuous since when ECCp-97 was<br>
started, nobody yet knew how to speed up ECC2K-95.  It is all the more<br>
disingenuous that the "hint" is to change only the definition of<br>
distinguished points, which is not sufficient to get any speed-up at<br>
all (although the preprint added later fixed this).<br>
<p>
<p>
I would also like to thank Rob Zuccherato for sending his and Michael<br>
Wiener's paper, "Faster Attacks on Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems", in<br>
which they describe another algorithm: they keep an additive<br>
pseudo-random function, adapt it for orbits of points and propose a<br>
mechanism for getting rid of almost all of the short cycles that would<br>
otherwise cause problems.<br>
<p>
<p>
Finally, I draw the conclusion that cryptographic codes must no longer<br>
be based on the difficulty of discrete logarithms on curves defined<br>
over GF(2), since these logs are now demonstrably easier than on<br>
random curves and since it is not unlikely that much greater<br>
weaknesses will be discovered in future.<br>
<p>
