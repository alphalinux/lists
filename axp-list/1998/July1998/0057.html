This is true, it won't look too nice from behind.. but none of my<br>
my gear is much to look at anyhow. <br>
<p>

<p>
IDE is always slow. The drive won't be used to host /usr. The stuff<br>
I have planned for it is a ~1g archive (no, it isn't porn :) A lot of<br>
it is crypto related) of stuff that I'd like to free off of my pentium.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	3) It will take power away from your Multia PS, generating</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	   more heat.</i><br>
<p>
The power usage should be minimal.. the drive power shouldn't even need<br>
to be hook up, and the data lines won't pull that much.. <br>
<p>
Also, the main SCSI drive that was in the Multia is now in an external<br>
case (brainless PC case) getting powered from that p/s. Any power loss<br>
on the Multia side from the data lines gets more than offset by removal<br>
of that SCSI drive.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	4) You will probably have problems as your IDE cable starts</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	   to grow much beyond 18".</i><br>
<p>
Hmm.. why is IDE signal life shorter than a floppy drive? (or MFM HD..<br>
remember those?) I've ran data cabling of this sort longer than<br>
18" with no problems. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	5) Are you really that short on space...</i><br>
<p>
Not yet.. but I see the day when I will be. I'm planning on getting <br>
Mathematica and VariCAD for Linux/Intel for use on my Pentium. The<br>
HD requirements for those packages will push my Pentium over the<br>
edge. I can't get another drive in my Pentium (without investing in<br>
more equipment) and no spare drive that I have is sufficiently roomy<br>
to hold my current data and these two software packages. My solution<br>
is to let another machine host the bulk of my data, freeing the<br>
Pentium's drive up. The only machines that could pull that off for<br>
me are my notebook and the Multia. I have to opt for the Multia since<br>
I'm not the only one who uses the data, and my notebook is with me<br>
a lot.<br>
<p>
Other than the intrinsic hack value, I don't like the idea much, but<br>
I'd rather hack it all together with gear that I have than buy new<br>
junk just for archival. There are so many toys that are so much more<br>
fun, I'd rather buy them :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Did I say I didn't think this was a good idea? Just checking...</i><br>

I think you mentioned it :)<br>
