My advice would be to go SCSI if you possibly can. You have a lot of relatively<br>
inexpensive options:<br>
<p>
Pick up a used 4mm DAT or 8mm Exabyte drive. These can be found on sites such<br>
as:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.compsyscon.com">http://www.compsyscon.com</a><br>
<p>
Prices are in the range of $200-internal. I actually bought a couple of 8mm<br>
drives for $20 each but that was at a Wyoming State Surplus Property Warehouse,<br>
so unless you happen to be in the boonies you'll have to factor in travel (no,<br>
they don't do mail order). These things are temperamental but the usual<br>
problem, dirty heads, can be cured by most 13-year-old model train enthusiasts<br>
:-)<br>
<p>
I use a Conner CTMS-3200 scsi drive that uses QIC-3080XLF tapes to get 2Gb.<br>
native. The problem is that the tapes are expensive ($25-$30) and I don't know<br>
if the drive is still made. It has been reliable though, and only cost me $300<br>
new.<br>
<p>
I've seen some Seagate SCSI tape drives at $200-$300 prices in the catalogs. I<br>
don't know anything about them but Seagate is generally reliable (these days<br>
anyway) and they *are* SCSI.<br>
<p>
Parallel port solutions are iffy at best, and the drives that hang off the<br>
floppy controller are (in my experience) not reliable. Both are also *slow*.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Oh, one other thing.  The backup I was doing was onto a jaz, which I</i><br>
<i>&gt; was formatting in dos format so I could read it from a non-linux</i><br>
<i>&gt; machine.  I'm using mkdosfs which I got from the redhat contrib</i><br>
<i>&gt; directory, but it doesn't create fs's that linux recognizes.  Anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; know what's wrong or where I could get a working version?</i><br>
<p>
I wouldn't backup to a DOS format *anything*. The limitations on filenames<br>
alone would make that disasterous, to say nothing of lost ownership and<br>
permissions.<br>
<p>
I have formatted Jaz drives for DOS simply using mkfs -t msdos, but again I'd<br>
not do this for backup.<br>
<p>
Some friends of mine are backing up to IDE drives. IMHO this is risky because<br>
*when* the drive fails you are lost. With removable drives or tapes you can<br>
always put the media into a new drive. IDE drives are cheap though, and maybe<br>
if you used multiple ones this might be a good solution, certainly faster than<br>
tape.<br>
<p>
All just my $0.02 of course.<br>
