<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Since when did the X server, compilers, and browser become partof the OS?? They are important<br>
applications but certainly not<br>
part of the OS. Maybe you're thinking like someone else I won't<br>
mention here.<br>
I use a Matrox and an ATI RAGE II. Both work except for the 20<br>
windows problem. Though I don't use C++ in my line of work, I<br>
thought egcs 1.0.2 was working?? IDE does *work*, just not in<br>
DMA mode. Still haven't been able to confirm DMA mode in the<br>
2.1.xx kernels works on my systems yet though. Course, you could<br>
always put up the $50 for a NCR810 SCSI card. As far as browsers<br>
go, I agree it would be nice to have Netscape stable on Linux Alpha.<br>
For now, I use one of my PPro's. I guess because I run compute<br>
kernels most of the time on Alpha, I don't miss the browser there.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Once Linux/Alpha distributions have a stable environment in which people</i><br>

<i>&gt; machine and fix porting problems in applications.  But at the moment,</i><br>
<i>&gt; having used Linux/Alpha very happily for 5 months, I would not recommend</i><br>
<i>&gt; it to be used by anyone on a day-to-day basis.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
You've used it "happily" but don't recommend it. Seems a contradictionto me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In particular I'm disappointed at the X server stability (on my Matrox</i><br>
<i>&gt; card), and its tendency to sprag the machine at startup occasionally.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Yes I am on the latest version), and I'm disappointed at the complete</i><br>
<i>&gt; mess RH5.0 made of the compilers/C++ libraries.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Shouldn't live on the bleeding edge. If this bothers you, go back to RH4.2or wait for RH5.1. Are you<br>
using a Matrox Millenium II or the old<br>
card? Mine is the old card and it works fine. It's interesting to me that<br>
people just expect things to work for their HW setup. I usually go<br>
find out what works and only buy that to start with. Doesn't matter<br>
what OS/HW combination it is. That's pretty much the smartest<br>
way to go to minimize headaches later.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm happy to report bugs and try and fix them where I can; but I can</i><br>
<i>&gt; understand programmers who just want to fix/port their application and</i><br>
<i>&gt; basically expect the system and development software to be stable; when it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is it will move from a system suitable for people who want to play about</i><br>
<i>&gt; and fix deep and complex things, to the point where normal users and</i><br>
<i>&gt; programmers can just fix their applications.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Sorry, but its just not their yet.</i><br>
<p>
  Well, it's there enough for folks to buy 50-100 systems for compute<br>
farms so I guess I disagree with your conclusion.<br>
<p>
I'm personally waiting for the 21264 to arrive. My alpha's are slightly<br>
slower than my RS/6000's (397's). If I ran DU on them, they would<br>
outperform the RS/6000's but with a 21264, there's no doubt they<br>
will be the fastest microprocessor around. Course if you have millions<br>
of bucks, I could find something faster. I'm trying to keep the price<br>
tag a little lower.<br>
<p>
My $.02.<br>
