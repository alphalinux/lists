<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; 1) What does "appear to profile fine" have to do with "seems to convert</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    it to `-p'"?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The C program shows maybe 50 routines, with reasonable</i><br>
<i>&gt;looking cpu times.</i><br>
<p>
That seems completely unrelated.  `-p' clearly has nothing to<br>
do with the problem, since both cc1 and f771 -- *internal*<br>
programs for gcc and g77 -- get passed `-p' to enable profiling<br>
(even when *you* specify `-pg').  And they both share the bulk<br>
of their code, including much of their options processing and<br>
code generation (where profiling is mostly, if not entirely, handled).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; 2) Why isn't converting it to `-p' what you want to have happen?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;From what I've used in the past, '-p' is for prof, '-pg' is for</i><br>
<i>&gt;gprof, and only gprof exists on my system.</i><br>
<p>
You're talking about the gcc and g77 commands there.  What gcc and<br>
g77 accept for options is not always directly related to what<br>
the internal programs cc1 and f771 accept.  There are some similarities,<br>
but it's incorrect to assume that any option you pass to gcc or g77<br>
must necessarily be passed "unmolested" through to cc1 or f771<br>
(or cc1plus or cc1obj, etc.).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; 3) Are you sure gcc isn't doing the same thing -- converting `-pg'</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    to `-p'?  (It does on my box.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It may, but whatever gcc does, it seems to work.</i><br>
<p>
Yet, that's not what you said earlier.  You said the bug was that<br>
f771 was passed `-p', yet that's the same thing cc1 is passed,<br>
as you now verify.  I just don't think that's the bug, and<br>
your original reasoning as to why it was seemed clearly flawed<br>
to me, and, being unaccompanied by complete information on the<br>
problems you were encountering, made it difficult to guess as<br>
to what might be wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What g77</i><br>
<i>&gt;does doesn't. Only clues I have are the '-p' and the resulting</i><br>
<i>&gt;gprof output contains NO FORTRAN routine information.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps you should submit a bug report?  Both g77 and gcc come<br>
with extensive documentation, including on how and where to<br>
file bug reports.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Maybe FORTRAN</i><br>
<i>&gt;requires a MAIN routine to trigger the counting??</i><br>
<p>
That might be.  I don't know how profiling works in the gcc/g77<br>
environment (yet).  You might try making your own C version of<br>
the f/runtime/libF77/main.c file, compiling it with -pg, and<br>
linking it ahead of libf2c.a on the command line, and see if<br>
that helps.<br>
<p>
So this could just become Yet Another Reason Not To Put main()<br>
In A Library.  g77 already has a longish such list for libf2c<br>
improvements.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I do see that the C runtime</i><br>
<i>&gt;routine seems to be switched for profiling according to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the gcc specs file, gcrt1.o vs crt1.o.  By looking at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;specs, it appears '-p' and '-pg' do the same thing. So,</i><br>
<i>&gt;that leads back to how does FORTRAN hook up</i><br>
<i>&gt;profiling.</i><br>
<p>
See if `g77 -v -pg ...' reports the same kind of switching to<br>
gcrt1.o and such as does `gcc -v -pg ...' on your system.  If<br>
so, then I'd guess it's the main-not-compiled-with--pg problem<br>
suggested above.<br>
