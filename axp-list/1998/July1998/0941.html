I did get the latest images.  Same exact problem.  Except with one<br>
image, which didn't screw up the video, but also didn't do anything at<br>
all.  I just tried compiling aboot, didn't fully work, e2writeboot<br>
wouldn't compile...  the kernel (2.1.108) wouldn't compile for srm<br>
anyway, and I don't feel like commenting out any more kernel code.  If<br>
you ask me, I think that the alpha kernel code is very buggy in the 2.1<br>
kernels, I mean, they could at least make sure that everything there<br>
listed is defined before shipping off something that doesn't compile.<br>
Okay, I'm done ranting again.  For a little while.  The stress level is<br>
rising.  I need to keep the TGA card - it's too good not to use #1, and<br>
#2 we don't have anymore video cards to spare, and we are not able to<br>
buy anything right now.<br>

&gt;i've had some of the same troubles with my alpha station 400 4/233 with   
&gt;rh5.0.  i couldn't get reliable a boot from srm either, but it worked   
&gt;fine under arc.  try the latest images from the rh site.
&gt;
&gt;i also had trouble with my zlxp-e1 video card.  i don't know if you're   
&gt;tied to the card because you want to dual boot another unix that's   
&gt;configured for it, but i chucked the card and bought a 4mb pci s3 virge   
&gt;no name card from www.compgeeks.com for about $40.  rh found it all by   
&gt;itself and it works beautifully.

&gt;If your family thinks you're weird you're probably just intelligent.
