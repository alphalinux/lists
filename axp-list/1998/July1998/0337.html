<i>&gt;Craig, Wes, I mean no offense, BUT:</i><br>
<i>&gt;While I agree with elements of what both of you said, is it productive to</i><br>
<i>&gt;have this conversation in a public forum?</i><br>
<p>
It is, in a normal, professional forum; it is *often* done to<br>
ask people to clarify and properly re-file bug reports.<br>
<p>
It is rare for such a request to be treated with such contempt, and<br>
for some others who witness that contempt to claim that both people<br>
are equally at fault.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Feelings are getting hurt, tempers are beginniong to flare up, and mostly</i><br>
<i>&gt;because of the peer-exposed face-saving aspect of where you guys are going.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not trying to save face *at all*, and would appreciate it you<br>
would either be specific in your criticisms of my attempts to improve<br>
the quality of bug reports against products like g77, or simply<br>
avoid making them in the first place.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I think you both are right/wrong/mean well/strive for knowledge, and mostly</i><br>
<i>&gt;fighting through communications and "thinking-while-writing" issues.</i><br>
<p>
I disagree.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Consider this a virtual beer bought for you guys. Obviously you are both</i><br>
<i>&gt;very intelligent and hard-working individuals.</i><br>
<p>
That's a nice sentiment, but you left out "professional".  I believe<br>
I've conducted myself fairly professionally and ethically.  If you<br>
have *specific* criticisms of how I handled this, you're welcome<br>
to email me personally, but I believe my criticisms of the original<br>
bug report(s) were professional, and appropriate for this list, as a<br>
means to educate the list regarding how to properly formulate such<br>
bug reports.<br>
<p>
What exactly did I do wrong?  Take the statement "not what I want to<br>
have happen" as an indication that `-pg' might be incorrectly handled<br>
by g77?  Check it out on my Alpha platform, both in gcc and in g77,<br>
with `-v'?  Respond asking just *why* it was believed to be wrong?<br>
Also ask for more details on the behavior, and for them to be reported<br>
to the proper forum?  Or is it that you just don't like it when<br>
somebody stands up for themselves when told they can't read, instead<br>
of folding?  I mean, if you believe in the life philosophy "there are<br>
no right answers", then that's all the explanation I need for your<br>
stance; I don't believe in that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Now (PLEASE!) shake hands, return to your corners, step out at the bell,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and go chase some bugs in code, not each other..</i><br>
<p>
No thanks.  I'm not in this business to get into pissing matches about<br>
how to parse English, and don't appreciate having someone call into<br>
question my ability to do so; nor to have my, IMO, quite-valuable<br>
advice regarding how to submit bug reports and ask questions<br>
about software thrown back in my face like that.<br>
<p>
Had it been even *remotely* possible that I had misread the original<br>
bug report as such, I would have immediately spotted it and<br>
apologized, because that's what *I* do when I make goofs, either<br>
in public or private.  You can look up my recent posts in comp.lang.fortran<br>
if you don't believe me -- but then, you might *also* notice that people<br>
disagree by making specific, technical points, almost always in a<br>
profession manner there, and when a few don't, the rest of that audience<br>
has tended to object accordingly.  I feel no need to save face; I got over<br>
that kind of ego-boo some 15-20 years ago, and have definite recollections<br>
of how much of a time-waster, among other things, it was, and how<br>
widespread that tendency is (or was, anyway) among programmers.<br>
<p>
What I *was* on this list for was to provide up-front info, where<br>
needed, on the status of g77 for the Alpha, and to get the occasional<br>
heads-up on Alpha issues so as to properly maintain my machine.  I have<br>
some good support for the latter; since the former appears to no longer<br>
be welcome by present inhabitants of this list, at least coming from<br>
me, I'll unsubscribe now.  I've got too much email to read as it is<br>
anyway.  I believe there's at least one other g77 person reading<br>
this list, at least there used to be, so this should not be considered<br>
any great loss.<br>
