<P><EM>&gt; &gt; This is a hardware problem rather than an X problem. I have an ZLXp-E2 as

<EM>&gt; &gt; well running on an LX164, under Digital Unix, though. The problem is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; only the R and B signals are terminated with 50 Ohms on the graphics card.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The G signal has high impedance! Just solder a 50 Ohm resistor (47 will do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as well) between the G analog output of the card and GND and the shadows

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hey, that might be it.  I'm sure hoping you're right, because that's an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; easy fix. :)  Say, how did you confirm this, and where exactly did you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solder a resister? 
</EM><BR>
<P>I did confirm this be doing it myself :-) I mean: I had the same problem.
<BR>
I even posted it here and no one could help me. Then I took the card
<BR>
and measured the resistance between R-GND, G-GND and B-GND and only
<BR>
R-GND and B-GND had 50 Ohms as it should be. G-GND was high impedance.
<BR>
You might measure the resistance as well before starting to solder
<BR>
around on your card.
<BR>
<P>Alternatively if you have a metal SVGA connector which can be opened, 
<BR>
you could open the connector and try to solder the resistor in 
<BR>
there rather than on the card itself.
<BR>
<P>This is actually what Digital is apparently doing. They sell a
<BR>
special cable for this board which apparently has the resistor built
<BR>
in and &quot;magically&quot; makes the image look better!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; On the card itself, or between pins 2 and... wait,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which ground?  My pin assignment diagram shows three possibilities:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 5 - ground
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 7 - green ground
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 10 - shield ground
</EM><BR>
<P>Between G and &quot;green ground&quot; of course. Although all of these
<BR>
grounds are the same on the card.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Second question: there is &quot;tga_sync_green&quot; option in my SRM console.  One
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the trouble-shooting sections in the handbook says to use this option to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solve wavery/unstable image problems &quot;for three-wire monitors&quot;.  What is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; three-wire monitor?  Perhaps I should try this option and see if it makes a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difference?
</EM><BR>
<P>A three wire monitor is a monitor with Sync-in-Green. These are usually
<BR>
older workstation monitors (like the DEC VRT19-HA 19&quot;) which require
<BR>
the H and V sync signals on the green video line.
<BR>
<P>Most modern SVGA monitors have separate sync signals. Some can even
<BR>
work with both, separate sync and Sync in Green.
<BR>
<P>BTW: I was mistaken with the resistor value: I think it is 75 OHM and
<BR>
not 50OHM as I said in my previous e-mail. 50 OHM is the Ethernet
<BR>
cable impedance and 75OHM is the video cable impedance.
<BR>
<P>So try to measure R-GND and you could see 75 OHMs (with the monitor
<BR>
disconnected, of course). Then solder 75 OHMs as well between G and GND.
<BR>
<P>Hope this helps // Tom
