Hi everyone,
<BR>
<P>I'm trying to setup two network adaptors in one machine, which is a 
<BR>
Digital Workstation 500a. It has a onboard DC21142/3 ethernet adaptor. I 
<BR>
added in another PCI NetGear FA310TX w/ a DC21140 ethernet controller. 
<BR>
<P>My problem is this, when I boot the system, the onboard DC21142 
<BR>
controller dies. Both controllers are detected without a problem. 
<BR>
However, when the system begins to run inetd, the link light from the 
<BR>
DC21142 starts to flicker very fast, and then dies (no light). 
<BR>
<P>In ifconfig, it reports that both eth0 and eth1 are up and going... my 
<BR>
connection through eth0 (the Netgear DC21140) works fine. But eth1 
<BR>
doesn't work(onboard DC21142). I'm not sure what is happening. 
<BR>
<P>Has anyone had a similar experience? And how did you resolve it?
<BR>
<P>By the way, when I take out the Netgear card, the onboard DC21143 
<BR>
ethernet works fine... except it them becomes eth0 and not eth1. I 
<BR>
thought that was odd... I was expecting that the add-on Netgear card 
<BR>
would become eth1, but instead it took eth0... I've verified this by 
<BR>
noting the MAC addresses of the two controllers.
<BR>
<P>Also, I'm using the tulip drivers 0.58H and have them compiled into the 
<BR>
kernel (not modules).
<BR>
<P>Please send me any suggestions. I would really appreciate them. Thanks 
<BR>
in advance!
<BR>
<P>Masuda
