Hi Y'all,

<EM>&gt; Yes, but partitions dedicated for swap usually run faster. With an extended

<EM>&gt; partition and many logicals you pay no real penalty for this, other than a

<EM>&gt; rather large and confusing fdisk table..
</EM><BR>
<P>I figure that paging is darn slow and even _if_ paging to partitions is a
<BR>
little faster than to swap files, it's still just the difference between
<BR>
really really slow and really really really slow. :-)  
<BR>
<P>Anyway, how would one go about measuring the relative performance of swap 
<BR>
files and partitions?  In the absence of hard data, perhaps we might be
<BR>
able to start a war instead? The partitionists versus the swapfileans? ;-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Besides just how much swap can you really use?? If you are using a MB of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; swap, something is &quot;fishy&quot;..

<P>We run some fortran 77 codes (with static memory allocation). They tend to
<BR>
(pre)allocate lots (TM) of memory and while they may never use it all, Linux
<BR>
won't let them run unless it has at least as much virtual memory as the
<BR>
process might ever need.
<BR>
<P>If I watch some of these programs with `top', they might never be seen
<BR>
to use more than 25% of the memory they asked for at any one time. For
<BR>
them to take full advantage of (say) a 0.5GB machine they will need
<BR>
there to be 2GB of swap, at least! 
<BR>
<P>The joy of fortran 77, eh?
