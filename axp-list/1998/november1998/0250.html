<P>We upgraded to these a few days ago..before we considered
<BR>
upgrading to 2.1.x....so yes...it was with this that it was failing.
<BR>
Going back to the original milo resulted in exactly the same.
<BR>
It wasn't me that actually did it..so guess I will do so to make
<BR>
sure.
<BR>
<P>The kernel was only 100k bigger than the 2.0.35..does it make
<BR>
that much difference?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Just out of curiosity (we switched to LX's one month ago, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we are very happy with them :-) : is the &quot;Unable to handle paging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; request&quot; problem now solved with this Ruffian MILO?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And if yes, where was the problem?
</EM><BR>
<P>Havn't actaully seen one of these for a while...odd.
<BR>
Been getting a rather large amount of
<BR>
Whoops: unlock_buffer: async io complete on unlocked page
<BR>
lately tho :(...putting the process into an uninterruptable
<BR>
sleep permanently. Most annoying. At least that doesn't toast 
<BR>
the machine.
<BR>
<P>We tried the X server out which allows &gt;25 xterms....
<BR>
There hasn't been a single problem with that machine
<BR>
since it was done (1.5 days)...hmmm.
<BR>
<P>Just out of interest....
<BR>
Has anyone else noticed pipes or unix domain sockets
<BR>
being extremely slow compared to i386?
<BR>
I'm trying out 2.1.x to see if its any better.
<BR>
<P>Is there a recommended 2.1.x kernel for alpha? Can't
<BR>
afford to wait till christmas for 2.2 to arrive.
<BR>
<P>Tar.
