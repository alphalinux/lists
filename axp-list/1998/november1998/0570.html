<EM>&gt;hey all,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        question for all the HW gurus out there.. I have a UDB that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have not had any hardware problems with until now.  I got a hold of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;matrox millenium to put in my UDB, since I'm tired of 8bp color and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I've heard these cards work well/fit in the single PCI slot in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;UDB.  Well I recompiled the kernel etc. and got the video working from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Arc on to milo onto the login.. no problem.. The problem/error comes in @
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;random times, in random places.. I'll paste the errors at the end of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this email.  I've had this happen in Milo as well as once I've logged in.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;First off I pulled out the card and put it in my Intil box.. worked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fine.. no problems at all.  So I upgraded the Video bios on the card
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to the latest revision. Still worked beautifully in the Intel box.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Put it back in my UDB, and the problem still happened.. hmm...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Since I had to recompile the kernel, to take out TGA support, I had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;already Upgraded to the 2.0.36 kernel (compiled fairly cleanly btw).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And Since the problem first happened in milo, I decided it wasnt the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;kernel doing it. So since I had not upgraded my milo in ages.. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;grabbed Nikita Schmidt's new Milo images (since his web/ftp site were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unavailable, I pulled it out of the Loic Prylli's newest rescue disk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for the debian boot disks), saved my old copy of Milo and booted up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the new copy of milo (the changes look nice) but the problem persists.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This output happens in milo when I do something thats wrong.. like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'ls sda' instead of 'ls sda1'. it also happens a lot when I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;scrolling around in most or when some vt100/ncurses type screen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;movement occurs..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Other than a hardware fault (pci riser board maybe?), I'm stumped..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any suggestions to what I could try to resolve this would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;appreciated...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;well here is the Log output... thanks for reading this far.. heh

<P>Hi Phil,
<BR>
<P>I've seen the same problem on an AXPpci33 mainboard with a S3 Virge
<BR>
graphics board. I've since replaced that with an S3 864 card, and
<BR>
haven't seen the problem since. The Virge was a Virge/DX with 4 Mb of
<BR>
vid-ram, and otherwise worked flawlessly... Just not on the alpha.
<BR>
<P>Sorry if this doesn't help you much, I just wanted to let you know that 
<BR>
you aren't experiencing this alone.
<BR>
<P>Grtz,
<BR>
<P>Bas Vermeulen.

When I shop for hardware I always look for the &quot;Designed for Windows 95&quot; logo.
I really thank Microsoft(TM) for encouraging manufacturers to label their
products this way, so I know what to AVOID.
<P>I stick to quality software:
<P>Linux 2.0.36                        | IBM OS/2 Warp (TM) v4.0
