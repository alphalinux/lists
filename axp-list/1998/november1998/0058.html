<P><EM>&gt;     Hello everyone,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As written in the subject, I'm a newbye with alpha and moreover with linux.
</EM><BR>
<P>Welcome to the family :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; With the help of a friend, we were able to install RH 5.1.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then we were able to compile a new &quot;simple&quot; kernel (2.0.35)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My box is an AlphaPC164LX (with NT ARC console)
</EM><BR>
<P>Similar to mine - mine is an LX, but it has the AlphaBIOS rather than ARC.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But I still have problems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MILO and the system have difficulties to probe the IRQ : I mean it needs two
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or three attemps to detect my IDE Drives on each IRQ (14-15)
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeh thats not too uncommon; with pretty new 2.1 (I';m still running
<BR>
2.1.115) you can enable support for the IDE chip on the LX (a CMD646) -
<BR>
and it make sit start up cleaner and also gives you a decent transfer
<BR>
speed - your present speed will be pretty bad.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And it detects my ethernet card (based on the 21041 chipset) in the IRQ 18!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Under NT, this card is on the IRQ 3 (I know this is one of the IRQ for COM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but I don't care)
</EM><BR>
<P>The Alpha has a different Interrupt numbering scheme from PCs (I dont know
<BR>
what NT is doing...).  Typically you'll find that ISA style things
<BR>
(keyboard, PS/2 mouse etc) have similar IRQs that you expect on an Intel
<BR>
box, but PCI devices start from about 16 upwards.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Then the network stops working after 15-20 minutes (I can't say exactly).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The network part of the kernel wasn't compile as a module.
</EM><BR>
<P>Dont know that one - try and look in the logs to see what was going on.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The last final problem is with XFree. The S3 sever refuses to start with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 16bpp
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my video card is diamond Stealth 64 DRAM (PCI) with 1MB.
</EM><BR>
<P>1MB of RAM seems a bit mean to start 16bpp in? What resoloution were you
<BR>
trying to do that at? Can you also give us the error messages you were
<BR>
getting from XFree.
<BR>
<P>Dave
