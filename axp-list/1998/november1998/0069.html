<P>I have an SX164, which means I'm affected by the bad DMA code in the floppy
<BR>
driver in kernels 2.0.33 through 2.1.something.  When I got this box from
<BR>
Aspen Systems, they had 5.0 installed because they couldn't get 5.1 to work
<BR>
for some reason.  I installed 5.1 myself, but the partitions were already
<BR>
set up (i.e. MILO was installed) and I could boot from the CD, so I didn't
<BR>
have to fool around with the floppy.
<BR>
<P>I just ordered the RH 5.2 variety pack, and I'm assuming the CD I get is
<BR>
going to have the original ramdisk.img, and not this updated one, so I'm
<BR>
going to need to load the updated ramdisk.img from a floppy, which might
<BR>
be a problem if the sx164.img has a kernel that with the floppy drive
<BR>
bug.  I want to do a full reinstall and not just an upgrade because the
<BR>
Aspen folk set up the partitions in a way which is not to my taste and
<BR>
I would like to fix that.
<BR>
<P>So, here's my question:  I need to do a full reinstall, but I will need
<BR>
the new ramdisk.img.  Does anyone know if the sx164.img has a kernel with
<BR>
a working floppy driver, or am I going to have problems?
