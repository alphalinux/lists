<EM>&gt;Sorry, I didn't think to keep a copy and he did not return
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a quote.  I did try to paraphrase my message.  It was only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;three lines of text I sent and I think I was polite.  I did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;point out that placing an ad under the wrong heading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;could backfire on him.  Yes more people will see it but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;what will they think when they do?  I did not even tell him
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not to do what he did.  I don't even think what he did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;crosses the line to being SPAM.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Most email programs keep a 'sent items' folder.  It does seem that internet
<BR>
marketers are getting more belligerent.  If you read the print at the
<BR>
bottom of a recent spam, if you don't exactly follow their procedure to the
<BR>
letter, you aren't off their list.  And they don't take kindly to any mail
<BR>
bomb, either.
<BR>
<P>The spammers probably have to run a tight computing ship, as a spammer is
<BR>
likely to tick off a proficient cracker once in a while, never mind the
<BR>
masses of general 'linux hackers' - the kind that know their way around
<BR>
protocols enough to screw people over.  Enough so that they can find the
<BR>
REAL originating computer and down it - regardless of OS.  Maybe this is
<BR>
why spammers tend to AOL subscribers...
<BR>
<P>But this doesn't get to the real heart of the problem - people can be real
<BR>
jerks, and others powerless to do anything about it.
