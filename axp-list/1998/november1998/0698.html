<P>
I have a similar system, but I've had no drive problems.  The only problem
<BR>
I have is getting the built-in tulip chip to work on 2.1.129. Maybe Loic's
<BR>
patches don't work on exp. kernels?
<BR>
<P>As for the keyboard locking out on you, I had to 'correct' the sound
<BR>
configuration on 2.0.35.  Don't ask, I have no clue why....
<BR>
<P>What compiler?  egcs-1.1 and up seem to have a bit of trouble generating
<BR>
totally stable code.  They won't compile a certain module in 2.0.36, and
<BR>
the X SVGA server trashes the console, the only fix is a soft boot.
<BR>
<P>JRDM
<BR>
<P>Some comments on what others wrote (some clipping):
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Hey... I'm running RH5.2 with 2.0.35 and I'm having some similar 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problems too... see below...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;	Has anyone gotten the 2.1.129 kernel to run successfully on the Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;PWS Miata?  I tried to use it and there are some real problems:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;	1) takes forever to mount local partitions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've had this problem since day one when I installed RH5.2... at first I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thought it might be a problem with my SCSI... but now that I'm not the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only one.... hmmm... anyways.. yes, it takes about 2 to 3 minutes just 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to mount my root partition.... on a similar Intel system, it takes less 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than 10 seconds.....
</EM><BR>
<P>It would help to know if you've tried RH5.1, and make sure you are sure
<BR>
the SCSI system is connected and terminated correctly.  Do you have a
<BR>
QLogic or Adaptec SCSI?  The Qlogic ones gave me trouble.  I heard they
<BR>
are better, but at that time, Linux's support for it &amp; PWS wasn't good.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;	3) does something bad so that after I ctrl-alt-del and go back to milo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and run a good kernel, the keyboard is disabled and the cd-rom flakes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yup, I've also had this problem since day one.... if I reboot from 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MILO... my system hangs during boot... if I cold boot it (reset 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; switch)... I'm fine.... My system is total SCSI... 
</EM><BR>
<P>My situation isn't as severe that I remember, but I get some similar
<BR>
problems on a soft (warm) reset of an experimental kernel.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;	These behaviors seem odd since the kernel is supposed to be reasonably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;stable...
</EM><BR>
<P>Ditto.
<BR>
