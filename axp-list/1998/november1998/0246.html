<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; You're assuming that -mieee makes a big difference in library
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; run-time. I suspect it doesn't, since it doesn't have that many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; floating point ops in it, and when it does, it does expensive things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; anyway, like converting to ascii and back.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; As I said, those that want it should have their own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; version. Those that don't should not get it in their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; code path.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So let me get this straight: you think that even if there is no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difference in CPU time consumed, someone should still spend human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effort to make this &quot;feature&quot; available, when nobody needs it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Since the libraries are apparently NOT compiled with
<BR>
-mieee, which is how this thread started, it seems
<BR>
the addition of -mieee is creating the extra labor.
<BR>
In fact, I believe this is the first piece of SW
<BR>
that someone complained was having FPE's in the G77
<BR>
libraries on this list. That statement in itself 
<BR>
indicates there must be FP calculations in the library,
<BR>
which in turn means -mieee is not &quot;free&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Be that as it may, the solution for DgncppB is to either
<BR>
determine how the code generated data that causes the FPE
<BR>
in LIBI77 or, since it's a problem specific to that code,
<BR>
rebuild egcs with the -mieee flag active for the library
<BR>
and see if that helps. Note using -mieee does not guarantee
<BR>
FPE's go away.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Ask yourself how many customers would pay you to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; produce a NaN for them....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Many legitimate algorithms use IEEE in interesting ways to produce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fast answers -- there are NaN's along the way, but the final answer is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right. Just because you don't use such algorithms doesn't mean other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people shouldn't use them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Interesting statement. If you have time, please give
<BR>
a brief description of how one example would do this, 
<BR>
preferably off line since I'm not sure anyone else 
<BR>
cares about this discussion.
