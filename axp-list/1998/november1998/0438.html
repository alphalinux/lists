<P>
I saw one of Landon's ads in a news group.  It seemed to me that he
<BR>
was posting to the wrong group.  I pointed this out and said that
<BR>
this could prove counter productive.  Misclasifing your own products
<BR>
could be a sign that you are a little unknowagable.  It seems my note
<BR>
greatly upset this person.  He is in the bussiness of selling computers.
<BR>
One would think he would care more about his image.  I do think he
<BR>
among all vendors I spoke with had the most unique way of telling me
<BR>
that he did in fact have a Sun Workstation that I was shopping for.
<BR>
<P>Please read his replies to my note. He sent two to me and another
<BR>
to &quot;both my offices&quot; (where ever that is?)  You all judge him for
<BR>
yourself and decide if you would'd like to do business with him.
<BR>
I have no argument with the content of his messages.  I will even
<BR>
stipulate that everything he says is true.  I am simply passing it
<BR>
on unedited.  You can judge him by his own words. 
<BR>
<P>This person advertises in newsgroups like 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;misc.forsale.computers.workstation  with a subject line
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;computers for sale&quot; and a from line &quot;Landon S. Von G&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;his web site is: &quot;www.jps.net/vongogh1&quot;.
<BR>
<P>He may have some good deals check out the web site.

<EM>&gt; You know there is plenty of room in each newsgroup for everyone. If you're not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interested in someone's posting then just pass to the next one. There isn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any need to put others down. Besides ASS HOLE, I am able to provide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; workstations, Sun Microsystems etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You prick!!

<EM>&gt; Human Resources Dept @ 310-645-1122.

<EM>&gt; You should be a little more smarter, little man!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You left your signature on your email with your name, work email, work phone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and fax. I just got down emailing logicon a complaint about you and in a few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; minutes I plan on making a phone call about you. So I suggest you pipe down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and leave innocent people alone. You're messing with the wrong person. Do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you have any more threats? If you do, do them now before I make my phone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; call, Mr. Chris Albertson with Logicon RDA with the following info:
