<EM>&gt; sockets as a way to avoid bad connections. This was the mil spec at the time. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was always suspicious that only after the computer explosion and chips were in

<EM>&gt; short supply did the vendors warn everybody about the dangers of using gold
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connectors with tin chips instead of the tin sockets they happened to have in

<EM>&gt; stock. I personally don't put much stock in the dissimilar metal theory, since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the whole reason for using the gold was that it is electrochemically inert (at

<EM>&gt; least thats what I learned in my graduate electrochemistry course).

<P>As I understand it, galvanic corrosion between two metals when one
<BR>
metal is more noble that the other.  The noble metal may not suffer
<BR>
corrosion, but the less noble metal will waste away.
<BR>
<P>I am employed in the marine industry, and galvanic corrosion is a real
<BR>
problem.  One has to be careful to design systems to avoid galvanic
<BR>
corrosion when exposed to seawater (an excellent electrolyte).  One
<BR>
wants to use components that are similar in nobility, or else corrosion
<BR>
will occur on the less noble surface.  Sometimes this is employed to
<BR>
advantage, for instance, the use of zinc anodes on a steel hull to
<BR>
prevent corrosion of the steel in seawater.  Since zinc is less noble
<BR>
than steel, the anodes waste away instead of the hull.
