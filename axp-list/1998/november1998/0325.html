<EM>&gt; I've used gold plated ram in tin sockets with no troubles.  It would be the tin that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would have the corrosion but I suspect it would be very slow.  Might be worse in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; humid surroundings but most computers are in ac these days. I have seen it on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power connectors more often, tho.  As a matter of fact, one MircoVax Box (BA23) had a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power connector that would corrode ever so slightly but the corrosion would cause RF
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interference that would show up as memory errors or bus errors and would affect the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tape drive.  Replaceing that power connector would solve the problem.  The old ones
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had a tendency to over heat also, due to the corrosion.  That was under a heavy load
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tho.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats consistent since we are talking about galvanic corrosion. The 
<BR>
higher the current the faster the corrosion.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think you've hit on the solution.  Let's just attach a hunk of zink to the case and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; put it in salt water.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually there is a product sold under the name of Tweak, I think it 
<BR>
was originally patented under the name Stabilant, that decreases 
<BR>
contact resistance while increasing corrosion resistance. It is a 
<BR>
weird polymer that only conducts under pressure, so only the points 
<BR>
of contact in a multicontact socket conduct. The original demo of it 
<BR>
had a tv set immersed totally and running at the time. It is rather 
<BR>
expensive but you only need a drop or two per connection/socket. So a 
<BR>
drop of this on the simm socket should work wonders for those who are 
<BR>
worried. Look for it at high end audio stores.
