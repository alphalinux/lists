<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current kernel (generic) framebuffer code won't work on
<BR>
alphas.  It has some memory access ... methods ... that aren't very
<BR>
portable.  (note that the TGA framebuffer works because it bypasses all of
<BR>
these generic functions)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is currently a matroxfb in development which provides
<BR>
partial acceleration for the console framebuffer.  It can be found in the
<BR>
cvs right now, and will probably be a part of 2.1.129.  It doesn't work on
<BR>
Alphas at the moment, but I'm working with the author to remedy that
<BR>
situation; Petr has been very helpful and cooperative so far.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distant past, GGI patched the kernel in order to work. 
<BR>
With the inclusion of the framebuffer stuff, patches are no longer
<BR>
necessary.  It builds kgicon, a module which connects to the fbcon
<BR>
interface to provide its functionality but also provides the functionality
<BR>
of kgi -- the ggi Kernel Graphics Interface.  Unlike the kernel
<BR>
framebuffer setup, KGI has the ability to accelerate all parts of 2D video
<BR>
display (i.e., when complete it could give X a run for its money).  3D
<BR>
support is also in the works.  There is currently an XGGI which uses the
<BR>
ggi access routines to provide accelerated video for all ggi-supported
<BR>
cards.  Matrox support is pretty good. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, ggi has io memory (mmio) access problems similar to that
<BR>
of the kernel framebuffer console drivers.  I am currently working with
<BR>
the GGI folks to remedy this situation as well.  However, this is a
<BR>
slightly larger undertaking than fixing matroxfb and is moving along more
<BR>
slowly.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most GGI programs (including XGGI) use libggi for graphics
<BR>
routines.  Libggi has support for various targets.  One is direct console
<BR>
drawing via. kgi, another is the normal kernel framebuffer (fbcon), and
<BR>
the third is an X window.  The client program doesn't know or care which
<BR>
of these it's talking to.  An svgalib wrapper for GGI exists, and I
<BR>
believe it to work on Alphas (though I haven't tried).  Therefore, you can
<BR>
run svgalib programs in an X window.  If I ever get kgi working, you could
<BR>
also run those from the console.  If you have a TGA card, libggi has been
<BR>
reported to work with TGAfb.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the record, I have a Matrox Millenium II with 4MB of vram, I
<BR>
normally use the standard linux text console and/or XF86_SVGA.  If I ever
<BR>
get GGI working right, that may change.  I have an sx164, 533MHz.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're willing to test / code / anything, lemme know.  To the
<BR>
best of my knowledge, I'm the only one working on either of these for
<BR>
Alphas, and I'm in a rut with the code (for both systems) right now.  I
<BR>
could use all the help I can get.

<P><EM>&gt; Ok...  all this talk of framebuffers has me a bit miffed...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; #1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	Its just a framebuffer...  What about hardware acceleration?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; #2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	is this what GGI is?  Acceleration in addition to framebuffers?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if so why are we doing FB support?  Simplicity?  Is GGI next?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How does GGI work?  I was reading about simplified kernel drives...  So
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they only include the basics to keep the card in a usable state in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kernel...  What happens to the rest of the functions... do I still need an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SUID root program to access them?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I ask all this because I run a Matrox at 1600x1200 in X with the martox 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; x server and a framebuffer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; console...  I guess this only works on 1 or 2 cards because the card is in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MMIO mode in console which most X drivers aren't ready for.  I though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about switching to the FB X server but thought about it and realized how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much acceleration I would loose...  So I guess I am just lucky?
