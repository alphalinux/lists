<P><EM>&gt; I just looked inside one of my AS200's, and it looked like the PCI/ISA slots
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were gold plated, but it wasn't real obvious that the SIMM sockets were gold. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; couldn't see the SIMM's themselves.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've always been puzzled by this subject. I can remember in ancient times when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I started building a few single board computers from bare boards. The guys who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were really intense at the time (mostly SS-50 bus believers) swore by all gold
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sockets as a way to avoid bad connections. This was the mil spec at the time. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was always suspicious that only after the computer explosion and chips were in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; short supply did the vendors warn everybody about the dangers of using gold
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connectors with tin chips instead of the tin sockets they happened to have in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stock. I personally don't put much stock in the dissimilar metal theory, since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the whole reason for using the gold was that it is electrochemically inert (at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; least thats what I learned in my graduate electrochemistry course).
</EM><BR>
<P>Not entirely inert.  Gold has no native oxide, yes.  Gold corrodes very,
<BR>
very slowly, yes, although I think faster than diamonds devolve to an
<BR>
ordinary lump of carbon. Tin, though does have a native oxide, and it does
<BR>
corrode.  Therefore, there is some concern there.  If you want to slap
<BR>
some RAM and not worry about ever taking the case apart, there may be
<BR>
some concern, but I usually take computer cases apart once per year to
<BR>
cast out the dust anyways.
<BR>
<P>Another question: for the electronic contacts in a computer, would using
<BR>
a little silicone grease affect the life of the parts or corrosion either
<BR>
way?

<EM>&gt; &gt; Hello,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;         With the recent discussion about gold vs. tin SIMM and socket
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; plating, my curiousity is raised about the AlphaStation 200.  Does anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; know if the SIMM sockets in it are tin or gold?  Also, I would assume that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the memory which was shipped with it (16M installed and 16M upgrade kit)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would be of the same plating type, but.....?  I have one, but I do not have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; physical access to it at the moment.
