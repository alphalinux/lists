<P>
Does anyone know what this message indicates (this is the full
<BR>
printout from the syslog:
<BR>
<P>Nov 30 11:09:44 gamma kernel: Unable to load interpreter
<BR>
<P>I am suddenly getting these messages on two LX machines under medium to
<BR>
high load.  One of the machines just had some hardware trouble, so
<BR>
I'd be willing to accept that there is still something going on there,
<BR>
but the other machine was extremely stable and NOTHING was changed
<BR>
hard- or softwarewise.  As soon as one gets these messages, every
<BR>
program one attempts to start segfaults; pretty soon one has to
<BR>
hit the reboot button.
<BR>
<P>These machines are running RH 5.1 with pretty much all patches applied,
<BR>
milo is the RH 5.1 one, the kernel is 2.0.35 compiled from the
<BR>
Redhat sources.  (I am willing to compile a kernel from pristine sources,
<BR>
but note that this kernel worked fine for the last months.)
<BR>
<P>A simple test to reproduce my problem is the memory tester which
<BR>
Dave Gilbert posted to this group a while ago, it runs fine (no bad
<BR>
memory is reported, but after an hour these messages start to appear)
<BR>
<P>I should add that both machines have Adaptec SCSI adapters (one an
<BR>
2940U, the other the 2940UW), and our real applications do a lot of
<BR>
heavy duty disk I/O.  I have had no problems with these; on the other
<BR>
hand, several people seem to have had problems with 2.0.35 and the
<BR>
Adaptec driver.  So, I'd also appreciate if people would comment on
<BR>
which combination (kernel, Adaptec driver version, alpha-patches runs
<BR>
well for them).
<BR>
<P>Many thanks,
<BR>
<P>Stefan Boresch
