<P><EM>&gt; &lt;!-- Is Qt totay free?  Is there any differance from GPL'd code?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Previously, Troll released two versions: a commercial development
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; package for commercial apps, and the &quot;personal&quot; edition.  It comes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with source, so you can hack it, but not redistribute it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The new Qt free is under something they've dubbed the QPL, and appears
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be GPL compliant.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not quite, it's not GPL (or LGPL), but it qualifies as an open-source
<BR>
license according to Eric Raymond (esr), who's widely recognized as the
<BR>
open-source authority.
<BR>
<P>The main difference between QPL and LGPL is that commercial apps can't link
<BR>
to Qt under QPL.  They need to link to Qt professional, which is a
<BR>
completely different license (identical product though).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This makes for an interesting situation: how will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Redhat handle the cries for KDE inclusion now?
</EM><BR>
<P>An interesting question.  Looking at the RedHat Qt-problems press release,
<BR>
the QPL-LGPL difference I cited above was one reason RedHat gave for not
<BR>
including KDE.  To quote the press release:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to the LGPL, the Qt license requires you to pay
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;substantial license fees if you develop and sell commercial
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;applications that dynamically link against Qt. Specifically, if
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you link your software with Qt, your software must be distributed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under the GPL or LGPL, or it must allow free modification and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distribution of the source. This effectively says &quot;your software
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must be Open Source even though ours is not&quot;, and curiously means
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that if you distributed your software under the Qt license you
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would not be able to link with Qt!
<BR>
<P>(<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/redhat/qtlicense.html">http://www.redhat.com/redhat/qtlicense.html</A>)  This hasn't changed, so
<BR>
RedHat probably won't either.  The last sentence raises an interesting
<BR>
contradiction with one part of the Open Source definition:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Derived Works
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the original software.
<BR>
<P>(<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html">http://www.opensource.org/osd.html</A>)  A couple of critics have raised this
<BR>
an an open-source problem with even the new QPL.  But then, if the new QPL
<BR>
is open-source enough for esr, it's open source enough for me!
<BR>
<P>Conclusions: there remain substantial differences between QPL and LGPL, one
<BR>
of which was cited as a reason RedHat wouldn't distribute KDE, so until the
<BR>
license changes further, we probably won't see KDE in RedHat.
<BR>
<P>However, the Mandrake distribution is essentially RedHat with KDE, and 5.2
<BR>
will be out very soon (though I don't know whether it exists for alpha).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Too much bandwidth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has already died due to Gnome vs. KDE talk, so no more flame wars.
</EM><BR>
<P>No flames, just data.
<BR>
<P>Personal note: I use GNOME because it lets me use Enlightenment, and have
<BR>
never used KDE, so I'm not entirely unbiased.
