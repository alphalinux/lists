<P>No, UFS filesystems do not need to be involved unless you're dual-booting
<BR>
an operating system other than Linux (which requires them).
<BR>
<P>A possible problem.. the 30MB partition; does it start on the beginning of
<BR>
the disk?  And did you put the kernel on that partition and run swriteboot?
<BR>
I believe that will corrupt your filesystem.  I think you would have needed
<BR>
to use e2writeboot for that case.  But there is a more preferred method,
<BR>
and that is to donate an entire partition (or void space, before a
<BR>
partition) to aboot.  If you want to &quot;donate&quot; your 30MB partition, you
<BR>
would just blast it, put the kernel on some other partition (you'd need to
<BR>
split your 30MB in two) and then run swriteboot on the disk.
<BR>
<P>Good luck,
