<EM>&gt; With regards to your message at 12:48 PM 11-19-98 -0500, Greg Lindahl.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Where you stated:
</EM><BR>
&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; Do I really have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; make 8 swap partitions in order to have 1gb of swap space? If I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; then how do I mount the 1gb partition to be a swap only partition.
</EM><BR>
&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, but partitions dedicated for swap usually run faster. With an extended
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; partition and many logicals you pay no real penalty for this, other than a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rather large and confusing fdisk table..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Besides just how much swap can you really use?? If you are using a MB of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; swap, something is &quot;fishy&quot;..
</EM><BR>
<P>I once supported an application that told users to allocate 2 Gigabytes
<BR>
of
<BR>
swap on their Sun server - the server itself had 512 Megabytes of RAM.
<BR>
Well, one day I got a call from a client that wanted to know why my
<BR>
company
<BR>
was telling him to allocate a 2 GB swap file? I went to the developers 
<BR>
and asked them why they needed that much swap, and the short answer was,
<BR>
&quot;the common rule of thumb for swap space is 2x actual RAM, 3x for busy
<BR>
server applications, and since this was a *really* important application
<BR>
they increased it to 4x actual RAM.&quot;  Neither the client nor I liked
<BR>
that
<BR>
answer, and the client went with 1x actual RAM and never had a
<BR>
problem...
<BR>
<P>The reason the client called was becuase the Sun Field Engineer that was
<BR>
installing and configuring their RAID hardware couldn't understand why
<BR>
any application needed 2 gigabytes of swap - in all his years with Sun
<BR>
he
<BR>
had never seen such a thing outside of incredible high-end
<BR>
applications...
<BR>
The developers, it seems, had a high opinion of their code... 
<BR>
<P>What the developers never realized was that this &quot;rule of thumb&quot; was
<BR>
invented when a big server had 128 Meg of RAM!
<BR>
<P>Thought this might be interesting to some...
