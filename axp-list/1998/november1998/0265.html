If this is a repeat, sorry.  I never saw that it was posted.

<EM>&gt; &gt;   I bought four 8MB 72pin 36-bit SIMMs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;                             ^^^^^^
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This should be just fine--as I read it, 36-bit SIMMs equals parity SIMMs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm surprised it didn't work.
</EM><BR>
<P>36 bit doesn't mean parity.  Some ram is sold as parity but it has a non-ram chip
<BR>
that fools some computers into thinking the ram is parity and is good.  A computer
<BR>
that really tests the parity isn't fooled and doesn't boot.  I've heard the fake
<BR>
parity called logic parity but to me it's just a scam because it costs the same as
<BR>
parity and often the fake chip has markings of a ram chip.  I get burned by that all
<BR>
the time.  I ask for true parity and get that crap and have to send it back.  They
<BR>
then say it's good and I have to explain all this to them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Let's see, Chris, you also mention 24
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; identical chips--12 on each side...  Are you sure?  My guess is that of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 24 chips, you have
</EM><BR>
<P>24 chips might be a form of ECC memory.  I recall only 20 chips but there might be
<BR>
more depending on what chips they use I guess.  ECC will not work as parity but will
<BR>
work as standard ram in most cases.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    - 8 1x4Mbit (or 4x1Mbit) chips on side A (4MB, no parity)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    - 8 1x4Mbit (or 4x1Mbit) chips on side B (4MB, no parity)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    - 4 1x1Mbit chips on side A (one-half of the 8Mbit (1MByte) for parity)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    - 4 1x1Mbit chips on side B (the other half of the 8Mbit (1MByte) for parity)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, if you look closely, you should see that four of the chips on each side
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually have a different part number.  This should still be just fine,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as it works out to 8MB with parity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Moreover, some people said you needed ECC memory instead of parity.  That's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bogus.  As far as I know, there is no such thing as ECC memory in 72pin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; format--use parity (36-bit memory as it's advertized), and let the Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use it as a 72 bit data path, generating 8 bits of ECC for each 64 bits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of data.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is ECC memory in 72 pin format.  Some MicroVAX's use it.  The Multia doesn't
<BR>
use ECC though.  Ask for true parity and make sure they know what you mean by that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   Next I round up some 30 pin SIMMS and a pair of 30 -&gt; 72 pin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   converters.  I put this in and now I see something on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   monitor.  It is all green with a white block cursor on the lower
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   left.  But that's it.  The machine is totally unresponsive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   Waiting doe not seem to help after 30 minutes it is the same.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The fact that you get somewhere with the 30 pin SIMMS suggests that maybe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 72pin memory that you said you had isn't working. (??)  I don't know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what to make of this unless somehow, the 8MB SIMMs you have aren't really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parity (despite my &quot;chip counting&quot; above), or are bad or something.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The white block cursor in the lower left is an indication that your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; battery is dead.  At least that's what it did for me.  When I unplugged
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the battery cube and tested it, it read 1.05V.  I replaced it and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; booting commenced.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   Is something other then generic 36-bit RAM required?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's what I am using.  I have tried generic 36-bit 8MB, 16MB, and 32MB
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SIMMs--all have worked perfectly.  If you want, copy down the exact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; numbers and letters on all the chips on each side of each SIMM, (email
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me privately), and I'll look up exactly what you've got.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 2) The machine came with a 4.5V clock battery.  Does anyone know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   how to check it.  It measures 4.5V under no load condition but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   I know this is a poor way o test.  Or should I assume the little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   cube shaped thing is dead and replace it.  I assume a could use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   three AA batteries in series.  Any problem with this idea?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As someone said, if it reads 4.5V under no load, it should be okay.  My
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dead one only registered 1.05V.  But if you get the solid block cursor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the lower left, that sounds like a dead one too.  I believe you can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; try to boot without the battery installed--you'll just have to reset
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the clock every time you power off.  You could try this just to see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you get further.  If you do, replace the battery anyway.
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; P.S.  Please don't flame me for my big parity memory analysis--I'm a math
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dork.
</EM><BR>
<P>No flaming intended.  I know more about ram than I do Linux so it was my chance to
<BR>
educate.
