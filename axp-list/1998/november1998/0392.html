<EM>&gt;PPros can be bumped upto 200 Mhz with no sweat (proper heat mitigation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;required)
</EM><BR>
<P>Not only that, you can get the pII XEON upgrade chips for PPRo boards in
<BR>
the future (333 mhz w/512k of L2 cache running at processor speed).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;1) I *think* the celeron is SMP capable, but I don't know...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Stock Celeron is NOT SMP capable. However, if you are willing to *DRILL*
<BR>
the chips and rewire it a little bit, it can be made SMP capable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;2) No cache is not a problem, if your RAM is fast enough, but the PPro
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   has a 256K cache vs. 0 in Celeron...
</EM><BR>
<P>Cache DOES matter, espescially in a SMP environment, since both processors
<BR>
are sharing the same RAM. 
<BR>
<P>Also, there are two other options. If you really don't mind getting your
<BR>
hands dirty, buy a celeron 300a for around $150, they come with 128k of
<BR>
integrated L2 cache running at processor speed (think mini-XEON). Not only
<BR>
that, but you can overclock them to 450 mhz without a problem.
<BR>
<P>Or, get a PPRO 166 cpu w/512k of cache and overclock it to 200 mhz.. This
<BR>
what I did. I bought a motherboard from centrix-intl.com for $115 with
<BR>
integrated ultrascsi (or if you already have it, they have a dual-processor
<BR>
board available for $50 without SCSI). I bought the CPU's for $100 each. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The CPUs would be cheaper, the perfomance would be a bit more, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;motherboard would be a lot more expensive (twice the price?) If you really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;think you will upgrade the machine during it's likely service life, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;investment in a PII SMP machine is a good idea, if you want a darn fast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;smp box without spending a lot of money, the PPro is a very good choice,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;IMHO...

<P>They may be better off buying a dual-capable motherboard and a single
<BR>
PII-333 for $250's a processor. Then you have an upgrade path, and it
<BR>
didn't cost you an arm and a leg.
