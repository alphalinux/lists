<EM>&gt; By the way, to bob who replied below... how did you figure out what was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wrong with the code? Or did you read all of the code and stumbled on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that problem?
</EM><BR>
<P>I used RH5.1 on an Intel machine and did masquerading.  But, after that
<BR>
machine died, I decided to get an Alpha.  I spent several days fiddling with
<BR>
ipfwadm trying to get it to work, saying to myself, &quot;I *know* this should
<BR>
work, but it isn't....&quot; :-)
<BR>
<P>I decided to search the web to see if anyone else had problems like this.
<BR>
The only article I found was dated in August of this year (sorry, I forgot
<BR>
the author's name and where it was located).  The author had said that
<BR>
it appeared as if the ip_fw structure was not correct and was dependant
<BR>
upon a 32-bit architecture.  I just changed the 2 32-bit declarations
<BR>
so they would be correct on a 64-bit architecture.  I recompiled the
<BR>
kernel and ipfwadm, and that did the trick.
