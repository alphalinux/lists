Oachkatzlschwoaf !<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have decided to go with SCSI instead of IDE.  I have not used SCSI</i><br>
<i>&gt; before.. I wanted the 2940UW but settled for a Diamond Fireport 40. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; also picked up (2) - 1G IBM hard drives without documentation. Any one</i><br>
<i>&gt; with knowleged as to where to find info would be appreciated. I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; searching IBM now.</i><br>
<p>
www.storage.ibm.com ?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, I got some conflicting statements today about SCSI configuration.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The manual tells me to set boot drive to ID 0. The guy at the computer</i><br>
<i>&gt; store said the higher the number the higher the priority. What is best</i><br>
<i>&gt; the best solution? I still have to figure out how these are jumpered</i><br>
<i>&gt; too.</i><br>
<p>
These statements are not conflicting ones.<br>
IBM is the only company that does "right" SCSI-Setup... <br>
So the 1. Harddisk has id 6 in some IBM configurations.<br>
All other people in the world use ID 0: for the first drive.<br>
This has lowest priority but this has really no effect at all.<br>
<p>
An (bad ?) example: If you have an old streamer without<br>
           disconnect/reconnect support it maybe loose<br>
           the "selection war" if it has a lower SCSI-ID.<br>
           But if the streamer wins the selection (maybe because<br>
           no other device wants the bus at moment) nobody can <br>
           interrupt it until the next bus free phase (after fully<br>
           completing a rewind or unload (immed bit not set). command)<br>
           So a device with a lower id may block higher priority<br>
           devices, (maybe 30 sec or more) too. But for shure, <br>
           if multiple devices want<br>
           the bus (if the bus is free), the one with the higher id <br>
           gets it. It would be theoretically possible that a device<br>
           never gets the bus because of priority (low id); so to <br>
           give at least the host adapter(s) the higest possible <br>
           is a good reason.<br>
<p>
I really suggest to use id 0 for the first harddrive and so on.<br>
It's not worth to care about selection priority in 99.9999% of<br>
all cases, and most people will do it that way. (This is not<br>
a real argument !)<br>
<p>
There is another good reason to use "target ID's from 0 up" scheme.<br>
With this scheme (I used it for all systems I ever build)<br>
I know that the first disk has always ID 0.<br>
<p>
This doesn't work for IBM's "ID 6" down scheme for a simple reason:<br>
On multi-initiatior environments (if you want to connect a SCSI disk<br>
to multiple host adapters (machines) at the same time) the disk<br>
should have ID 5, because high id's are of interest for host<br>
adapters.<br>
<p>
  ciao -<br>

PS.: I hope that you are totally confused now ;-} <br>
