Well a lot depends on where you are located. Earthlink is a nation-wide ISP but<br>
a lot of local and regional ones offer ISDN. Bell Atlantic offers ISDN service<br>
as do most of the RBOCs. With the virtual line systems<br>
required to support the "56K" modems just about any modern ISP has the<br>
capability of supporting ISDN with little or no additional trouble.<br>
<p>
Also, be careful about spending money on an ISDN solution if something better<br>
is coming to your area soon. I live in New Jersey and we are supposed to be<br>
getting ADSL service next month, up to 7.1Mb. download speed and 400K<br>
upstream for *much* less than I am paying for ISDN now. Cable modems are<br>
another possibility although I have heard both good and bad things about them<br>
(would *you* let a cable installer take the cover off your computer?). Actually<br>
the best cable modems have ethernet interfaces so this shouldn't be necessary.<br>
<p>
Frame relay is also a possibility if you have an ISP in your LATA who supports<br>
it. For a full-time connection it can be cheaper than ISDN depending on where<br>
you live. There are also devices which allow you to use several modem lines<br>
in combination to achieve higher speeds. At first this seems a bad idea but if<br>
your ISDN service is time-tarriffed and voice lines are not it might be worth<br>
looking into.<br>
<p>
In short, be sure to explore all your options and try and find out not only<br>
what's available now but what will be in the near future. Remember that ISDN is<br>
20-year-old technology and is relatively expensive.<br>
<p>
Sorry to get a bit off-topic here but there does seem to be some interest.<br>
