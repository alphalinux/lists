 ** "Compaq Pledges Volume Sales for Alpha," **<br>
     June 12, "EE Times" <br>
<p>
 In the June 12 issue of "Electronic Times," Eckhard Pfeiffer made a<br>
 surprisingly strong statement of support for the Alpha microprocessor<br>
 and Digital's Unix operating system as part of a new corporate focus<br>
 on 64-bit computing. <br>
<p>
 "Compaq will support leadership in 64-bit computing by moving Alpha <br>
 and Digital Unix into volume platforms," Pfeiffer said in New York<br>
 today [June 12, 1998].<br>

 ** "Pfeiffer: Alpha, Digital Unix to Give Compaq Strategic<br>
     Advantage," **  "PC Week," June 12<br>
<p>
 In the June 12 issue of "PC Week," Eckhard Pfeiffer discusses how<br>
 Compaq will take full advvantage of the technological superiority<br>
 of DIGITAL UNIX on Alpha.<br>
<p>
 "There is no good in acquiring something and then shutting it down,"<br>
 Pfeiffer said, adding that he is spending a lot of his time with some<br>
 of Digital's largest customers, allaying fears that the company will<br>
 terminate development of Digital technologies."<br>

 In the June 22 issue of "InternetWeek," Eckhard Pfeiffer discusses<br>
 positioning of UNIX and NT.<br>
<p>
 The article begins:<br>
<p>
 "In its first major strategy discussion since acquiring Digital<br>
 Equipment, Compaq last week outlined a one-two punch for integrating<br>
 Digital products."<br>
<p>
 "In a nutshell: Intel/Windows NT systems will be on the low end,<br>
 Alpha/Unix systems will be on the high end and a mix of both<br>
 technologies will serve the midrange."<br>

 The July 20 issue of "InformationWeek," looks at how Windows NT<br>
 systems carry lower sticker prices than their Unix counterparts,<br>
 but ongoing maintenance and support requirements can make them much<br>
 more costly to run.<br>

 Digital Unix rocks (I still love Linux)<br>
 Posted by: tlewis<br>
 Date posted: Mon Jun 15  8:10:33 PDT 1998<br>
<p>
 Digital Unix, or the operating system formerly known as OSF/1,<br>
 completely rocks.<br>
<p>
 For servers, I would not use anything else. Altavista, amazon.com,<br>
 and my employer, MindSpring, all use it exclusively.<br>
<p>
 On the BIND-developers mailing list, there was a funny episode a<br>
 few weeks ago where all of a sudden, everyone running one of the<br>
 root name servers confessed that they were running them on Digital<br>
 Unix. "You are?  Hey, me too; what a coincidence!"<br>
<p>
 DU has the following nice properties:<br>
 - responds very well under load; it has a very good scheduler.<br>
   This is a critical property in a server OS.<br>
 - Excellent programming environment.  They are religiously<br>
   standards-compliant, and their docs are very good.  Also, DEC<br>
   supplies an excellent JDK for the Alpha.<br>
 - fast as greased lightening.  Running on the Alpha helps here, but<br>
   still, it's really fast.<br>
 - 64-bit OS.  We're coming close to having machines in the 32-bit<br>
   space of memory requirements, and having a 64-bit platform is nice.<br>
   (Of course, Linux is fully 64-bit-capable, too.)<br>
<p>
 Linux has little to fear from DU; it's not geared as a desktop OS,<br>
 and the  $500 price-tag is guaranteed to keep people coming to<br>
 redhat and debian for their desktop needs for a while to come.<br>
 However, for heavy-duty servers, DU is the way to go.  Hell, the<br>
 Alpha machines are damned cheap for servers regardless of their<br>
 excellent performance; all in all, it just makes a great package.<br>
