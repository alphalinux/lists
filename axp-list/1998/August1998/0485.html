<p>
<p>
For all of you to whom this way of assignment of scsi "tags" can be a<br>
problem - for a very long time on tsx-11.mit.edu there is available<br>
'scsidev' utility which solves this in a user space.  Yes, it does<br>
compile on Alpha and it works too.  There are also some enhancements<br>
avaiable - although I cannot now to tell where.<br>
<p>
The whole underlying infrastructure required for mounting file systems<br>
by their unique id's is also present in Linux.  So far nobody bothered<br>
to provide user tools to make that useful.<br>
<p>
For the current developmnent kernels there is a proposed 'devfs' patch<br>
which provides "Solaris like" scheme.  Frankly, the more I look<br>
at it the less I like it.  It has at least three very serious problems:<br>
  - it is relatively "heavy weight", i.e. it intervenes quite<br>
    substantially into existing kernel structures<br>
  - it puts way too much policy decisions into kernel (which implies,<br>
    among other things, that if something will go wrong you will have a<br>
    tough time untangling resulting mess as witnessed by all those who<br>
    had a displeasure of having an "accident" on Solaris after which<br>
    you may spent long hours trying to figure out which device happens<br>
    to be your keyboard)<br>
  - it lacks an information persistence (so what were ownership and<br>
    permissions on this device?) and proposed workarounds are<br>
    hair-raising hacks;  hypothetical better solutions make 90% of<br>
    devfs superflous.<br>
<p>
Problems of device identification will hit with force when USB will<br>
start to show up in reality.  We will see solutions as well ('scsidev'<br>
is limited only to SCSI) but I hope for something better than devfs<br>
although devfs experience surely will not be wasted.<br>
