While we are on this topic, I have to say that Adaptec has been *very* <br>
cooperative with us.  They had me out there a few weeks ago to talk <br>
about what they needed to do to be "Linux friendly".  The people I've <br>
been working with are 100% in favor of open source and open specs.  They <br>
have sent Doug Ledford (AIC7xxx driver author) all their specs and <br>
requested that he ensure that all code derived from those specs be open <br>
source and funneled into the mainstream Linux kernel.<br>
<p>
They have also over-flowed my test lab with every card they have ever <br>
made.  I never thought I would be flooded by Adaptec. :)  They are <br>
also working with us to open up the source code on some tools they use <br>
internally for driver testing.  I've been very pleased with the effort <br>
I've seen from Adaptec.<br>
