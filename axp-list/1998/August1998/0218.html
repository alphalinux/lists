<i>&gt; &gt; It depends on how the system works. A SHM segment takes up</i><br>

<i>&gt; Well, that doesn't really have anything to do with the current problem.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Unless you're saying that 256MB segments are the drawback.  If you're</i><br>
<i>&gt; talking about the 16 slots, then making the segment size too small would</i><br>

<i>&gt; address space, I'm sure there has to be a better medium than 16 slots of</i><br>
<i>&gt; 256MB or 1024 slots of just under 4 MB.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
The key is there are only so many slots. How much VM you<br>
attach is up to you. Richard's answer explains the real<br>
issue on Alpha. Not being pagable and being able to make<br>
a big SHM segment would cause major problems.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; use for other memory so if you use several SHM segments, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; can decrease your available memory within the process significantly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Anyone know if Alpha's do something similar??</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How often is shared memory really needed?  This strikes me as being</i><br>
<i>&gt; something needed primarily for pre-threaded apps.  I'm not saying it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; useless, but I think that there is little demand for it in general and</i><br>
<i>&gt; that demand is not increasing.  I think it's a relatively low-demand type</i><br>
<i>&gt; of thing.  UNIXen are primarily dealing with pipes, not shm...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
SHM segments are very useful on an SMP where you want<br>
to do parallel processing. It's faster than a pipe <br>
because a pipe copies to kernel land and back and<br>
SHM is directly in your memory space so there's<br>
only one copy to it and the next process can get it.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Actually, couldn't you make a small mod to cdrecord to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; do some minor searching to figure out how much SHM it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; can get?? Then, if it didn't get the optimal amount, issue</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a warning and proceed with the less optimal amount.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A simple start at 4MB and decrement by 4KB until it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; works would be sufficient...</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; That way, there is less user intervention until one</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; creates a coaster...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, it'll all be handled over the web so the actual parameters are going</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be hard coded anyway.  It's no biggie, but I would think that it would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be a bigger general problem.  X uses shared memory, as does the GIMP</i><br>
<i>&gt; (though I don't know how the two use it in concert if at all).  What this</i><br>
<i>&gt; is used for I don't know, but I would gladly give up 512 or 768 shared</i><br>
<i>&gt; memory segments in leiu of a larger maximum shared memory pool.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; At $.99 a blank CD now, it's not too painful to screw</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; up but I've never had a buffer underrun with cdrecord.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's not so easy to happen unintentionally often.  I was writing at 4x</i><br>
<i>&gt; while flipping back and forth in windowmaker and loading the GIMP trying</i><br>
<i>&gt; to make it swap as much as possible without renice'ing the cdrecord</i><br>
<i>&gt; processes.  There were 29 underruns in total out of 22,000+ sectors</i><br>
<i>&gt; (336,000+ blocks).  Under normal load this should be rare.  This was also</i><br>
<i>&gt; a 2MB buffer, not the 3MB I've set it at now.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Your machine actually swaps while running??<br>
That's bad news. I'd try to make sure that for the<br>
workload I put on the machine, it has sufficient<br>
real memory and pretty much never swap. Memory<br>
is so cheap now.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; From what I remember, the default Solaris 2.5 SHM max</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is only 1MB so 4MB isn't that bad.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I find that difficult to believe.  It's probably 4MB.  =)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Humm... I just ran a test with 1MB + 2 bytes and it<br>
fails with "Unable to create shm segment (Invalid argument)".<br>
There is supposed to be a way to set it but I can't<br>
find it in my book at the moment.<br>
