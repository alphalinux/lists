<EM>&gt; &gt; I've always been puzzled by this subject. I can remember in ancient times when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I started building a few single board computers from bare boards. The guys who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; were really intense at the time (mostly SS-50 bus believers) swore by all gold
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sockets as a way to avoid bad connections. This was the mil spec at the time. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; was always suspicious that only after the computer explosion and chips were in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; short supply did the vendors warn everybody about the dangers of using gold
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; connectors with tin chips instead of the tin sockets they happened to have in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; stock. I personally don't put much stock in the dissimilar metal theory, since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the whole reason for using the gold was that it is electrochemically inert (at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; least thats what I learned in my graduate electrochemistry course).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I've used gold plated ram in tin sockets with no troubles.  It would be the tin that
<BR>
would have the corrosion but I suspect it would be very slow.  Might be worse in
<BR>
humid surroundings but most computers are in ac these days. I have seen it on the
<BR>
power connectors more often, tho.  As a matter of fact, one MircoVax Box (BA23) had a
<BR>
power connector that would corrode ever so slightly but the corrosion would cause RF
<BR>
interference that would show up as memory errors or bus errors and would affect the
<BR>
tape drive.  Replaceing that power connector would solve the problem.  The old ones
<BR>
had a tendency to over heat also, due to the corrosion.  That was under a heavy load
<BR>
tho.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As I understand it, galvanic corrosion between two metals when one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; metal is more noble that the other.  The noble metal may not suffer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corrosion, but the less noble metal will waste away.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am employed in the marine industry, and galvanic corrosion is a real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem.  One has to be careful to design systems to avoid galvanic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corrosion when exposed to seawater (an excellent electrolyte).  One
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wants to use components that are similar in nobility, or else corrosion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will occur on the less noble surface.  Sometimes this is employed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advantage, for instance, the use of zinc anodes on a steel hull to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prevent corrosion of the steel in seawater.  Since zinc is less noble
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than steel, the anodes waste away instead of the hull.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you've hit on the solution.  Let's just attach a hunk of zink to the case and
<BR>
put it in salt water.
