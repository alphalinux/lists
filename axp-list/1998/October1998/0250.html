<P>
I just looked inside one of my AS200's, and it looked like the PCI/ISA slots
<BR>
were gold plated, but it wasn't real obvious that the SIMM sockets were gold. I
<BR>
couldn't see the SIMM's themselves.
<BR>
<P>I've always been puzzled by this subject. I can remember in ancient times when
<BR>
I started building a few single board computers from bare boards. The guys who
<BR>
were really intense at the time (mostly SS-50 bus believers) swore by all gold
<BR>
sockets as a way to avoid bad connections. This was the mil spec at the time. I
<BR>
was always suspicious that only after the computer explosion and chips were in
<BR>
short supply did the vendors warn everybody about the dangers of using gold
<BR>
connectors with tin chips instead of the tin sockets they happened to have in
<BR>
stock. I personally don't put much stock in the dissimilar metal theory, since
<BR>
the whole reason for using the gold was that it is electrochemically inert (at
<BR>
least thats what I learned in my graduate electrochemistry course).

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         With the recent discussion about gold vs. tin SIMM and socket
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plating, my curiousity is raised about the AlphaStation 200.  Does anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know if the SIMM sockets in it are tin or gold?  Also, I would assume that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the memory which was shipped with it (16M installed and 16M upgrade kit)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be of the same plating type, but.....?  I have one, but I do not have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; physical access to it at the moment.
