<P>
The 21066 Alpha chip had a number of nice features, but speed was not chief
<BR>
among them.  The on chip local bus between the PCI, Memory and CPU core
<BR>
chokes up at about 30MB/Sec and for the general case (its a mostly integer
<BR>
world) you should expect to see performance comparable to a 90MHz Pentium.

<EM>&gt; I got my Multia running with redhat 5.2, and starting compling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; various utilities, like ssh.  It took *forever*.  I have an old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; P100 that's faster, by quite a lot.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Any thoughts?  How does a i586/100 beat a axp/166?

<P>Here, here...  I read the other followup, and he's right, just because the
<BR>
clock speed is faster doesn't mean necessarily overall throughput of same
<BR>
tasks will be faster.  I think someone suggested a 2:1 ratio for RISC:CISC
<BR>
clock rates generating &quot;equal&quot; (loosely used, of course) machines.
<BR>
<P>My UDB/166 with RH5.1 and 64M takes about 45-60 minutes to build the 2.0.35
<BR>
kernel with only the things I need compiled into the kernel and only the
<BR>
devices the UDB has built as modules (SCSI, ethernet, etc.)  I've been
<BR>
trying
<BR>
to compile KDE on this box for the last four days, and I'm still not done.
<BR>
:)
<BR>
(It's not really taking that long, but it builds a piece of it every 
<BR>
night--I spend about 2-4 hours a night working on it, and this is as far
<BR>
as I've got.)
<BR>
<P>But the Multia is faster than the 486-100 it replaced as a fileserver for 
<BR>
a bunch of old 2G Fast-Narrow SCSI devices, a 4x CDROM, a 2G 4mm DAT, and
<BR>
my ZIP drive.  Imagine this:  I (for the first time in my nerdly life)
<BR>
have a SCSI bus with something at every ID--and it's all external!
<BR>
<P>The Multia is great for low-volume file-server needs here at home.  As soon
<BR>
as I get a window-manager configuration that doesn't suck and can run under
<BR>
8bpp, I may even use it as an X-terminal.
