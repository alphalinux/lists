Hey Bob,
<BR>
<P>Uh... sorry to bug you, but where did you get the source for ipfwadm for 
<BR>
Alpha? I got the one from the www.xos.nl site.... but....
<BR>
<P>I'm having a lot of compile problems... a lot of warnings about 
<BR>
redefinitions, conflicting types and incomplete types... I found out all 
<BR>
the header files in /usr/include/netinet/ are different than the ones 
<BR>
that are in the kernel source tree. I think the one's in the netinet are 
<BR>
wrong... or do they serve some special purpose? I looked at the ip_fw.h 
<BR>
in the kernel source tree.. and it looks right... unsigned short, 
<BR>
unsigned long instead of the u_int16_t and u_int32_t....
<BR>
<P>Man... these files all really screwed up.... unless there is something I 
<BR>
completely missed here.... what am I not understanding?
<BR>
<P>I'm on Redhat 5.2/Alpha by the way.... if I am right, and a lot of these 
<BR>
headers are wrong, can Redhat please release an update with the correct 
<BR>
ones so we don't have to manually fix all of them? Or can someone 
<BR>
explain to me what my problem is?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; By the way, to bob who replied below... how did you figure out what 
</EM><BR>
was
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; wrong with the code? Or did you read all of the code and stumbled on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; that problem?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I used RH5.1 on an Intel machine and did masquerading.  But, after that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;machine died, I decided to get an Alpha.  I spent several days fiddling 
</EM><BR>
with
<BR>
<EM>&gt;ipfwadm trying to get it to work, saying to myself, &quot;I *know* this 
</EM><BR>
should
<BR>
<EM>&gt;work, but it isn't....&quot; :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I decided to search the web to see if anyone else had problems like 
</EM><BR>
this.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;The only article I found was dated in August of this year (sorry, I 
</EM><BR>
forgot
<BR>
<EM>&gt;the author's name and where it was located).  The author had said that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it appeared as if the ip_fw structure was not correct and was dependant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;upon a 32-bit architecture.  I just changed the 2 32-bit declarations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so they would be correct on a 64-bit architecture.  I recompiled the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;kernel and ipfwadm, and that did the trick.
