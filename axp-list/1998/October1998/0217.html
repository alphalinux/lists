In response to the welcome remarks of Chris Albertson at 05:42 PM 11/16/98 -0800:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;My Multia has gold sockets also.  Just try however to find gold 72pin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;parity RAM.  If you do please let us all know where you fond it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In my experiance tin SIMMS in gold sockets is not that bad.  It you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;run into problems take the RAM out and re-seat it.  I'd prefer gold
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;too.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;About a month ago, I looked for memory for my first Multia.  I found at least 2 suppliers of 72 pin, 8 meg x 36 parity, gold lead simms.  The ones I bought were made by Viking.  I bought them from a supplier who said he was just down the street from Viking.  Using tin simms in gold sockets will usually work for a while.  The looser fit of the gold sockets may mean occasional reseating like you say.  The galvanic corrosion can take a while, depending on your climate.  I want a system that will run for the next 10 years, computing a single math problem, so long term reliability is important to me.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't have the information here on the name of the company I bought from.  I will look for it and post it in a couple of days, if you wish.  I found them by going to pricewatch.com and searching for prices on true parity simms.  I remember that they were one of the more expensive choices, but they were the only ones who knew what I was talking about.  The other supplier that I think handles these simms is Crucial Technologies, who are owned by Micron.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Does your memory work in the Multia at all?  Is it two 32s or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;four 16s?  What did you have to pay?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The tin simms went with an extra Multia I got last week.  They sent me the wrong model Multia, and I have not plugged the memory in.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;You need genuine ECC SIMMs. 9 chips, often sold as &quot;parity&quot; RAM.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;parity&quot; is normally cheaper than ECC RAM so I doubt much ECC RAM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is sold as parity ram.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I was referring to true parity simms.  With 2 36 bit wide simms, the chipset can generate hamming codes to do error correction.  For most PC chipsets, sufficiently fast true parity simms are all you need for error correction.
