<P>
3 AA Alkaline cells in a rewired 4-cell holder work fine for me.
<BR>
My 3 Multias arrived with measurably bad (2V) batteries.
<BR>
4.5V sounds as though CPUmicromart finally did start putting in new ones.
<BR>
They said they were going to do that.  A 4-cell holder will fit in the
<BR>
case, if you patiently tuck it in.
<BR>
<P>To eliminate the battery as a problem, just disconnect it.  The system
<BR>
will work fine that way, just not holding the startup settings defined in
<BR>
the ARC console.
<BR>
<P>My Multia's didn't work right off, even after disconnecting the battery.
<BR>
Maybe they need to be discharged overnight.  I don't remember if I tried
<BR>
shorting the battery terminals.
<BR>
<P>It is pretty simple, BTW, to build a kernel with sound support.  The
<BR>
builtin sound system works fine.    You need to set the mixer levels at
<BR>
startup for some reason.  There's noise that comes from one of (probably
<BR>
unterminated) line inputs.
