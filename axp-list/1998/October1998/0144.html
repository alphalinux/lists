<P>
I just got one of those $99 DEC Multias.  What a nice looking
<BR>
and well built little box.  I have quite a bit of experience
<BR>
with Sun and with Linux/i386 but none at all with the Alpha.
<BR>
Now to get it working....
<BR>
<P>I ran into a few problems.
<BR>
<P>1) Memory.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I bought four 8MB 72pin 36-bit SIMMs.  These have 24 identical
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;chips on each SIMM (12 on a side) and have a &quot;-6&quot; on the part
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;number which I assume means 60ns.  I load this in, attach a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;CRT and keyboard, press the power button and, nothing happens.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Zero.  The CRT does not even see a live video signal and goes into
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;power save mode.  I tried using half the memory at a time in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;various combinations.  No luck.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Next I round up some 30 pin SIMMS and a pair of 30 -&gt; 72 pin
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;converters.  I put this in and now I see something on the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;monitor.  It is all green with a white block cursor on the lower
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;left.  But that's it.  The machine is totally unresponsive.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting doe not seem to help after 30 minutes it is the same.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have expected at least some beeps or some kind of error
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;message to be printed to the screen.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is something other then generic 36-bit RAM required? 
<BR>
<P>2) The machine came with a 4.5V clock battery.  Does anyone know
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;how to check it.  It measures 4.5V under no load condition but
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I know this is a poor way o test.  Or should I assume the little
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cube shaped thing is dead and replace it.  I assume a could use
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;three AA batteries in series.  Any problem with this idea? 
<BR>
