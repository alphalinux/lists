Hallo !
<BR>
While not beeing new to linux (using it on an intel box quite a while) I
<BR>
just got an LX-System (128 MB RAM, german keyboard, Logitech PS/2-mouse)
<BR>
with RedHat preinstalled. Since this is my first RedHat system (and I do
<BR>
have only a CD with the alpha 5.1-stuff, no handbook) I tried to look at
<BR>
RedHats Webpages, through the HOWTOs etc. So maybe I just skiped
<BR>
the right (f) manual and would be glad to read it.
<BR>
<P>My first problem is my keyboard. On the console the Del and Ins. keys just
<BR>
produce an beep and an ~. If I start emacs (on the console) they work. I
<BR>
selected different keyboard-layouts with kbdselect, that changed e.g. the
<BR>
umlaute (where do I active them for bash ? zsh does recognize them
<BR>
without problem) but it did not change the Del/Ins behaviour. dumpkeys -l
<BR>
shows me, that the BackSpace key is mapped on Delete (but works fine)
<BR>
while the the Delete-Key is mapped onto Remove. When starting X xenv and
<BR>
xkeyboard both tell me, that everything is fine with those keys but in
<BR>
xterms they still do not work. In emacs under X I am able to map both keys
<BR>
onto the same behaviour (either backspace or delete) while in gimp and
<BR>
xfig both keys do their job. Before I start digging deep into config files
<BR>
(I admit, I am used to programs like SuSEs Yast) I thought there must be
<BR>
an easy way for a straight RedHat install. Thanks.
<BR>
<P>The second problem is related to the mouse and gpm. I replaced the Mach64
<BR>
X server with the one from mea.tmt.tele.fi (as recently posted) and now I
<BR>
am able to open 110+ windows. But when switching from X to the console and
<BR>
moving the mouse at the same time X crashes, telling me about contact lost
<BR>
to the mouse (sorry, forgot to write down exact phrasing). This is
<BR>
reproducible. This happens also with everything as RedHat installs them
<BR>
(removed my config files). Maybe related the shutdown sequence locked
<BR>
already twice when gpm was to be shut down. I was able to switch consoles
<BR>
but had to power cycle using the button on the box (Arg :-().
<BR>
<P>Thanks in advance from an alpha/RedHat-Linux newbie.
<BR>
