</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this generates the same result as the original program but will not &gt;cause a trap.
</EM><BR>
<P>This starts to look confusing........
<BR>
<P>However, I studied the Alpha Architecture Handbook again and - hopefully
<BR>
- begin to understand what is happening und a way to find the real cause
<BR>
of this and a way out
<BR>
<P>We have to distinguish 2 cases here:
<BR>
<P>1) Denormals as OPERANDS to a fp op
<BR>
<P>2) Denormals as RESULT of an fp op
<BR>
<P>to 1)
<BR>
<P>The Alpha hardware definitely cannot handle denormals as input to fp
<BR>
ops. This has to be fixed in software, by the trap handler AND for this
<BR>
to REALLY work in REAL code, due to the (damned !!) imprecise trap
<BR>
handling will require extensive use of trapb instructions, that
<BR>
basically serialize the fpu and make a scalar machine out of a pipelined
<BR>
one, basically what -mieee does, it slows down the code a lot.
<BR>
Basically, the idea of the dec engineers was that in critical code you
<BR>
might be able to identify the few ops that are really critical and put a
<BR>
trapb only here, but it seems that neither gcc/egcs or even the DEC cc
<BR>
is smart enough to do this efiiciently, instead, you have to clutter
<BR>
your code with those instructions.
<BR>
<P>to 2)
<BR>
<P>Here the DEC documentation is a bit misleading, it seems I was wrong !
<BR>
The fp ops have an additional qualifier /U that determines the underflow
<BR>
behavior. HOWEVER, at a first look (what I had done till now,, it seems,
<BR>
sorry), you only have two possibilities
<BR>
<P>- either you do not use /U, then the documentation says any fp op will
<BR>
trap with all the above problems when a denormal is a result of the op
<BR>
<P>- or you use /U, then no trap will happen, but also, the denormal will
<BR>
not be replaced by a true zero and the code will trap via 1) the next
<BR>
time the result is used in further calculations.
<BR>
<P>HOWEVER, reading on reveals a bit more, 1st, there is an additional
<BR>
underflow trap disable bit in the fp control register, and 2nd, when the
<BR>
trap happens, the setting by zero that I missed, will already happen by
<BR>
the hardware !!! Huh, why not with /U but instead vice-versa ???
<BR>
<P>This seems, that the way to go would be &quot;enable&quot; the underflow trap
<BR>
(with replacing by zero) by NOT using /u (as is usually already done),
<BR>
but later again DISABLE that very same trap in the fp control register.
<BR>
Yet, and it seems, LINUX AXP is already configured to do just this !!
<BR>
<P>This would explain the two codes :
<BR>
<P>In the code with 1e-310, which already IS a denormal 1) applies and you
<BR>
get a trap and as long you did not compile the stuff with trapb
<BR>
instructions, even a probably better trap handler could not fix it.
<BR>
BTW, the very same should happen also on DEC Unix, when reading 1e-310
<BR>
from a binary file or if you code it as a hex number (Somebody could try
<BR>
that ?). DEC CC seems to try to avoid such by never allowing you to
<BR>
input such numbers in a regular way, what explains the warning in the
<BR>
DEC output and that it did not print 1e-310 as last result.
<BR>
<P>In the code with 1e-155**2 instead, all things seems to go as they
<BR>
should, 2) applies.
<BR>
<P>BUT, so why do still many people see so many problems with denormals
<BR>
under AXP Linux ?? When you never input a denormal and all fp op never
<BR>
return a denormal, NO problems should happen !!
<BR>
<P>I have the impression that might be the function routines that are not
<BR>
written to NOT return denormals, for example exp of a large negative
<BR>
number could return a denormal. This should be changed.
<BR>
<P>Incidentially - &lt;Advertisement on&gt; the new version of libffm 0.28 is out
<BR>
that now fully handles illegal arguments and results. It should never
<BR>
return a denormal (ONLY in the linear regions for small args of sin,
<BR>
tan, asin, atan, where the arg is simply returned as is, but then you
<BR>
already HAD the problem earlier on) and anybody with the above problems
<BR>
should give it a try if it fixes the probs. As is does not yet contain
<BR>
ALL libm functions, it still could happen, in such case could somebody
<BR>
try to trace which function would be missing to be fixed/replaced first.
<BR>
<P>Actually, I HAD been wondering when designing libffm, if exp needs to
<BR>
return a denormal for very small arguments, and now I see, it was a good
<BR>
decision (to be lazy and) not to add that !! &lt;Advertisement OFF&gt;
<BR>
<P>Hope this turns out to be right and helps !!
<BR>
<P>If you still find a code that does not seem to fit to the above
<BR>
explanation, please send it to me.
