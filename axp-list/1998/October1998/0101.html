Hello,
<BR>
<P>I was able to solve the problem... by doing 3 things... I don't really 
<BR>
know which one did the job.... but it worked.
<BR>
<P>First, I noticed that the SCSI ID was the same on both channels... so I 
<BR>
went into the BIOS and set CH-A ID =7 and CH-B ID =6.... also, I turned 
<BR>
on the SCSI BIOS... it was disabled by default. And lastly, I didn't 
<BR>
have any devices on CH-B.. and was suspicious that perhaps termination 
<BR>
wasn't happening correctly.. so I changed host termination on CH-B to 
<BR>
Enable from Automatic.
<BR>
<P>Anyways,... after this, everything seems to work... except reboot. I 
<BR>
have my system automatically boot into RH 5.2/Alpha with no problems on 
<BR>
a cold boot (well, when it mounts the root disk, it does take a while... 
<BR>
I don't know why, but much slower than my Intel Linux boxes).
<BR>
The problem is when I shutdown and go back to MILO... if I try to boot 
<BR>
from there... it gives me all sorts of errors... like sound not 
<BR>
initializing, no floppy controller, sometimes the SCSI bus doesn't reset 
<BR>
properly and hangs..... but if I reset the machine (by reset switch) ... 
<BR>
it's back and up with no problems at all. 
<BR>
<P>Software wise, rxvt seems to crash a lot.... and asload (in AfterStep) 
<BR>
crashes with some sort of division by zero? But software problems are 
<BR>
fixable..... so I'm not too worried. 
<BR>
<P>Well,... I hope this will help other people that had my problems... I 
<BR>
will probably write a step-by-step instruction doc for the procedure and 
<BR>
submit it to the alphalinux.org site.... as it took a lot of info 
<BR>
gathering for me to figure out how to get RH 5.2 going on Alpha... my 
<BR>
first Alpha!

<EM>&gt;&gt;Hello,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;I am having trouble installing RH5.2 on a Digital PWS 500a (miata). It 
</EM><BR>
has a
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Adaptec 3940UW controller which seems to be causing trouble.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;The system has the latest AlphaBIOS for it, and I've managed to get 
</EM><BR>
MILO
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;loaded after getting the new miata milo from ftp.digital.com . 
</EM><BR>
However,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;booting the miata boot image from RH5.2 causes a hang with channel B 
</EM><BR>
of the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Adaptec 3940UW controller. I believe it is resetting the channel.. and 
</EM><BR>
then
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;hangs.... channel A is okay.... could this be a side effect of me not 
</EM><BR>
having
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;any devices on channel B?? I have a UW Cheetah and Toshiba CDROM on 
</EM><BR>
channel
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;A. Nothing on channel B?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;I tried using a raw kernel from ftp.digital.com.... and it seems to 
</EM><BR>
get pass
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;the channel B hanging problem..... at first..... but then crashes with 
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&quot;unable to handle kernel paging...&quot; error (or something like that). 
</EM><BR>
It's
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;been a while since I last had to pass critical parameters to the 
</EM><BR>
kernel...
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;so this could be my fault..... can someone advise? I believe i was 
</EM><BR>
doing:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;MILO&gt; boot fd0:vmlinux.gz noinitrd load_ramdisk=1 prompt_ramdisk=1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;mem=&quot;256M&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Or, is there a way around the 3940UW problem? Are there any variables 
</EM><BR>
I can
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;set in MILO to assist the bootup process so it doesn't hang?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Thanks in advance for any help. I'd appreciate it if you email your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;responses to my email.. or at least cc:. Thanks!!!

<EM>&gt;Hi -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm not sure what it is but I have scsi timeout problems on my Adaptec 
</EM><BR>
2940UW
<BR>
<EM>&gt;controller.  Curiously 5.2 is severely affected but 5.1 seems to 
</EM><BR>
install okay.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;????
