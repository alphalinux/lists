<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; This looks like libI77 was not itself compiled with -mieee. Don't the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; egcs build scripts default to building libI77 with -mieee?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Would make sense to have the libraries built both ways.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; That way people who don't want to fix the bugs in their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; code can pay the penalty for using -mieee and those willing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to get their code working correctly get the best performance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; available by using a non -mieee version of the library.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You're assuming that -mieee makes a big difference in library
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; run-time. I suspect it doesn't, since it doesn't have that many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; floating point ops in it, and when it does, it does expensive things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyway, like converting to ascii and back.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>As I said, those that want it should have their own
<BR>
version. Those that don't should not get it in their
<BR>
code path.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I also don't see why you think that only bugs generate NaN's. But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that's a different issue.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Ask yourself how many customers would pay you to
<BR>
produce a NaN for them....
<BR>
<P>The key is to create algorithms that do not
<BR>
create NaN's in the range of values you expect
<BR>
to have data in.
<BR>
<P>I get paid to get a good result, not nonsense.
<BR>
<P>Research and academic code may consider it valid
<BR>
but I've never had a customer who would accept such
<BR>
output.
