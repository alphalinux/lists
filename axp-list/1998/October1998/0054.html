<EM>&gt; &gt; I sincerely hope that is not the problem; it is very clearly defined in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; C programming language that logical AND and OR operations proceed from left

<EM>&gt; &gt; to right.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is, of course possible that the pointer wd has a non-zero value, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; points to memory not owned by the process...that would still cause a seg
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fault, and would have been evaluated properly...
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, as part of the AbiWord team, I can assure you that we're doing many
<BR>
such assignment tests in the code (not good news, huh? :).  In fact, the new 
<BR>
toolbar framework is similar to the implementation of the menu layout framework.  
<BR>
In short, this looks like a compiler issue on the Alpha, but without access to an
<BR>
Alpha (which I may have shortly if I buy one) it's hard to tell.  It's
<BR>
a very legal C++ test; I'm using EGCS 1.1b with -Wall and often -pedantic
<BR>
to keep out &quot;that which is not ANSI,&quot; but on an Intel, which is all we
<BR>
have available now.  
<BR>
<P>You know, this may be completely off here, but I'm wondering if the &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;
<BR>
is somehow not correct in ANDing the result of (wd-&gt;m_id == id) on a
<BR>
platform where the size of &quot;wd&quot; (pointer) is not the same size as 
<BR>
&quot;(wd-&gt;m_id == id)&quot; (bool same as int which is != size of pointer?).  Wild
<BR>
guess here.  :)  I would assume this possibility is very remote 
<BR>
since the evaluation is essentially &quot;if(wd){if(wd-&gt;m_id==id) {} }&quot;, but
<BR>
I haven't looked at the compiler source; it may be optimizing something
<BR>
funny.
