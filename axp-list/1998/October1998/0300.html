<EM>&gt;Hello all,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I have been having problems with my AHA2940UW card a lot, it caused a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;production server to crash last night, and I am wondering if anyone has any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;imput.  I have a very current version of the AIC7xxx driver, yet I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;still been having problems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>This is probably completely unrelated, but the Adaptec 2940UW version for
<BR>
the Macintosh has severe problems with the new G3 processors.  This has
<BR>
been covered extensively in the Mac press recently.
<BR>
<P>The cause is rather interesting; the G3 is very aggressive in doing
<BR>
speculative execution (tracing down both paths of a possible branch before
<BR>
it's even COMMITTED to reaching the branch).  In the course of doing this
<BR>
it may read I/O locations, and in strobing such memory addresses, confuse
<BR>
the peripheral card.  Apparently Adaptec cards HAVE this problem.
<BR>
<P>Now, the official Mac G3's have code in their ROM (except it isn't ROM
<BR>
anymore ;-) to set a &quot;guard bit&quot; to prevent this.  It seems to me that also
<BR>
tosses away some of the functionality of the chipset, but hey, better than
<BR>
having your hard-disk trashed.  The machines which have been UPGRADED to
<BR>
G3's, but still have the 604 ROMs, are the problem.  (I have one.)
<BR>
<P>So perhaps part of the problem the Adaptec cards have with other
<BR>
processors--I've read complaints about both Intel and Alpha platforms--has
<BR>
to do with speculative execution setting off one of the card's firmware
<BR>
bugs.
<BR>
<P>We haven't had trouble with our Alpha.  But that's because we use another
<BR>
UW controller ;-)  Now if I could just figure out how to get the DAMNED
<BR>
FLOATING POINT to compile and not dump core...
<BR>
