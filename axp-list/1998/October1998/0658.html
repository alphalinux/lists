</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Tonight I had a horrible machine crash during a local disk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; backup using rsync.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The fact that the system crashed while rsync was running (&amp; presumably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; writing substantial system changes) would account for the massive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; filesystem corruption.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The fact that the system crashed at all is probably a kernel bug or a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hardware problem.  There are things which can crash the system (such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as using up all of memory) which maybe should be considered a lack of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; robustness and not a kernel bug.  But in your case, if rsync had a bug
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &amp; ran amok, sucking up all of memory, then this probably would have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pushed the disk cache onto the disk, thus minimizing file system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corruption.  On the other hand, if rsync was running as root (which I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assume you were probably doing), it could have started writing all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; over the disk, causing the crash.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, I'd give you a definite maybe on the rsync bug... :).
</EM><BR>
<P>The answer from the rsync author is that it is probably a kernel
<BR>
bug.  I am not sure I will pursue this, as it happens on a
<BR>
production machine and our support starts getting calls
<BR>
a few milliseconds after any stop.
<BR>
Now I will probably go back to good old rdist for a while
<BR>
and this should rule out h/w problems (which I do not think
<BR>
to have).

contains the whole exchange with the rsync people.
<BR>
<P>Yes, rsync was running as root, updating 62000+ files in 1.6GB.
<BR>
System is LX533, 256MB RAM, 512MB swap, lightly loaded.
