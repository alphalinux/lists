<EM>&gt; &gt; That statement in itself

<EM>&gt; &gt; indicates there must be FP calculations in the library,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which in turn means -mieee is not &quot;free&quot;.

<EM>&gt; Sorry, I thought you were reading the thread. The original bug report
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; included a gdb session which makes it clear that the library was doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an fp operation (d &lt; 0.0). I then speculated on the relative number of fp
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operations in the library, and predicted that no one would lose if we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; made -mieee the default for the library.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>If you have time, try determine roughly how much
<BR>
FP work is done in the libraries. Based on that
<BR>
estimate, it may make sense to make -mieee a default
<BR>
but since it's not that way now, it always helps
<BR>
to quantify as much as possible, what the change would
<BR>
do, particularly if it can potentially impact performance.
<BR>
g77 gets lots of heat due to performance issues so it
<BR>
seems prudent to not make changes that make performance
<BR>
worse without a strong argument. The question is
<BR>
&quot;how much worse?&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Be that as it may, the solution for DgncppB
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I was posting about a different issue: all codes that use -mieee need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a library which can print NaN's. If you want to talk about debugging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that one code, that's great -- what we need for that is an exact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prescription of how to get precise exceptions and core dumps in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; face of NaN and Infinity generation. But be aware that there is more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than one issue being talked about.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I was basing the discussion on the subject line.
<BR>
NaN handling is a reasonable goal. It just goes
<BR>
against high performance on Alphas, and, as such, should 
<BR>
not be in the main path of the code unless one explicitly
<BR>
selects that option, for a particular application.
