<P>
<EM>&gt;I have a similar system, but I've had no drive problems.  The only 
</EM><BR>
problem
<BR>
<EM>&gt;I have is getting the built-in tulip chip to work on 2.1.129. Maybe 
</EM><BR>
Loic's
<BR>
<EM>&gt;patches don't work on exp. kernels?
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm... actually, I had some problems like that too... but not exactly. 
<BR>
I got the tulip driver to work with the onboard Ethernet using version 
<BR>
0.89H (I think). My problem was that when I added a second ethernet 
<BR>
card(or third).. the onboard died. ifconfig reported all ethernets up 
<BR>
and go, but the link light was gone, and I couldn't get pass the 
<BR>
interface out to the network. At first I thought it was some problem 
<BR>
with the tulip driver and having two DC21x4x based ethernet 
<BR>
controllers.... I thought somehow it was getting confused... but that 
<BR>
wasn't the problem, since I tried mixing the onboard with some 3com 
<BR>
cards. I also tried a variety of combinations of compiling the drivers 
<BR>
as modules and into the kernel. None of this helped. I also read some 
<BR>
french dude's posting who was also having the same problems. (recall, 
<BR>
the problem ONLY exists for me with an add-on ethernet in combo with the 
<BR>
onboard) He basically gave up after several months... well, since May 
<BR>
98. From what he could tell, there was something odd hardware wise with 
<BR>
the onboard ethernet of the PWS a/au series. It's based on the DC21143 
<BR>
chip... other than that, I'm clueless.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;As for the keyboard locking out on you, I had to 'correct' the sound
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;configuration on 2.0.35.  Don't ask, I have no clue why....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What compiler?  egcs-1.1 and up seem to have a bit of trouble 
</EM><BR>
generating
<BR>
<EM>&gt;totally stable code.  They won't compile a certain module in 2.0.36, 
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt;the X SVGA server trashes the console, the only fix is a soft boot.
</EM><BR>
<P>I just installed RH5.2... and haven't played with it that much... just 
<BR>
trying to get some essentials going... so it's egcs 1.0.3a-14. I'm using 
<BR>
the 2.0.35 source that came with RH5.2. By the way, has anyone else 
<BR>
noticed that some of the header files in the kernel source are different 
<BR>
from the ones that get installed on the system? I keep getting 
<BR>
'redefinition' warnings during compile because of this.... the kernel 
<BR>
source has 'unsigned long' in place of 'u_int32_t' that are in the 
<BR>
identical files in the system include dir. However, I noticed that in 
<BR>
another header file, typedef is used to alias u_int32_t with 'unsigned 
<BR>
long'. So it seems like it should okay... but egcs is complaining... I'm 
<BR>
no professional programmer... just learning as I go.... but that seems a 
<BR>
bit odd... anyone care to explain please?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Some comments on what others wrote (some clipping):
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; I've had this problem since day one when I installed RH5.2... at 
</EM><BR>
first I 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; thought it might be a problem with my SCSI... but now that I'm not 
</EM><BR>
the 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; only one.... hmmm... anyways.. yes, it takes about 2 to 3 minutes 
</EM><BR>
just 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; to mount my root partition.... on a similar Intel system, it takes 
</EM><BR>
less 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; than 10 seconds.....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It would help to know if you've tried RH5.1, and make sure you are sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the SCSI system is connected and terminated correctly.  Do you have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;QLogic or Adaptec SCSI?  The Qlogic ones gave me trouble.  I heard they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are better, but at that time, Linux's support for it &amp; PWS wasn't good.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm... well it's an adaptec 3940UW.... with a aic7880 controller... two 
<BR>
of them. Termination could be a problem... as the cable is a really old 
<BR>
one... and it looks in bad shape. I will try to find a newer cable and 
<BR>
see what happens... 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;	3) does something bad so that after I ctrl-alt-del and go back to 
</EM><BR>
milo
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;and run a good kernel, the keyboard is disabled and the cd-rom 
</EM><BR>
flakes.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Yup, I've also had this problem since day one.... if I reboot from 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; MILO... my system hangs during boot... if I cold boot it (reset 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; switch)... I'm fine.... My system is total SCSI... 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;My situation isn't as severe that I remember, but I get some similar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problems on a soft (warm) reset of an experimental kernel.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;	These behaviors seem odd since the kernel is supposed to be 
</EM><BR>
reasonably
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;stable...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ditto.
</EM><BR>
