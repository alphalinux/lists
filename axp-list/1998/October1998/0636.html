<EM>&gt; I even posted it here and no one could help me. Then I took the card

<EM>&gt; You might measure the resistance as well before starting to solder

<EM>&gt; This is actually what Digital is apparently doing. They sell a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; special cable for this board which apparently has the resistor built
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in and &quot;magically&quot; makes the image look better!
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks a ton, Tom.  I'll give it a shot as soon as possible.  One question
<BR>
more though, about this cable you say that DEC is selling..  Is it possible
<BR>
to still buy one, and where did you hear about it?  If I can still get one,
<BR>
I'd prefer doing that because my onsale box is still under warrantee. :)
<BR>
I'll go and measure the impedence right now.
