<P>
Please let's take this off the list.  I'll respond once more
<BR>
here but this is seriouly off topic.  Bob asks me a question
<BR>
in public so I answer in public.  But please write to me 
<BR>
off line about this if you must but I am out of town till
<BR>
Wends.

<EM>&gt; If you are going to post someone's email without permission, it would

<EM>&gt; at least be fair to show exactly *what* this person was responding to.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As it stands, you may have asked for this response.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sorry, I didn't think to keep a copy and he did not return
<BR>
a quote.  I did try to paraphrase my message.  It was only
<BR>
three lines of text I sent and I think I was polite.  I did
<BR>
point out that placing an ad under the wrong heading
<BR>
could backfire on him.  Yes more people will see it but
<BR>
what will they think when they do?  I did not even tell him
<BR>
not to do what he did.  I don't even think what he did
<BR>
crosses the line to being SPAM.  
<BR>
<P>He sent me many e-mails and made some phone calls.  He even
<BR>
called every extension in my office.  I could hear one
<BR>
phone ring after the next.  Mostly empty cubicles. I think
<BR>
he must of been trying to tell co-workers about how upsaet
<BR>
he was with me  The guy may be a real nut.  I don't know.  
<BR>
<P>I told him if he didn't stop I'd post his writings to a public
<BR>
place.  It worked.  Not one more e-mail after my posting.
<BR>
<P>Now assume you are correct and &quot;I may have asked for this response&quot;
<BR>
what could I have done?  Suppose I say to you now &quot;You are
<BR>
a scum scucking A** H***, you jerk, you deserve to die&quot;.
<BR>
Would you then spend the rest of the day  writing numberus
<BR>
e-mails and making a dozen long distance phone calls
<BR>
leaving voice mail on random phone extensions?  No I bet
<BR>
you'd simply think I was an idiot not worth your time.  The
<BR>
guy started an hours long one sided dialog with me.  I just
<BR>
wanted. to make him shut up. It seems to have worked.  Now
<BR>
I'll shut up.
<BR>
<P>I still don't make a judgment.  I don't know the guy.
<BR>
