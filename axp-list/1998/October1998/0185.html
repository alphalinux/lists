<P>
Did anybody read what Chris wrote?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   I bought four 8MB 72pin 36-bit SIMMs.  
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^^^
<BR>
This should be just fine--as I read it, 36-bit SIMMs equals parity SIMMs.
<BR>
I'm surprised it didn't work.  Let's see, Chris, you also mention 24 
<BR>
identical chips--12 on each side...  Are you sure?  My guess is that of
<BR>
the 24 chips, you have
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 8 1x4Mbit (or 4x1Mbit) chips on side A (4MB, no parity)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 8 1x4Mbit (or 4x1Mbit) chips on side B (4MB, no parity)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 4 1x1Mbit chips on side A (one-half of the 8Mbit (1MByte) for parity)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 4 1x1Mbit chips on side B (the other half of the 8Mbit (1MByte) for parity)
<BR>
<P>So, if you look closely, you should see that four of the chips on each side
<BR>
actually have a different part number.  This should still be just fine,
<BR>
as it works out to 8MB with parity.
<BR>
<P>Moreover, some people said you needed ECC memory instead of parity.  That's
<BR>
bogus.  As far as I know, there is no such thing as ECC memory in 72pin
<BR>
format--use parity (36-bit memory as it's advertized), and let the Alpha
<BR>
use it as a 72 bit data path, generating 8 bits of ECC for each 64 bits
<BR>
of data.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Next I round up some 30 pin SIMMS and a pair of 30 -&gt; 72 pin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   converters.  I put this in and now I see something on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   monitor.  It is all green with a white block cursor on the lower
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   left.  But that's it.  The machine is totally unresponsive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Waiting doe not seem to help after 30 minutes it is the same.
</EM><BR>
<P>The fact that you get somewhere with the 30 pin SIMMS suggests that maybe
<BR>
the 72pin memory that you said you had isn't working. (??)  I don't know
<BR>
what to make of this unless somehow, the 8MB SIMMs you have aren't really 
<BR>
parity (despite my &quot;chip counting&quot; above), or are bad or something.
<BR>
<P>The white block cursor in the lower left is an indication that your
<BR>
battery is dead.  At least that's what it did for me.  When I unplugged
<BR>
the battery cube and tested it, it read 1.05V.  I replaced it and the
<BR>
booting commenced.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;   Is something other then generic 36-bit RAM required? 
</EM><BR>
<P>That's what I am using.  I have tried generic 36-bit 8MB, 16MB, and 32MB
<BR>
SIMMs--all have worked perfectly.  If you want, copy down the exact 
<BR>
numbers and letters on all the chips on each side of each SIMM, (email
<BR>
me privately), and I'll look up exactly what you've got.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2) The machine came with a 4.5V clock battery.  Does anyone know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   how to check it.  It measures 4.5V under no load condition but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   I know this is a poor way o test.  Or should I assume the little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   cube shaped thing is dead and replace it.  I assume a could use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   three AA batteries in series.  Any problem with this idea? 
</EM><BR>
<P>As someone said, if it reads 4.5V under no load, it should be okay.  My
<BR>
dead one only registered 1.05V.  But if you get the solid block cursor
<BR>
in the lower left, that sounds like a dead one too.  I believe you can 
<BR>
try to boot without the battery installed--you'll just have to reset
<BR>
the clock every time you power off.  You could try this just to see 
<BR>
if you get further.  If you do, replace the battery anyway.
<BR>

<P><P>P.S.  Please don't flame me for my big parity memory analysis--I'm a math
<BR>
dork.
