<EM>&gt; Well, as part of the AbiWord team, I can assure you that we're doing many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such assignment tests in the code (not good news, huh? :).  In fact, the new 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; toolbar framework is similar to the implementation of the menu layout
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; framework.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In short, this looks like a compiler issue on the Alpha, but without access
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha (which I may have shortly if I buy one) it's hard to tell.  It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a very legal C++ test; I'm using EGCS 1.1b with -Wall and often -pedantic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to keep out &quot;that which is not ANSI,&quot; but on an Intel, which is all we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have available now. 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>First, much thanks to all who responded to my question. My main point is that
<BR>
the code *does* run on an Intel machine but not on (at least my) Alpha, so this
<BR>
list seemed an appropriate place to ask.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You know, this may be completely off here, but I'm wondering if the &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is somehow not correct in ANDing the result of (wd-&gt;m_id == id) on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; platform where the size of &quot;wd&quot; (pointer) is not the same size as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;(wd-&gt;m_id == id)&quot; (bool same as int which is != size of pointer?).  Wild
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guess here.  :)  I would assume this possibility is very remote 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since the evaluation is essentially &quot;if(wd){if(wd-&gt;m_id==id) {} }&quot;, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I haven't looked at the compiler source; it may be optimizing something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; funny.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Most problems where code runs on an Intel and not on an Alpha seem to be
<BR>
related to the pointer/integer size difference so what you say may make sense.
<BR>
<P>I'm considering dropping back from egcs 1.1b to 1.0.3a to see what happens. As
<BR>
you know the code is already being compiled with no optimizations. 
<BR>
<P>Heinz Ulrich Stille asked whether callback_action was 32 or 64 bit, I'm not
<BR>
enough of a programmer to know the answer to this.
<BR>
<P>The lack of a decent WP for the alpha platform has been a real bugaboo for me,
<BR>
so I'd really like to see this problem resolved, any additional alpha-guru
<BR>
suggestions are always appreciated.
