Greetings,
<BR>
<P>The Linux/Alpha platform is fast becoming recognized as having the best
<BR>
price/performance for scientific computation.  This was recognized as
<BR>
early as around two years ago, when Digital Domain put 200 Linux/Alpha
<BR>
machines together to do the rendering for the movie Titanic, and more
<BR>
recently as the Avalon cluster at Los Alamos became the #114
<BR>
supercomputer in the world at a total cost of around $300K.
<BR>
<P>In the last few months, several developments have enhanced the
<BR>
performance of this platform, including the Free-Fast-Math library of
<BR>
Joachim Wesner and Kazushige Goto, and Mr. (Dr.?) Goto's hand-coded
<BR>
assembler BLAS (basic linear algebra subroutines) which multiply
<BR>
matrices faster than any other single-processor machine in the world (I
<BR>
think- well, at least anything else within 10 times the price).
<BR>
Johannes Hausmann has put these and other fast linear algebra routines
<BR>
into a single fastmath/BLAS/LAPACK RPM builder which greatly simplifies
<BR>
installation of these disparate pieces.
<BR>
<P>Richard Payne has put together a page to summarize these and other
<BR>
high-performance efforts at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.alphalinux.org/docs/high_perf.html.">http://www.alphalinux.org/docs/high_perf.html.</A>  In response to this
<BR>
page, it was suggested that a mailing list be created to discuss these
<BR>
topics.
<BR>
<P>This list has been created, and is open to new members.  To join, simply
<BR>
send me email.  (If you reply to this, make sure *my* email address is
<BR>
in the To: field, not a list address.)  Possible discussion topics might
<BR>
include:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Tuning of existing routines for improved speed, e.g. block size
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;issues, performance on 21164PC sans on-chip L2 cache, etc.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* New routines to accelerate FFTs, sparse matrix solvers, FEM/BEM
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;matrix construction, etc.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Requests for help with coding of inner loops of custom codes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(neural nets? spreadsheets?  mozilla?), including assembler
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instruction scheduling, cache issues, etc.
<BR>
<P>I suspect the list will focus on scientific computation, but any
<BR>
high-performance topic is welcome.
<BR>
<P>Note: this list is based on decade-old non-majordmo list technology, and
<BR>
list updates can take hours, or if I am unreachable, potentially days.
<BR>
It will not have an archive right away, but I will save all messages and
<BR>
will gladly honor forwarding requests.  If anyone has a better list
<BR>
server available, then perhaps the list should be hosted there; in the
<BR>
meantime, I'm making available what I have.
<BR>
<P>Cheers and happy hacking!
