<P>
I have managed to bulid a system that is using a RAID1 root file system. 
<BR>
Here are some observations and comments on the whole experiance.
<BR>
<P>I am running raidtools-19981005-B-0.90 and 2.1.124 patched with 
<BR>
raid0145-19981005-C-2.1.124. I have also hacked together an RPM for 
<BR>
raidtools-19981005-B-0.90 but it still needs a little work.
<BR>
<P>Root raid(1) works with MILO for booting since MILO only reads the disk 
<BR>
on boot and since with RAID1 the disk image is unaltered from what a 
<BR>
normal disk all is ok. This by the way is what Sun supports with there 
<BR>
own software raid solution.
<BR>
<P>System booting seems to be no problem and quite reliable. I have been 
<BR>
able to boot from both drives. Halting the system requierd some work 
<BR>
though since it seems that raidstop --all will not stop all the drives in 
<BR>
use. I also was under the impression that the root partition would be 
<BR>
stopped as part of the halt/reboot sequence. I managed to resolve these 
<BR>
problems by using raidstop --readonly /dev/mdX for all of the running 
<BR>
devices. 
<BR>
<P>The biggest problem I had was building the root partition. I ended up 
<BR>
installing linux on a different partition and then installing the 
<BR>
raidtools to build a raid1 set and then dump/restoring the installed root 
<BR>
partition onto the new raid1 partition. This was a bit of a pain since I 
<BR>
like to have one large partition instead of several smaller ones. 
<BR>
<P>My first try was to create a raid1 set that had only one disk in it and 
<BR>
then dump/restore the installed parttion over to the new raid1 set. After 
<BR>
the set was created I would raidaddhot the original disk to the set. This 
<BR>
did not work. What is needed here is the ability to adjust the 
<BR>
configuration of a raid set after is is built or the ability to create a 
<BR>
raid set with some drives marked as bad so they will not be used when the 
<BR>
set is created.
<BR>
<P>The process that would be workable is to:
<BR>
1) install your system on sda1
<BR>
2) install raidtools
<BR>
3) create a raid1 md0 set with sdb1 and sda1 but sda1 is marked as bad.
<BR>
4) mkfs on md0
<BR>
5) dump/restore sda1 to md0
<BR>
6) reboot from sdb1 with root=/dev/md0
<BR>
7) raidaddhot sda1 to md0
<BR>
8) we now have working root raid1 system.
<BR>
<P>An alternate solution would be to:
<BR>
1) install your system on sda1
<BR>
2) install raidtools
<BR>
3) shrink the fs on sda1 to match the size the will be left after 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;applying mkraid.(I am not sure how much this will screw up the FS)
<BR>
4) create a raid1 md0 set with sda1 and sdb1 but sdb1 is marked as bad
<BR>
5) reboot from sda1 with root=/dev/md0
<BR>
6) raidaddhot sdb1 to md0
<BR>
7) we now have a raid1 root with one less step.
<BR>
<P>The second plan is somewhat like what Sun does to create a root raid on a 
<BR>
running system, with the exception of the FS srhink since they save there 
<BR>
control information in an other place on the disk.
<BR>
<P>I have yet to do extensive testing on the system but after a couple of 
<BR>
days It still seems stable so I am hopefull.
