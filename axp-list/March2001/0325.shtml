It depends on how much you want to spend, and the capacity/speed you require.  (My
<BR>
favorite drive is the STK 9840 which stores 20GB at 9MB/sec (native) and locates
<BR>
files on tape in usually 3-5 seconds, but the five-figure pricing understandably
<BR>
puts off most punters).
<BR>
I think one of the best value drives on the market today is the solutions offered
<BR>
by Ecrix (<A HREF="http://www.ecrix.com">http://www.ecrix.com</A>) which uses a high-reliability 8mm helical
<BR>
solution.  I think the street-price of these are around $750 or so for the
<BR>
internal units.  33GB capacity and 3MB/sec (native figures without compression).
<BR>
For a cheaper solution, the Travan5 drives aren't too bad -- 10GB capacity,
<BR>
reasonable speed ... but Travan/QIC drives aren't as reliable as some of the other
<BR>
technologies, but they're available for $250-350 for the bare drives, and are
<BR>
available SCSI, USB, ATA.
<BR>
Most tape drives, providing they're attached to a linux-supported host adapter are
<BR>
plug'n'play.  There are of course exceptions if the hardware is funky -- OnStream
<BR>
(RIP) springs to mind.
<BR>
The HP DAT drives too are excellent, especially because of the nice OBDR
<BR>
capability (not sure if there are any linux backup solutions that capitalize on
<BR>
this yet).
<BR>
DLT drives are usually chosen by installations that demand *proven* reliability.
<BR>
They are expensive, and laboriously slow at seeking/locating files, but they've
<BR>
been around since the turn-of-the-last-century (or at least it seems like it).
<BR>
Developed by DEC, back in the day... now owned by Quantum.  In this ~$3500
<BR>
territory AIT1/2 by Sony (and Exabyte's similar M2) are making inroads as the
<BR>
technology stabilizes and proves itself as a reliable medium.

Subject: OT: tape backup
<BR>
<P><P>Based on my recent experiences, I want a more robust backup solution.  I
<BR>
am looking to aquire a tape drive.  As this is not being payed for by a
<BR>
buisness I need a cost effective solution.  I prefer SCSI (I am using the
<BR>
Qlogic isp1020 as reported by /proc/scsi).  Any suggestions or ideas?
<BR>
What is the best drive for the money?  I will be backing up FAT32, EXT2,
<BR>
Reiserfs, UFS, HPFS, (and maybe other) filesystems.  I would like to
<BR>
manage it all on my alpha, although I can put it in a x86 box that I have
<BR>
if necessary (cost/performance driven, etc.).  My apologies for the two OT
<BR>
posts in one weekend.  Thanks for your help.
