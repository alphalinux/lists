<P>
With regards to your message at 01:29 PM 4/9/01, KirkE@paccessglobal.com. 
<BR>
Where you stated:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Chris,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I think the real issue with VMS and Tru64 support is a matter of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the operating systems don't support most of the inexpensive hardware or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;much hardware without the compaq firmware.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yes indeed, you are pretty limited on your bootable/supported hardware for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;these two OSs.  One big loss is Intraserver which used to provide a much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cheaper alternative to Compaq OEM SCSI/Network/Video controllers (including
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;combo cards). Compaq is no longer going to produce drivers or SRM updates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the recognize the Intraserver controllers properly, making them effectively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;unsupported&quot; which puts your support contract at risk (as well as making it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;necessary to hack the SRM and driver in order to get it to work, if your not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;under a support contract but want to run Tru64 or OVMS at home as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hobbyst).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;--KE
</EM><BR>
Intraserver is still around, and their cards are still available.
<BR>
What HAS changed is that for U160 SCSI3 support Compaq opted to go with 
<BR>
Adaptec.
<BR>
Good news is availability, bad news ( in my opinion) is that Adaptec sucks..
<BR>
You have the scenario above backwards. It was not that Compaq isn't 
<BR>
supporting Intraserver, rather that they are supporting Adaptec, and 
<BR>
Intraserver uses LSI/Symbios chips.
<BR>
Frankly, unless you are running a lot of disks it is not relevant, as the 
<BR>
existing LVD Ultra80 stuff (SCSI2) is still faster than a couple of hard 
<BR>
disks on a SCSI bus, so there is no advantage to SCSI3 for most applications..
