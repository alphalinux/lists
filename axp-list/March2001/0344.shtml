Of course I checked prices -- with TechData, a major distributor.  Congrats with
<BR>
finding DLT media for $54 -- that's a great deal, and yes that's cheaper than
<BR>
Ecrix media,  but note that the DLT7000 is around $1000 more to purchase.
<BR>
Ampex now have quad-density that allows 660GB per cartridge.  You seem to take
<BR>
great delight in pointing out the most minor of mistakes, so please allow me to
<BR>
return the favor:
<BR>
<P>What school of math are you using ?
<BR>
DLT IV cart = 40GB native capacity (only with DLT8000) = $54
<BR>
$54 / 40GB  =  $1.35/GB
<BR>
LTO = 100GB native = $131 (per pricewatch)
<BR>
$131 / 100 = $1.31/GB
<BR>
<P>Seems to me that $1.31/GB &lt; $1.35, maybe you just like to pay more per GB.  If you
<BR>
use the more common DLT4000 or DLT7000, the $/GB figures for DLT are much worse.
<BR>

<EM>&gt; I think it fairly clear from my previous post that I was quoting pricing on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; single tape cart -- not $/GB ratios.  If you want the best value $/GB, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably LTO with its 100GB native capacity makes better sense, or hell, maybe a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DST with 660GB native cartridges at only $445 each is a bargain (of course, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would have to use a lot of tapes to recoup the original $130K investment -- that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does tend to put off quite a few people).
</EM><BR>
<P>Comparing a single cart vs some other cart is not useful without 
<BR>
considering size and cost. Either way, your statement was incorrect 
<BR>
vs DLT. A DLT4 cart is $54. Check pricewatch. LTO are worse per GB 
<BR>
than DLT. Ampex DST are so esoteric as to be relegated to the
<BR>
companies where money is not much of a problem. I've used them 
<BR>
though on Sun's and RS/6000's. Not exactly a standard tape drive 
<BR>
interface so it's unlikely to attach to a Linux box. Also, Ampex's 
<BR>
site says 330GB per tape, not 660GB.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As I mentioned in my original response, it very much depends how much you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; willing to spend, how much capacity you need, and how long your backup window
</EM><BR>
is.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Other factors also come into play -- how many times can a tape be *reliably*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reused, and the overall reliability of the drive.  MTBF figures are usually
</EM><BR>
quoted
<BR>
<EM>&gt; by the manufacturer, often using the technical &quot;finger in the air&quot; method of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; measurement.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>True. Pretty much ignore manufacturer MTBF because it's not possible 
<BR>
to really know it, except on long established drives, like DLT's and
<BR>
8mm.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; BTW, I think my eyeballs are just fine, thank you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>OK. Try looking at pricewatch or your favorite pricing site before 
<BR>
quoting prices next time.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Ecrix VXA-1 media is around $65 -- much more expensive that 4mm media, a

little

<EM>&gt; You better get new eyeballs. DLT is cheaper as is M2 per GB.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't use AIT so I won't comment but a simple search on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pricewatch will tell the true picture. If you want the best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deal on $$/GB, use CD-R, then 8mm 5GB.
