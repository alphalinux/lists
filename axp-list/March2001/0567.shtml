<EM>&gt;Peter,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;- EV6 is way too expensive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You've got that right.  Like you, I'm waiting to see the results of the IBM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fabbing of the Alpha. They are a good source for silicon, Sun Ecache debacle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aside.
</EM><BR>
<P>Even IBM fab. Alpha CPU, who is going to assemble into SlotB or something 
<BR>
like that?
<BR>
or Who would make planner?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Alternatives? 21164A and 21164PC fabbed at todays more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;efficient micron yields and clocked higher. I suspect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;a 700MHz 21164PC would be more than adaquate for a LCA.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Who would fab the 21164A/21164PCx parts?  Mitsubishi fabbed 21164PC for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;time, they could pick it up again if they could make some profit off of it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe there is no reason to go back in 164, no way... it is cheaper now 
<BR>
to create
<BR>
UP1500 than 164 system.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If you want AGP, you can't use Tsunami/Typhoon (a pricey chipset that's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;great for servers), leaving the AMD and VIA chipsets as the only options.
</EM><BR>
<P>I thought Compaq is working on AGP support for ES45...VX1 AGP for Tru64...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;- Wait and see how the UP1500 does and go from there.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't hope for re-fabbing 164, but waiting to see this UP1500 to come 
<BR>
down the price
<BR>
by the end of this year....crossing my fingers.
<BR>
<P><P>And stable supply of 833 slotB that makes more sense to HPTC.
<BR>
