Greetings all,
<BR>
<P>Whilst tampering with my Xserver configuration files (XF86Conf) in an
<BR>
attempt to use the Matrox drivers instead of the default Super VGA drivers,
<BR>
I managed somehow to damage the settings for several of Xserv's dependent
<BR>
daemons, including the font server.  Strangely, it complains about a front
<BR>
server based on True Type fonts during automatic system startup or manually
<BR>
invoking X, but continues to load.  Having searched the directory tree, it
<BR>
looks like I never had a True Type directory, only Type 1 PostScript fonts.
<BR>
<P>I compared the original configuration file created by Anaconda during
<BR>
install, but it references the same TType directories, though I do not
<BR>
recall any errors, what gives?
<BR>
<P>Also, I noticed several tools for configuring the Xserver which I presume to
<BR>
have been partly X generic, Red Hat derived and XFree derived.  There was
<BR>
XF86Configurator, XF86Config, X86Cfg and a few others.  Each of these seems
<BR>
to write the XF86Conf file differently as though different versions of XFree
<BR>
were being targetted (though it does not give any warning of this).
<BR>
<P>Perhaps If I understood which tool was the correct one, I could
<BR>
simultaneously fix the font server problem (it complians, but still loads
<BR>
the X session, albeit with odd looking screen fonts) as well as tune my
<BR>
configuration file.
<BR>
<P>Right now, I have a hand built XF86Conf file with bits from each of the X
<BR>
configuration tools, though when I passed it the directory to the Type 1
<BR>
Post Script fonts that Red Hat's original installer created, it refuses to
<BR>
recognize it as a legitimate directory.  Perhaps the font server that is
<BR>
being loaded is not Type 1 PS aware but True Type?
<BR>
<P>I was tempted to see if I could install Metro or the other pay-ware Xservers
<BR>
just to see what it's configuration looked like and then de-install the
<BR>
demo. I've read through the XFree documentation, but do not see anything
<BR>
specific to this issue.  I thought that saving the original configuration
<BR>
file would be sufficient, but clearly some other configuration file has been
<BR>
touched.
<BR>
<P>Your assistance is appreciated.

<P>No, my hack isn't needed, but ignoring disabled ROMs makes a sense

in any case.

<P>Looking at 4.0 code I have an impression that they try to use OS
<BR>
facilities if possible...
<BR>
Interesting, XFree86 on linux *does* read /proc/bus/pci/devices
<BR>
(Xserver/hw/xfree86/os-support/linux/lnx_pci.c:xf86GetPciSizeFromOS()),
<BR>
but obviously it fails sometimes. So we just need to fix this
<BR>
function (or kernel, whichever is broken ;-)
<BR>
I'll investigate this tomorrow.
<BR>
<P>Ivan.
