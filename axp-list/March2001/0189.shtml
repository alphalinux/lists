<P>
On 164LX/SX machines you can &quot;cheat&quot;:
<BR>
<P>Type &quot;AlphaBIOS&quot; or &quot;ARC&quot; and the system will look for the ROM image on a
<BR>
floppy.  If you have AlphaBIOS 5.7 on floppy (as any good Alpha
<BR>
administrator who supports NT would) you can boot AlphaBIOS without having
<BR>
it in ROM.  Its slow as molasses but it does work and is a little known
<BR>
cheat on half-flash Alphas.  Most of the PWS line, except for the &quot;A&quot; models
<BR>
had 2MB flash EEPROM and could hold SRM and AlphaBIOS concurrently, all you
<BR>
had to do was to switch console to run the OS of your choice.
