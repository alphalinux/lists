Subject: API/Compaq platform approach vs. Sun, was RE: &quot;chipsets&quot;
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Greg,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;API already has the UP1100, which uses AMD's chipset. I haven't asked,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;but one would presume that they will continue to have a low-end
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;machine using the least expensive motherboard possible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have been informed that UP1100 is EOL.  As is the older SlotB based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; UP1000.  At this point, only the Samsung product (not an API product) with
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; name dangerously similar to those built and sold by APIis slated to have
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; AMD Iron Gate G4 (761), dubiously named the UP1500. Samsung has some info
</EM><BR>
on
<BR>
<EM>&gt; their site about it, though it is still under &quot;development.&quot; At first I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thought that the UP1500 would be a fairly innovative offering to provide
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha platform community with an &quot;enthusiast&quot;/ entry level programmer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; workstation or web appliance.  On closer inspection however, it looks like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it has retained the rather unusual UP1100 non-standard ATX arrangement, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; detail pointed out to me by a colleague.  This isn't much of a problem in
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; desk side workstation I should think, but would probably pose a problem in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sourcing rack mount chassis that would fit without obscuring slots, drives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or memory banks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sun has managed to produce some excellent low-cost systems that are
</EM><BR>
selling
<BR>
<EM>&gt; like hotcakes.  The added benefit is that exposure and access ultimately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leads to increased acceptance and a larger user base, along with the
</EM><BR>
obvious
<BR>
<EM>&gt; benefit of more software (and often better software). The Sun Blade 100,
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Netra X1 AC200 and the new line of SPARCEngine motherboards including the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AXi and the AXe are making it easier and cheaper to buy, build or OEM an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ultra SPARC II based system (and soon enough, Ultra III). I bought an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SPARCEngine AXi with a 360MHz UIIi CPU and 256MB of RAM from NU Horizons
</EM><BR>
for
<BR>
<EM>&gt; little more than $700.00.  An Ultra 30 coming off of lease soon followed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's now possible to obtain a 500 MHz IIe system like the Netra X1 or the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sun Blade 100 for less than $1,000, but there is absolutely nothing
</EM><BR>
similar
<BR>
<EM>&gt; in the Alpha arsenal.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Having broached the question more than once for a quote from most of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vendors still selling Alpha solutions, obtaining a 4.5 year old 164LX
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; motherboard with a 533 or 600MHz EV56 CPU is usually about a $900 to $1200
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proposition, and that's before integrating an actual system together.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Having gone this route in the past, I'm inclined to suggest to obtaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systems that are already fully integrated and guaranteed fully functional.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I obtained my last Alpha through Ebay auctions and scored a PWS 600au with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 512MB memory and an 18GB drive for under $1,000 (not the going rate, even
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; year later).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; At current, the only practical, low cost option for Alpha platform
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enthusiasts (ranging from the stalwart OpenVMS crowd/DECUS groups, the BSD
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; camp, the living-dead of the Alpha/NT camp and the Alpha/Linux camp),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; students or programmers is for obtaining out of date hardware through the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; auction sites or calling up leasing companies that occasionally give up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Digital branded workstations and servers for a song. It could be said
</EM><BR>
there
<BR>
<EM>&gt; is no Alpha workstation market anymore, but what are all those clustered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha systems that are filling the computing media being programmed on?
</EM><BR>
How
<BR>
<EM>&gt; many people on this list would be willing to part with $1,500 or so to be
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; fully integrated &quot;Sun Blade&quot; style Alpha, just to keep their stake in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; platform, write some code and keep their platform specific skills up? If
</EM><BR>
it
<BR>
<EM>&gt; could run OpenVMS and Tru64, there would be an automatic market in the
</EM><BR>
DECUS
<BR>
<EM>&gt; crowd and plenty of shops with an OpenVMS and Tru64 investment would snap
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them up. Linux users would love them as they would be price competitive
</EM><BR>
with
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Athlon Thunderbirds on the X86 front. Whatever replaces the UP1x00 needs
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; address these issues, its been so long since a cost-effective solution
</EM><BR>
worth
<BR>
<EM>&gt; buying has come out, they'd be all the rage.  There would be dozens of
</EM><BR>
ways
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to promote such a system.  Sun is proof enough it can be done (remember
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt; an old Ultra II based system like the Ultra Enterprise 450 workgroup
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; server/workstation still fetches some $20,000 for the base unit and
</EM><BR>
another
<BR>
<EM>&gt; $2800 per 450MHz CPU).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Good day,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; --KE
