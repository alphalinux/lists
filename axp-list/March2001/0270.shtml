Ya, I think the first char in the model# after ST denotes the form-factor.  IIRC,
<BR>
the number 4 is used to denote full-height 5.25in form-factor -- I used to use
<BR>
some old Seagate Elites, that were state-of-the-art cause they had the high spin
<BR>
speed of 5400 RPM, and they cost a packet too -- all for 1.6GB.  Them were the
<BR>
days.  I remember thinking how anyone would fill up a 10MB HD in my first PC.  And
<BR>
then along came bloatware and solved that problem.  And the drives got bigger, and
<BR>
there was much rejoicing.  And lo, a leviathan did appear, and it was to be called
<BR>
MP3, and verily it begat DivX, and there was much gnashing of teeth.  And then Max
<BR>
of Tor made proclamation of Diamonds and there were 80 GB available to the masses.
<BR>
And then some sysadmin did scream, &quot;How the bloody hell am I gonna back up this
<BR>
little lot ?!&quot;.
<BR>
But I digest....

<P>They're not full-height, they're just not low-profile, like most modern

SCSI drives are.  They are half-height drives.  You may be thinking of the
<BR>
old Hawk series, which was full-height and quite slow (3600 RPM).
<BR>
<P>I've got a ST15150N on my desk right now that I just &quot;retired&quot; to lighter
<BR>
duty.  It ran in my SX off of a Tekram 390F for years and never showed a
<BR>
problem (actually, both did...I have two of them, which I recently
<BR>
replaced with three 9GB Barracudas).  I also have an old 2GB Hawk sitting
<BR>
here, which, despite a VERY slow spin-up, works well to this day.
