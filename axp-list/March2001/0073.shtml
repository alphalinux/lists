<P>
Believe me, I understand the frustration (I experience it all the time as
<BR>
well).  There are a couple of problems, FWIU, however.  First of all, there is a
<BR>
_very_ small group of people with the ability to write this type of code
<BR>
(remember, PAL has to work directly with the hardware, and it has to fit into
<BR>
the PROM, so a lot of the &quot;helpers&quot; we're used to don't exist).  Secondly, the
<BR>
list of adapters that people would want _far_ outstrips the amount of time these
<BR>
excellent engineers have available to them.  And finally, I've been told there
<BR>
are some things in the PAL that Compaq will never allow to be seen because they
<BR>
are _that_ much of a competitive advantage (this could be wrong, I don't know).
<BR>
<P>If we can get a very small list of adapters everyone thinks are critical to
<BR>
Alpha Linux acceptance, maybe a business case could be made.  Maybe not, I don't
<BR>
know.  I know that everyone wants 2940 adapters to be supported (the 39160s
<BR>
already are under 5.8, maybe earlier), how about video cards - what's the #1
<BR>
video card everyone wants to be able to use that doesn't already work?
<BR>
Remember, the latest SRM is 5.8.
<BR>
<P>I just want to be clear here - I'm not promising anything personally, and I'm
<BR>
certainly not promising anything from Compaq.  I'm just saying that a little
<BR>
organized thinking about what is the most important might get us a little closer
<BR>
to what people are looking for in the next rev. or two.  It will certainly get
<BR>
us closer than just complaining. ;)
