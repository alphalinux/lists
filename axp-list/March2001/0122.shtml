<P>
<EM>&gt;   excellent engineers have available to them.  And finally, I've been told there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   are some things in the PAL that Compaq will never allow to be seen because they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   are _that_ much of a competitive advantage (this could be wrong, I don't know).
</EM><BR>
<P>One would guess that those items relate to the Wildfire/Galaxy boxes... 
<BR>
namely the &quot;console system&quot; -- which only exists on the high-end boxes.
<BR>
And the serious competitive advantage which it gave Digital was lost when
<BR>
Alpha NT was dropped. Who cares about running VMS, Tru64 and NT (now Linux)
<BR>
SIMULTANEOUSLY on your DS10, or even XP1000? Only a couple of existing VMS
<BR>
customers did - and they wanted to do it on a GS box anyway. Now they want
<BR>
to do it on Wildfire adding in Tandem's NSK.
<BR>
<P>If you don't know what I'm babbling about, chalk it up to &quot;stealth
<BR>
marketing.&quot;  So much for a &quot;competitive advantage&quot; that is so well known
<BR>
and in such demand that everybody else is trying to emulate it!
<BR>
<P>[From an engineering point of view, it is a jaw-dropping thing to watch.]
