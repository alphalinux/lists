<P>
Greg,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;API already has the UP1100, which uses AMD's chipset. I haven't asked,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but one would presume that they will continue to have a low-end
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;machine using the least expensive motherboard possible.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have been informed that UP1100 is EOL.  As is the older SlotB based
<BR>
UP1000.  At this point, only the Samsung product (not an API product) with a
<BR>
name dangerously similar to those built and sold by APIis slated to have the
<BR>
AMD Iron Gate G4 (761), dubiously named the UP1500. Samsung has some info on
<BR>
their site about it, though it is still under &quot;development.&quot; At first I
<BR>
thought that the UP1500 would be a fairly innovative offering to provide the
<BR>
Alpha platform community with an &quot;enthusiast&quot;/ entry level programmer
<BR>
workstation or web appliance.  On closer inspection however, it looks like
<BR>
it has retained the rather unusual UP1100 non-standard ATX arrangement, a
<BR>
detail pointed out to me by a colleague.  This isn't much of a problem in a
<BR>
desk side workstation I should think, but would probably pose a problem in
<BR>
sourcing rack mount chassis that would fit without obscuring slots, drives
<BR>
or memory banks. 
<BR>
<P>Sun has managed to produce some excellent low-cost systems that are selling
<BR>
like hotcakes.  The added benefit is that exposure and access ultimately
<BR>
leads to increased acceptance and a larger user base, along with the obvious
<BR>
benefit of more software (and often better software). The Sun Blade 100, the
<BR>
Netra X1 AC200 and the new line of SPARCEngine motherboards including the
<BR>
AXi and the AXe are making it easier and cheaper to buy, build or OEM an
<BR>
Ultra SPARC II based system (and soon enough, Ultra III). I bought an
<BR>
SPARCEngine AXi with a 360MHz UIIi CPU and 256MB of RAM from NU Horizons for
<BR>
little more than $700.00.  An Ultra 30 coming off of lease soon followed.
<BR>
It's now possible to obtain a 500 MHz IIe system like the Netra X1 or the
<BR>
Sun Blade 100 for less than $1,000, but there is absolutely nothing similar
<BR>
in the Alpha arsenal. 
<BR>
<P>Having broached the question more than once for a quote from most of the
<BR>
vendors still selling Alpha solutions, obtaining a 4.5 year old 164LX
<BR>
motherboard with a 533 or 600MHz EV56 CPU is usually about a $900 to $1200
<BR>
proposition, and that's before integrating an actual system together.
<BR>
Having gone this route in the past, I'm inclined to suggest to obtaining
<BR>
systems that are already fully integrated and guaranteed fully functional.
<BR>
I obtained my last Alpha through Ebay auctions and scored a PWS 600au with
<BR>
512MB memory and an 18GB drive for under $1,000 (not the going rate, even a
<BR>
year later).
<BR>
<P>At current, the only practical, low cost option for Alpha platform
<BR>
enthusiasts (ranging from the stalwart OpenVMS crowd/DECUS groups, the BSD
<BR>
camp, the living-dead of the Alpha/NT camp and the Alpha/Linux camp),
<BR>
students or programmers is for obtaining out of date hardware through the
<BR>
auction sites or calling up leasing companies that occasionally give up
<BR>
Digital branded workstations and servers for a song. It could be said there
<BR>
is no Alpha workstation market anymore, but what are all those clustered
<BR>
Alpha systems that are filling the computing media being programmed on? How
<BR>
many people on this list would be willing to part with $1,500 or so to be a
<BR>
fully integrated &quot;Sun Blade&quot; style Alpha, just to keep their stake in the
<BR>
platform, write some code and keep their platform specific skills up? If it
<BR>
could run OpenVMS and Tru64, there would be an automatic market in the DECUS
<BR>
crowd and plenty of shops with an OpenVMS and Tru64 investment would snap
<BR>
them up. Linux users would love them as they would be price competitive with
<BR>
Athlon Thunderbirds on the X86 front. Whatever replaces the UP1x00 needs to
<BR>
address these issues, its been so long since a cost-effective solution worth
<BR>
buying has come out, they'd be all the rage.  There would be dozens of ways
<BR>
to promote such a system.  Sun is proof enough it can be done (remember that
<BR>
an old Ultra II based system like the Ultra Enterprise 450 workgroup
<BR>
server/workstation still fetches some $20,000 for the base unit and another
<BR>
$2800 per 450MHz CPU). 
<BR>
<P>Good day,
<BR>
