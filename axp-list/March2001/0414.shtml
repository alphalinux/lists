<P><EM>&gt; Yes. Nearly nil comparing to anything related with high-performance

<EM>&gt; computing (again, in my books).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Have you ever approached Compaq to buy even nowadays-lowly (imho)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DS20 for University and hear the price they are selling it at ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why do I need to think that the guys who are getting such money
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for their computers can't afford 2 sticks at around 1000$ ?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, because after all the engineering directly get the cash from the sale
<BR>
I'm sure.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and more importantly what they would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have cost when the SX was being developed?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Note that I wasn't talking about times when SX was developed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This discussion is taking place this week, and there was plently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of time to check that since than. As Jay asked *me* if I checked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it myself I surely felt uncertain if it has been ever done.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but how many SXs do you think they have sitting in Compaq? and you
<BR>
think that just because you ask a question on this list, Jay or somebody
<BR>
else should run around Compaq getting the hardware together to try it out
<BR>
for you? Give me a break.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I can't speak for inside
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Compaq/DEC but I know I can't just find 512MB DIMMs lying around the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; office....even today.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I thought there is a difference between average &quot;office&quot; and Compaq Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; development team.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, my &quot;average office&quot; is API NetWorks....the other company that builds
<BR>
and sells Alphas.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Do you think that memory companies just send us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; truck loads of memory for free?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No. I think that Compaq is in business of *engineering* computers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and if there isn't a single 512MB dimm available to play with. If they don't,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I surely feel sorry for the guys who have to work in such a poor place.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To make clear, I definitely wasn't talking about a secretarisse's office.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again you need to think about the frame when the SX was designed/tested.
