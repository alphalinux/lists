<P>
Dear Alpha Linux Users,
<BR>
<P>I have several Compaq XP-1000 workstations which I use for computationally
<BR>
intensive scientific calculations, which involve large amounts of memory
<BR>
and disk space.  Recently, after encountering substantial I/O performance
<BR>
problems on my systems, I ran a series of I/O tests to examine SCSI disk
<BR>
performance and found what appear to be host adapter/disk negotiation
<BR>
problems on boot-up.  I'm bringing this to the attention of the members of
<BR>
this list in order to get some feedback or perhaps to bring the problem
<BR>
to the attention of those who can come up with more elegant fixes than
<BR>
my workarounds.
<BR>
<P>On each of my workstations I have three 18 GB Ultra 160 SCSI disks, but,
<BR>
unfortunately the on-board host adapter is a Qlogic ISP1020 Ultra Wide SCSI
<BR>
that is capable of only 40 MB/s transfer rates.  I wrote a little test
<BR>
program to simply write a 2.4 GB file to disk, including the appropriate
<BR>
fdatasync() to isolate hardware problems from buffering.  My timing with
<BR>
the ISP1020 controller: a whopping 9 MB/s sustained transfer rate.
<BR>
<P>So, I ordered a Symbios Ultra2 SCSI controller which can get 80 MB/s just
<BR>
to see the speed difference.  I connected my scratch drives to the new
<BR>
controller and things improved substantially --- but still I could get
<BR>
only 34 MB/s.  I examined the logs carefully and found that the Symbios
<BR>
adapter and the disks were negotiating only a 40 MB/s transfer rate!  A good
<BR>
friend suggested that maybe the host adapter was trying to negotiate with
<BR>
the disks before they'd completely spun up.  So, I recompiled my kernel
<BR>
(2.4.1) to use the Symbios driver (sym53c8xx) as a module.  I then rebooted,
<BR>
inserted the Symbios module, and, as expected, the disks returned only 34
<BR>
MB/s transfer.  I then rmmod the driver and reinserted it immediately with
<BR>
no reboot so that the disks wouldn't spin down.  The host negaotiated an
<BR>
80 MB/s transfer rate with the disks (according to the logs) and my I/O
<BR>
test program reported a 74 MB/s transfer rate.  Amazing.
<BR>
<P>As a final test of this little phenomenon, I went to another of my XP-1000's
<BR>
with the pitiful Qlogic ISP1020 card.  On initial cold boot, I get the
<BR>
expected 9 MB/s transfer rate.  If I simply warm boot the machine and
<BR>
immediately re-run my I/O test, I get 16-17 MB/s.  This is better, but
<BR>
still less than half what the Qlogic card should be capable of.  I then
<BR>
looked through the qlogicisp.c driver code in the 2.4.2 kernel and played
<BR>
with default settings.  I found that if I recompiled the code to grab its
<BR>
defaults from the card's NVRAM, then I could get a 34 MB/s transfer rate
<BR>
out of the Qlogic card, but if I used the compiled-in defaults, I could
<BR>
get 17 MB/s at best.
<BR>
<P>In summary:
<BR>
<P>(1) It seems likely that the initial negotiation between the host adapater
<BR>
(both the Qlogic and Symbios cards) and the disks has problems, and that
<BR>
performance is greatly improved (doubled, in fact) simply by rebooting the
<BR>
machine.  This occurs with both Qlogic ISP1020 and Symbios host adapters
<BR>
with my Compaq Ultra 160 drives.
<BR>
<P>(2) The defaults for the Qlogic ISP1020 host adapter (which appears to be
<BR>
standard on the XP-1000 motherboard) would seem to result in only 20 MB/s
<BR>
transfers rather than the expected 40 MB/s with that Ultra Wide card.
<BR>
<P>Any comments you might have on these phenomena would be greatly
<BR>
appreciated.
<BR>
