<EM>&gt; Of course I checked prices -- with TechData, a major distributor.  Congrats with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; finding DLT media for $54 -- that's a great deal, and yes that's cheaper than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ecrix media,  but note that the DLT7000 is around $1000 more to purchase.
</EM><BR>
<P>And for my use, 67% faster. You pay to get performance as usual.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Ampex now have quad-density that allows 660GB per cartridge.  You seem to take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; great delight in pointing out the most minor of mistakes, so please allow me to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; return the favor:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What school of math are you using ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DLT IV cart = 40GB native capacity (only with DLT8000) = $54
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; $54 / 40GB  =  $1.35/GB
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; LTO = 100GB native = $131 (per pricewatch)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; $131 / 100 = $1.31/GB
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Seems to me that $1.31/GB &lt; $1.35, maybe you just like to pay more per GB.  If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use the more common DLT4000 or DLT7000, the $/GB figures for DLT are much worse.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I like real references. I don't like fuzzy numbers and non-confirmed
<BR>
information. Apparently Techdata is a wholesale outfit according to 
<BR>
their web site so normal folks can't confirm your price quote.
<BR>
<P>Where is that new Ampex drive described on a public web site? The Ampexdata
<BR>
site seems to ignore it. I'd like to read about.
<BR>
<P>No different school, just different timeframe. Should have looked at 
<BR>
the latest LTO prices, they've dropped.
<BR>
<P>If you trust the sellers on ebay, new DLT IV carts go for around $40 
<BR>
there, used around $20. That would be $40/40GB=$1.00/GB, $40/35GB=$1.14/GB. 
<BR>
Used, divide by two. One of the advantages of mainstream equipment is 
<BR>
they generate a secondary market as new generations arrive on the 
<BR>
scene and companies upgrade.
<BR>
<P>If it were me, I'd buy a used DLT7000 and tapes off ebay.
<BR>
If you're uncomfortable with used equipment, you'd probably make
<BR>
a different decision. Most of the people I've dealt with on ebay
<BR>
are on the up and up. There are some that aren't though or they're
<BR>
totally clueless about the HW they're selling.
<BR>
<P>As Maurice said, VXA-1 is not near either DLT or LTO for media
<BR>
cost. Even at your cost, it's $65/33GB=$1.97/GB.
<BR>
<P>Really, a used 5GB 8mm is a bargain for storage if you can tolerate
<BR>
around 0.5-1.0 MB/sec. transfer. As above, $3/5GB=$0.60/GB. If you can 
<BR>
use them, a CD-R is better, $0.20/650MB=$0.31/GB. If speed is 
<BR>
important, which should be less so on a home system, then consider
<BR>
paying more for the drive. If you're comfortable with used equipment,
<BR>
look on the auction sites and you can find some real bargains.
