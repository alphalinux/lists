<EM>&gt; Yes, because after all the engineering directly get the cash from the sale
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm sure.
</EM><BR>
<P>You have a point here of course. But to insist that sales are totally
<BR>
irrelevant seems a bit overkill to me, that's all.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, but how many SXs do you think they have sitting in Compaq? and you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think that just because you ask a question on this list, Jay or somebody
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; else should run around Compaq getting the hardware together to try it out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for you? Give me a break.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I did not imply that, of course. I was very surprised that with a given
<BR>
amount of 21164s around nobody cared to check this issue, that's all.
<BR>
512MB stick didn't come out yesterday.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, my &quot;average office&quot; is API NetWorks....the other company that builds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and sells Alphas.
</EM><BR>
<P>I know. If the applications you're dealing with do not need that much of memory,
<BR>
you're in luck, trust me. All vendors seem to bypass 2-4CPU/8-16GB
<BR>
configurations altogether, and your statement just confirms it once again.
<BR>
This leaves many folks doing physics-related computations behind. I'm not
<BR>
the only one around doing this kind of work, believe me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; To make clear, I definitely wasn't talking about a secretarisse's office.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again you need to think about the frame when the SX was designed/tested.
</EM><BR>
<P>Several folks stated that 21164 is too old. I do see their point.
<BR>
However, everybody knows price of a single 21264. This will keep
<BR>
21164s as a primary home Alpha around for some years to come,
<BR>
I believe, especially giving any lack of prospects of affordable 21264s.
<BR>
<P>If I understood it correctly, Jay hinted that the required work can be
<BR>
done, it requires playing around with SROM code. If there is anyone
<BR>
capable to do this work, I'd happily lend the sticks. Sorry I can't pay
<BR>
for this work from personal money.
