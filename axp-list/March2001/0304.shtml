<P>
Sorry for the OT, but I am really stumped on this one.  I was attempting
<BR>
to back up a win95 FAT32 partition by doing a 'tar -cvf' on it and storing
<BR>
the tar file on another disk.  I had some problems as the tar file would
<BR>
exceed 2GB and then tar would die telling me that the archive was too big
<BR>
to continue (even though there was 15GB still available on the device
<BR>
where the archive was being written).  [I figure that the 2GB things was
<BR>
due to the fact that it was a 2.2.14 kernel that must not have supported a
<BR>
file size above 2GB. This seems less important right now.]
<BR>
Some how the cluster size on the FAT32 parition got changed to 0.  The
<BR>
partition is still intact.  I haven't changed the parition type, formated,
<BR>
reformated or any of the above. Nothing has been written to the partition
<BR>
and the parition itself still shows to be intact.  I can even boot from
<BR>
the drive (using lilo on the MBR) as long as I don't boot from that
<BR>
parition (partition 1, on my machine /dev/hda1 occupying sec 1-511).
<BR>
Roughly a 4GB partition.
<BR>
<P>How do I get the cluster size set back to what it was (the standard
<BR>
win95 FAT32 size) or alternatively, get the data off of that partition.  I
<BR>
haven't had any luck attempting to mount it under linux.  I have tried
<BR>
dosfsck, fsck.vfat/fsck.msdos, partition magic 4.0, revival, PQDI, Norton
<BR>
Disk Doctor (old Dos version).  I haven't allowed anything to write to the
<BR>
disk.  I have only attempted reads.  The data is important or I would just
<BR>
back up the rest of the disk and repartition it.
<BR>
<P>Has anyone come across this before?  Any ideas?
<BR>
<P>Mount returns:
<BR>
fatfs:bogus cluster size
<BR>
VFS: Can't find a valid MSDOS filesystem on dev 03:01.
<BR>
<P>dosfsck returns:
<BR>
dosfsck 2.2, 06JUL1999, FAT32, LFN
<BR>
Logical sector size is zero.
<BR>
<P>I realize that this is way off topic.  Any help or even where to look
<BR>
would be appreciated.  I am really out on a limb on this one.
<BR>
<P>Big Thanks in Advance to anyone and everyone.
<BR>
