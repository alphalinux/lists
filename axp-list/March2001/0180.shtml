<P>
Their is no palcode in ARC for NT, the code (Pal and Hal) was supplied to
<BR>
usoft to be included in the NT installation CD and placed in the boot
<BR>
partition of the disk. We supplied updates on floppy which you would feed
<BR>
into NT as part of the Install for new systems released between service
<BR>
packs. 
<BR>
<P>We also had update floppies for distributing enhancements..  :^)

<EM>&gt; One would guess that Linus' and/or DEC's original port may have attempted

</EM><BR>
<P>I don't believe so.  Linus had SRM because he did his early development
<BR>
on OSF/1, before Alpha/Linux became self-hosting.  As a nice
<BR>
side-effect, Linux and OSF/1 (now Tru64) became compatible at the system
<BR>
call layer.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Since SRM was being sold
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seperately back then, MILO may have been a stopgap measure so people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; did not have to pay extra to run a (semi-)free OS.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  MILO was created to offer a free bootloader for Linux.  It was
<BR>
also a bit smaller than SRM, which with typical memory sizes in 1995 was
<BR>
a plus.
<BR>
<P>Incidentally, much of this history is documented in LJ's archives.  For
<BR>
example, see &quot;The Miniloader&quot; in
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www2.linuxjournal.com/lj-issues/issue20/1178.html.">http://www2.linuxjournal.com/lj-issues/issue20/1178.html.</A>
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Could also be ARC was centered around a certain 32-bit OS and did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not &quot;fully&quot; support 64-bitness?
</EM><BR>
<P>I have been told that ARC PALcode is completely unsuited to Linux, but
<BR>
cannot substantiate that claim.
<BR>
<P>Putting PALcode in the kernel is an interesting idea, but kind of
<BR>
defeats the purpose of a &quot;generic&quot; kernel.  (Remember the days when RH
<BR>
distributed a separate kernel image for each board?)
