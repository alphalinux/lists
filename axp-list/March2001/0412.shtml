</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's a little much....you make the assumption that these engineering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have unlimited acess to more hardware than they know what to do with.
</EM><BR>
<P>Two 512MB dimms isn't equal to &quot;more hardware than Compaq
<BR>
Alpha engineers know what to do with&quot; in my books, that's all.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you know what 512MB DIMMs cost today
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes. Nearly nil comparing to anything related with high-performance
<BR>
computing (again, in my books).
<BR>
<P>Have you ever approached Compaq to buy even nowadays-lowly (imho)
<BR>
DS20 for University and hear the price they are selling it at ?
<BR>
Why do I need to think that the guys who are getting such money
<BR>
for their computers can't afford 2 sticks at around 1000$ ?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and more importantly what they would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have cost when the SX was being developed?
</EM><BR>
<P>Note that I wasn't talking about times when SX was developed.
<BR>
This discussion is taking place this week, and there was plently
<BR>
of time to check that since than. As Jay asked *me* if I checked
<BR>
it myself I surely felt uncertain if it has been ever done.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I can't speak for inside
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Compaq/DEC but I know I can't just find 512MB DIMMs lying around the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; office....even today.
</EM><BR>
<P>I thought there is a difference between average &quot;office&quot; and Compaq Alpha
<BR>
development team.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Do you think that memory companies just send us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; truck loads of memory for free?
</EM><BR>
<P>No. I think that Compaq is in business of *engineering* computers,
<BR>
and if there isn't a single 512MB dimm available to play with. If they don't,
<BR>
I surely feel sorry for the guys who have to work in such a poor place.
<BR>
<P>To make clear, I definitely wasn't talking about a secretarisse's office.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm sure plenty of people thought of it....but there's a big difference
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; between thinking about it, and finding the hardware to do it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes I agree. It just was mine mistake to think that Compaq Alpha
<BR>
engineers have some quantity of modern hardware to work with.
<BR>
If they don't have any, I apologize very much, my mistake, sorry.
<BR>
