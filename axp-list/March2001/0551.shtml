<EM>&gt; Now that my UP2000 is humming along pretty well for the most part, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; started to run some benchmarks on it.  The CPU benchmark that we use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most often is running FFTs.  More specifically, we use the FFTW package
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from MIT.  It seems to run quite well on all platforms, except on this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha system.  We've tried building it with both GCC and CCC, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; results were similar; the FFTs run at about the same rate as on a Sun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Blade 1000 (750 MHz).  If one were to compare SPEC results between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these two systems, one might expect the Alpha (833 MHz) to be almost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 100% faster than the UltraSPARC-III.  So the problem must be in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; code generated by the compilers; perhaps they simply are not very well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; optimized (either CCC or GCC).  Are there any special flags (besides
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; -fast) that will generate better code?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'll try CXML next.

<P>Eugene,
<BR>
<P>I am a computational quantum chemist at Virginia Tech and also have several
<BR>
alphas (XP-1000's in my case).  When I first purchased the workstations,
<BR>
their performance under alpha/Linux was very poor (i.e. a factor of
<BR>
four-eight slower) relative to the same hardware running Tru64.  I have
<BR>
spent a great deal of time optimizing their performance, and things are
<BR>
vastly improved.  Now my quantum programs run faster (ca. 33%) on my
<BR>
alpha/Linux workstations than their Tru64 counterparts.  My codes are
<BR>
likely rather different from yours --- I do mostly multiplication of very
<BR>
large matrices, data sorts, and lots of I/O as opposed to FFT's --- so my
<BR>
optimization efforts may not help you at all.
<BR>
<P>Two questions:
<BR>
<P>(1) What memory block sizes does your code require?  I.e., how large are
<BR>
your malloc() calls and how many of them are there?
<BR>
<P>(2) What kernel are you running and from what distribution?
<BR>
<P>-Daniel
<BR>
<P>P.S. None of my optimization improvements came from compiler flags,
<BR>
but instead from OS tweaking.
<BR>
