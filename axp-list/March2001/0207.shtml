<EM>&gt; &gt; I believe that's due to Linux not supporting certain kernel functions

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Right.  The point I didn't make is that Linus really only implemented
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the syscalls he needed to get a self-hosting system, and Linux/OSF
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; syscalls have probably diverged since anyway.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not really, AFAIK.  You can look into kernel sources and see for
<BR>
yourself.  Over time more of syscalls from Tru64 got their emulation in
<BR>
Linux kernel but it is true that not all of them.  In some situations it
<BR>
may be not even clear what their interpretation should be.  Luckily a
<BR>
number of these can often be simply ignored.  If you will see in your
<BR>
logs &quot;&lt;sc, ...&quot; with a bunch of numbers this is a recorded such ignored
<BR>
system call.  But indeed not every Tru64 binary will run under Linux;
<BR>
generally you will miss required libraries and not system calls.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You can bet that Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also has syscalls that Tru64 does not.
</EM><BR>
<P>So?  Missing calls the other way would be important only if you would
<BR>
try to run Linux binaries under Tru64.  I never heard about such
<BR>
attempts.  First Tru64 does not understand an ELF format of &quot;native&quot;
<BR>
Linux binaries, as it is using COFF instead, so further questions are
<BR>
academic.  Nearly always if you are interested you can simply recompile
<BR>
an application in question on Tru64 and that is definitely much simpler.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't use Tru64, but I'd wager that its thread APIs are based on Mach
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tasks, which could be very difficult to emulate (feel free to correct me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here).
</EM><BR>
<P>Some Tru64 programs which, at least nominally, use threads can be
<BR>
satisified with libpthread.so and libpthreads.so which are simply links
<BR>
to /usr/shlib/libc.so as provided by Tru64-compat package.  Quite
<BR>
possible not every one but at least some can be &quot;cheated&quot; that way.
