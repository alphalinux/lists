Well, it looks like there is something very wrong with my system.
<BR>
After a few iterations of creating and deleting large files (1-2GB),
<BR>
the system froze up.
<BR>
<P>To recap, it is a dual 833 MHz Alpha UP2000 system from API, 2 GB of
<BR>
RAM, 9 GB boot disk with 2 GB of swap space, two 73 GB Seagate 173404LW
<BR>
drives in RAID0 configuration, the on board SCSI controller that
<BR>
connects all the drives is listed as Adaptec AHA-2940U2/W.  The system
<BR>
is running RH 7.0, 2.2.14-6.0smp.
<BR>
<P>At one point in the tests, it looked as if the disk drives actually
<BR>
spun down, and when the system tried to access them, they spun back
<BR>
up.  But by the time they came back, the system registered a time out
<BR>
error, and tried to reset the bus.  The disks were still accessible at
<BR>
that point, but response was very slow.  No new errors were being
<BR>
registered.  Eventually the system hung up.  After a reboot, we did a
<BR>
continuous series of file creations, and after several of these, the
<BR>
system hung up again.
<BR>
<P>I'm suspecting that maybe there is a disk driver error.  (Please let me
<BR>
know if I'm wrong.)  Checking the bug fixes for RH 7.0 at redhat.com, I
<BR>
did not see anything specific to disk drivers.  Is there somewhere else
<BR>
I can check?  In the 6.X areas?
