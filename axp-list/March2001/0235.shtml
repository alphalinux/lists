<P>
Sorry, but you've been given bum info.
<BR>
I have 16 years experience of dealing with SCSI, coupled with writing both OS
<BR>
drivers and device firmware.  In all that time I've never come across a device
<BR>
that has failed a FORMAT UNIT command (other than because the unit was on its
<BR>
death bed).  SCSI devices have never had interleaving -- all of that messy
<BR>
business is abstracted by the device itself, all SCSI random-access devices have
<BR>
been LBA since day 1.  This also means that you don't have to concern yourself
<BR>
with the internal geometry of the drive, including whether more data is stored at
<BR>
the outer tracks or not.   The LBA addressing caused problems in the old days
<BR>
since the old INT 13 interface necessitated a C/H/S addressing scheme that was
<BR>
imposed on top of the LBA addressing.  This is still done today at least until the
<BR>
kernel/device drivers are initialized.
<BR>
Most devices do support various block sizes (I don't recall off-hand which
<BR>
commands are used to inquire as to what is supported, but I think it's READ BLOCK
<BR>
LIMITS).  However, if you do successfully format a drive with 1024 or 2048 byte
<BR>
blocks (sectors) don't be surprised if your OS freaks out, as it has to be coded
<BR>
explicitly to deal with that block size.  I'm not sure if linux has any such
<BR>
provisions.
<BR>

<BR>
<P><P>Sorry, but that was the info relayed to me. AND with current technology
<BR>
being what they are, low level formatting, interleav'ng factors, and the
<BR>
different amount of data that can be placed on each track ( more outer,
<BR>
less inner tracks ) I tend to believe the tecnicians answer. Just having
<BR>
the scsi command set have a format command, does not mean that the drive
<BR>
has the capability.
<BR>
<P>My query at the time was to change the sector size from 512 to 1024,
<BR>
which required a low level format. I did not have any luck in getting it
<BR>
to change to 1024. Oh well. 
<BR>
<P>I'd love to see 1024 byte sectors for my scsi drives.

<EM>&gt; The last time I asked about &quot;low level&quot; formatting of a scsi disk drive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is that that disk drive capability does not exist anymore. This ( I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think ) was for a quantum 4 gig disk drive. I think that most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manufacturers of disk drives ( these days ) wont let u low level format
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything.
