<P>
Peter,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I wondered if we are missing the point here. With the introduction of 3G
</EM><BR>
mobile
<BR>
<EM>&gt;devices I wondered if we'll be moving away from the traditional desktop
</EM><BR>
machines
<BR>
<EM>&gt;to something smaller and more portable. 
</EM><BR>
<P>You raise an interesting point, I think there is a lot of validity to this.
<BR>
On the other hand, I don't see desktop systems or servers going away.  The
<BR>
line will probably be drawn in a different place for determining what
<BR>
ultimately justifies having a powerful system that is fettered by its own
<BR>
bulk to wherever it is semi-permanently installed.  Really powerful systems
<BR>
(leave this to your own interpretation of what that will be in 7-10 years)
<BR>
will probably be like something of a &quot;personal server&quot; while the primary
<BR>
computing device will be some combination of portable computer (wearable?).
<BR>
I have doubts that given the current environment if Alpha will see much use
<BR>
in these &quot;portable&quot; roles unless they consistently keep the processor
<BR>
simpler and the die shrinks ahead of the competition (lending nicely to
<BR>
portable use).  The only portable Alpha was the Alphabook 1 from Tadpole
<BR>
(based on the 233MHz 21066A, which was already technically obsolete at the
<BR>
time it was released).  There was a point at which the 21264 was to be
<BR>
adapted to portable/low cost use in the form of the 21264PC, but like the
<BR>
21164PCA, it never appeared after the Digital acquisition by Compaq. 
<BR>
<P>Digital's inspired StrongARM is seeing remarkable success, now in the hands
<BR>
of Intel (with a new generation dubbed Xscale) and will debut at 1GHz before
<BR>
the end of the year yet consume something between 1-3 watts. But this is no
<BR>
Alpha processor, its based on the ARM core.  
<BR>
<P>I see three major issues with the widescale adoption of truly handheld or
<BR>
wearable PCs: 1) interfaces are still fairly crude, including miniaturized
<BR>
displays, speech recognition of commands (you can train them only so far),
<BR>
2) Lack of a broader range of applications (more geared towards
<BR>
organizers/schedules, messaging and simple word processing than say
<BR>
programming, layout or graphics manipulation) 3) Overall price/performance
<BR>
is still less than a desktop machine in most comparisons. 
<BR>
<P>It will still be years before the major issues of system power, battery
<BR>
life, display and speech recognition are resolved.  There is also the issue
<BR>
of having some reduction in privacy of you are having to chatter verbally to
<BR>
your portable/handheld/wearable computer in public.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
Thanks for that interesting perspective Peter.
<BR>
<P>--KE
