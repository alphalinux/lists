<EM>&gt;Instead of having a freeware console that can bootstrap all platforms &gt;including VMS and Tru64. Why not give this new firmware the ability to load &gt;SRM from say a hard disk into memory from this &quot;console&quot;. You could then &gt;boot VMS &amp; Tru64 from there without having to modify your flash everytime. &gt;VMS &amp; Tru64 don't really benefit from a console with more hardware support &gt;seeing that whats supported in their respective kernels doesnt extend mostly &gt;beyond what compaq sells with those systems.

In other words do it exactly reverse of now.  I do not see this happening and wearing my business hat, If I spend a bundle on a Tru64 or VMS system I would not appreciate jumping hurdles to boot.  
<BR>
<P>Currently, you can use SRM to load a secondary bootloader, such as aboot or even MILO.  Jumping hurdles to boot a free (either way) O/S such as alphalinux, I do not mind.  I really prefer SRM-aboot, although if SRM could be taught a little about ext2-linux so you wouldn't need a secondary loader that would be better.  Or if the linux community standardized on better filesystem (journaled) than knowledge of that would be better.
<BR>
<P>Most of the complaints about SRM I see are about it not supporting certain hardware.  These fall into three categories: graphics, HBA and network.  Network cards: Most people do not boot from the network so I do not see this as a current crisis.  Most cards are accepted by SRM, and its up to the O/S to deal with these.  Those few of us that do netboot, are aware of this get the cards that SRM can netboot from.  As long as some NICs are netboot functional with SRM, those of us that need this will get these cards.
<BR>
HBAs (host bus adaptors, scsi cards):This is the most critical area IMO to support.  It also covers the largest base of demand IMO.  Without support for a scsi card you can not boot from it.  Although you can get around it in some cases, load a secondary loader from another scsi card which is supported, load a secondary loader from floppy, netboot.
<BR>
Graphics:This is probably the second largest base of demand IMO, although it's also probably the loudest.   A lot of us run headless, or use our systems as servers in which case having anything beyond basic video support is low on our list.  However, more and more seem to be using their alphas as workstations, which generally benefit from good graphics support.

<P>I have probably rambled too much.
