<P>
With regards to your message at 05:08 PM 4/6/01, KirkE@paccessglobal.com. 
<BR>
Where you stated:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Greg,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;API already has the UP1100, which uses AMD's chipset. I haven't asked,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;but one would presume that they will continue to have a low-end
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;machine using the least expensive motherboard possible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I have been informed that UP1100 is EOL.  As is the older SlotB based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;UP1000.  At this point, only the Samsung product (not an API product) with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;name dangerously similar to those built and sold by APIis slated to have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;AMD Iron Gate G4 (761), dubiously named the UP1500. Samsung has some info on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their site about it, though it is still under &quot;development.&quot; At first I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thought that the UP1500 would be a fairly innovative offering to provide the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Alpha platform community with an &quot;enthusiast&quot;/ entry level programmer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;workstation or web appliance.  On closer inspection however, it looks like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it has retained the rather unusual UP1100 non-standard ATX arrangement, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;detail pointed out to me by a colleague.  This isn't much of a problem in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;desk side workstation I should think, but would probably pose a problem in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sourcing rack mount chassis that would fit without obscuring slots, drives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or memory banks.
</EM><BR>
Actually the case is NOT an issue.
<BR>
Yes, the PCI slots are offset from the default ATX locations, but the cost 
<BR>
of 2U cases for this is not exorbitant. For example our company provides a 
<BR>
2U with 400W power, 3 slot PCI riser, full extension slides, hotswap fans, 
<BR>
2 x 5.25&quot; bays, etc. for $325.
<BR>
And VERY few Alphas have ever fit into a &quot;standard&quot; case, so this is 
<BR>
nothing new..
<BR>
The real issue will be wether or not API will be able to deliver in N. America.
<BR>
For example the UP1100 has been available here in only the 600MHz version, 
<BR>
whereas Samsung has also been selling the UP1100 in a 700MHz overseas.
<BR>
Considering the memory bandwidth limitations of the 1100, the extra &quot;oomph&quot; 
<BR>
of the faster processor was/is important. With the new DDR based UP1500 I 
<BR>
think it will be a VERY nice machine!
<BR>
The only deadlock we see is if there will be enough supply of DDR cache RAM 
<BR>
for these to be built.. Try buying a DDR Alpha CPU module nowadays..
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Sun has managed to produce some excellent low-cost systems that are selling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like hotcakes.  The added benefit is that exposure and access ultimately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;leads to increased acceptance and a larger user base, along with the obvious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;benefit of more software (and often better software). The Sun Blade 100, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Netra X1 AC200 and the new line of SPARCEngine motherboards including the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;AXi and the AXe are making it easier and cheaper to buy, build or OEM an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ultra SPARC II based system (and soon enough, Ultra III). I bought an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;SPARCEngine AXi with a 360MHz UIIi CPU and 256MB of RAM from NU Horizons for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;little more than $700.00.  An Ultra 30 coming off of lease soon followed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It's now possible to obtain a 500 MHz IIe system like the Netra X1 or the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sun Blade 100 for less than $1,000, but there is absolutely nothing similar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the Alpha arsenal.
</EM><BR>
The only new and interesting lower end Sun board is the AXI1105 and the Blade.
<BR>
And they are not without teething issues. I know, as I have an 1105 here. 
<BR>
It is a nice design, but it is still not &quot;ready for prime time&quot;. For 
<BR>
example the keyboard and mouse ports do not work yet! Sun assures me that a 
<BR>
new ROM BIOS revision will fix that &quot;real soon now&quot;. It also requires a 
<BR>
&quot;special&quot; version of Solaris 8. And Linux does not run on it yet.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Having broached the question more than once for a quote from most of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;vendors still selling Alpha solutions, obtaining a 4.5 year old 164LX
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;motherboard with a 533 or 600MHz EV56 CPU is usually about a $900 to $1200
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;proposition, and that's before integrating an actual system together.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Having gone this route in the past, I'm inclined to suggest to obtaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;systems that are already fully integrated and guaranteed fully functional.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I obtained my last Alpha through Ebay auctions and scored a PWS 600au with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;512MB memory and an 18GB drive for under $1,000 (not the going rate, even a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;year later).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;At current, the only practical, low cost option for Alpha platform
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enthusiasts (ranging from the stalwart OpenVMS crowd/DECUS groups, the BSD
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;camp, the living-dead of the Alpha/NT camp and the Alpha/Linux camp),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;students or programmers is for obtaining out of date hardware through the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;auction sites or calling up leasing companies that occasionally give up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Digital branded workstations and servers for a song. It could be said there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is no Alpha workstation market anymore, but what are all those clustered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Alpha systems that are filling the computing media being programmed on? How
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;many people on this list would be willing to part with $1,500 or so to be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fully integrated &quot;Sun Blade&quot; style Alpha, just to keep their stake in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;platform, write some code and keep their platform specific skills up? If it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;could run OpenVMS and Tru64, there would be an automatic market in the DECUS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;crowd and plenty of shops with an OpenVMS and Tru64 investment would snap
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them up. Linux users would love them as they would be price competitive with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Athlon Thunderbirds on the X86 front. Whatever replaces the UP1x00 needs to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;address these issues, its been so long since a cost-effective solution worth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;buying has come out, they'd be all the rage.  There would be dozens of ways
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to promote such a system.  Sun is proof enough it can be done (remember that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;an old Ultra II based system like the Ultra Enterprise 450 workgroup
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;server/workstation still fetches some $20,000 for the base unit and another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;$2800 per 450MHz CPU).
</EM><BR>
<P>A good bet for low cost is the Compaq XP1000 units. The older 500MHz 
<BR>
version is available for under $6000. Good memory bandwidth, nice design.
<BR>
At $13000+ the 667 they still sell is vastly overpriced. But the clear-out 
<BR>
500's are a good deal.
<BR>
<P>I agree that there is some level of &quot;ball dropping&quot; in the Alpha low cost 
<BR>
camp, and we need to look no further than the fact that it WILL get better. 
<BR>
Now is just a lousy time if you want both the latest and a cheap price..
