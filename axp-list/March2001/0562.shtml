<P>
Tom,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Ummm...not quite. API's Linux in ROM is not based on the OpenBIOS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;project.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Is the project entirely in-house, or did you outsource some of the work?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;And what in the world does that have to do with the price of tea?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As with all projects we use whatever mix of in-house and outsourced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;talent we feel is appropriate for the requirements.  And no, we don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disclose this &lt;snip&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I was only curious, I wouldn't be so bold as to ask with whom you were (or
<BR>
were not) working with on any of your projects.  I've already been
<BR>
appropriately scolded for such probings.
<BR>
<P>-KE
