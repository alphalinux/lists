Hello everybody,
<BR>
For quite a while now I have problems with my alpha-PC164 running RH6.2. From 
<BR>
time to time, the machine locks himself up completly, no ping-reply anymore, 
<BR>
just a hard reset helps.
<BR>
&nbsp;In search of a problem I did nearly everything that came to my mind: Stock 
<BR>
RH6.2 distribution with original kernel, recompile 2.4.0, 2.4.1, 2.4.2 
<BR>
kernel, ripping out every card I have in my computer (S3-video, SCSI Adaptech 
<BR>
AH29xxx, SBlaster, Network-card).
<BR>
&nbsp;After a while I found that everytime I copied large amounts of data from the 
<BR>
network to my HD (SCSI or IDE, no matter), the computer hangs. So, if I copy
<BR>
cp /mnt/nfs/redhat-7.0-disc1.iso /var/tmp
<BR>
and do a
<BR>
ls -R /
<BR>
at the same time, usually after 2-5 secs, the computer hangs. Under X it 
<BR>
takes a bit longer. Changing the network-card from NE2000-PCI to NE2000-ISA 
<BR>
and a 3Com PCI-card didn't change anything. (all 10MB-cards)
<BR>
&nbsp;The same thing goes for NFS, SAMBA and FTP. Every time there is a heavy 
<BR>
net-traffic, the computer hangs completly.
<BR>
&nbsp;It only got a little bit better after having compiled the NFS and SAMBA 
<BR>
directly into the kernel, instead of having them as modules (it helped with 
<BR>
sound, though ;-) Instead of hanging after 5MByte, it hung after 200MByte. 
<BR>
Still not enough for a redhat-iso!
<BR>
&nbsp;This only crashes if I copy it from my local server (an i386 with Linux 
<BR>
2.4.1 or something. Long time I didn't touch it anymore ;-) Copying from the 
<BR>
web over my cable at 50KBytes/s is no problem...
<BR>
&nbsp;Reading through the archives, I found the tip to enable PCI-QUIRKS in the 
<BR>
kernel. But as 2.4.2 doesn't have PCI-QUIRKS anymore (or am I blind?), I 
<BR>
wonder what shall I do?
<BR>
<P>Thanx in advance if someone is able to help me,
<BR>

<P>PS: And this is Linus GASSER, not THORVALDS. Just in case you wonder...
