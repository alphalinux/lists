</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Because the source for MILO is generaly available and it is based on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; linux kernel, new drivers can be added reasonably easly. For the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reason bugs can be fixed when they crop up.
</EM><BR>
<P>The source is available yes, and several people continue to work on
<BR>
it. However, the x86 emulator included with it is binary only and guessing
<BR>
from its age, will do no better than older SRMs with newer video cards
<BR>
etc....I suppose if somebody wanted to they may be able to use the x86
<BR>
emulator that the XFree86 guys use, but I'd imagine this to be a major
<BR>
undertaking.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; MILO has some problems with setting up some motherboards. The usual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; answer I get to questions about MILO are &quot;well just use SRM it is there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and works&quot;.  I think this discussion is evidence that althought SRM is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there it does not allways work.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Would it not be worth the while of the Alpha community to try and find a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; single boot loader and get it working with all the various motherboards.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Somthing that the community as a whole can support. Right now there are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at least 4 different loaders with various levels of support.
</EM><BR>
<P>Also there's no EV6 support in MILO, so that would have to be added, and I
<BR>
think MILOs only value in this case is when it could be flashed into the
<BR>
ROM, replacing AlphaBIOS/SRM. If you're just starting it from ARC then I
<BR>
really don't see any advantage.
