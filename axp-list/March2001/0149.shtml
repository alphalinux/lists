<EM>&gt; &gt; It still strikes me that the obvious answer is to petition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Compaq to Open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Source the SRM code. What on earth harm can it do to them? Sure it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; proprietary, and it is also quite useless for anything BUT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; booting an Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If Compaq means what it says about supporting Open Source and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Linux it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; strikes me that this is the perfect opportunity for them to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; prove the point.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I really can't see re-inventing the wheel as the answer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; But maybe that's just my flawed thinking..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         Yup, your thinking is flawed Maurice. :) Open Sourcing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         SRM doesn't buy you much. You don't want to go there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         Linux booting Linux, I think, makes alot more sense. A
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         Linux kernel booting directly out of flash offers you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         ALOT more flexiblity than dealing with the nuances of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         building SRM. Linux booting Linux is not reinventing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         wheel. Quite the opposite.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         We'll (API) have more to talk about regarding this in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         the not too distant future.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>So Mike, does this address booting Tru64 and VMS on the same system?  I
<BR>
know this is a Linux list, but not thinking of the big picure makes very
<BR>
little sense when talking about something like this.  Everyone wants one
<BR>
bootloader for all their Alpha systems that supports all the gadgets they
<BR>
want it to.  Are you saying that API has a version of Linux to flash into
<BR>
the SROM that will be able to boot Linux, Tru64, VMS, and *BSD?  If not,
<BR>
that just makes things more of a mess than they already are.
<BR>
<P>Don't get me wrong - I think Linux as a boot loader could be an admirable
<BR>
goal, but only if it's taken to its fullest extreme and can be used for
<BR>
all Alphas and all OSes that could be booted on them.  Otherwise it's a
<BR>
source of confusion and even more widely dispersed engineering effort and
<BR>
a new source of interesting bugs.  I'd love a Linux in SROM that can boot
<BR>
everything from the Multia down the hall to the 256P EV7 systems that
<BR>
we'll be building, and boot Linux, Tru64, VMS and *BSD.  _That_ would be
<BR>
cool - _if_ it doesn't cost too much in terms of performance vs. the SRM
<BR>
that has been hand-tweaked for years here.  Like I said, I like the idea,
<BR>
I just want it to work &quot;big picture&quot;, rather than be a point solution.
<BR>
MHO...
