<P>
PWS's which shipped in Nov-Dec 97, did not have SRM, This was because
<BR>
testing was not completed yet for the SRM/Unix version of the product.
<BR>
However when the updated firmware was available in very-early 98/very-late
<BR>
97, all PWS's could receive the update and have both consoles present.  The
<BR>
only difference between the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;au&quot; are the options offered. an &quot;a&quot;
<BR>
could be ordered with options only supported by NT.  an &quot;au&quot; could be
<BR>
ordered only with options that would run on all three OS's (NT, Unix and
<BR>
VMS)

<P><P><EM>&gt;That must have been REAL early, since my 500a is an early
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;model (mine has the Intel instead of the Cypress chipset).
