<P>
Kirk,
<BR>
<P>Thanks a lot for writing this up !
<BR>
I was going to discuss this point exactly - and exactly using the same example,
<BR>
a HUGE difference in current policies between Sun and Alpha. We aren't
<BR>
even mentioning x86 any more here, are we ?
<BR>
Still huge prices for 21164s, Ebay ways for Alphas etc etc etc - everything
<BR>
is the same here.
<BR>
And for Europe the situation is even worse, even after auctions people here
<BR>
have to pay quite a lot for shipping from the USA - the amount of Alphas for
<BR>
sale in Europe is an order of magnitude smaller.
<BR>
<P>There are no entry points for Alpha at the moment, just nothing.
<BR>
<P>I heard already opinion that Sun is selling 100 and 1000s Blades at loss.
<BR>
Fine. It just shows that they are concerned with their marker share, and
<BR>
**mind** market share too.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, I got the feeling that Compaq keep all below $3000 prices
<BR>
for its x86 servers, so nothing is going to happen from Compaq site.
<BR>
What's up with positions of API and Samsung I have no idea :-(
<BR>
<P>Thanks a lot again !
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
<P>Andrei
