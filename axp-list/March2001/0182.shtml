Hi all!
<BR>
<P>A quick question since I didn't find a suitable
<BR>
response on the tru64-managers, debian-alpha or
<BR>
axp-list...
<BR>
<P>I'm attempting to install a _second_ Elsa Gloria
<BR>
Synergy8 (Powerstorm 4D10T) into a Digital Personal
<BR>
Workstation 600au that has both Tru64 5.0 and Debian
<BR>
2.2 installed.
<BR>
<P>I've noted in previous messages that the VGA BIOS must
<BR>
be disabled on one of the cards and that placement
<BR>
about the PCI-PCI bridge is important as well.
<BR>
<P>I've tried the following combinations with attendent
<BR>
results:
<BR>
<P>#1
<BR>
4d10t 	#1	PCI 1	secondary	VGA
<BR>
4d10t 	#2	PCI 2	secondary	VGA disabled
<BR>
1040B		PCI 3	secondary
<BR>
<P>Tru64 doesn't complain (though I had not yet rebuilt
<BR>
the kernel so I just have a console), but Debian gives
<BR>
plenty of PYXIS machine checks!  X(Free86-3.36) under
<BR>
Debian still works on the primary display though...
<BR>
<P>#2
<BR>
4d10t 	#2	PCI 1	secondary	VGA disabled
<BR>
4d10t 	#1	PCI 4	primary		VGA 
<BR>
1040B		PCI 3	secondary
<BR>
<P>SRM complains about an 'illegal device' in PCI slot 4.
<BR>
<P>#3
<BR>
4d10t 	#2	PCI 5	primary		VGA disabled
<BR>
4d10t 	#1	PCI 4	primary		VGA 
<BR>
1040B		PCI 3	secondary
<BR>
<P>SRM again complains about an 'illegal device' in PCI
<BR>
slot 4.
<BR>
<P>#4
<BR>
4d10t 	#2	PCI 2	secondary	VGA disabled
<BR>
4d10t 	#1	PCI 4	primary		VGA 
<BR>
1040B		PCI 3	secondary
<BR>
<P>Same SRM message regarding an 'illegal device' in PCI
<BR>
slot 4.
<BR>
<P>I tried the above config, but swapped the VGA BIOS
<BR>
setting on both cards and still received the same
<BR>
message...:-(
<BR>
<P>Now before I go about swapping cards again, has anyone
<BR>
done this successfully on a Miata with the 4D10T's? 
<BR>
And further, has anyone got this working under both
<BR>
Tru64 and Linux?
<BR>
<P>Is the SCSI adapter (QLA1040B) supposed to be on the
<BR>
primary or secondary PCI bus?
<BR>
<P>I notice that this isn't covered in the unit's
<BR>
documentation:(
<BR>
<P>Any response would be appreciated!  Thanks,
<BR>
<P>sousa.
