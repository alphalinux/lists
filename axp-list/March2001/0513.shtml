<P>
Greetings all,
<BR>
<P>I mentioned what I think is the collective desire for an affordable Alpha
<BR>
system in a previous post.  Lets go one step further with this by actually
<BR>
coming up with a list of system requirements, capabilities and ultimately
<BR>
cost for such a unit.  You can't have it all, so the completed system will
<BR>
have to be an artful compromise.  A low cost Alpha is not in-and-of-itself a
<BR>
real product category, it must be more clearly defined as being an entry
<BR>
point to a larger class of systems with similar architecture, console and
<BR>
operating system support.  The ultimate goal of this task should be to
<BR>
produce a working set of qualities that will make it suitable for use in
<BR>
software development, testing, hardware/OS training and quite hopefully,
<BR>
mind share outside the Alpha enthusiast ranks.  The form factor, level of
<BR>
integration and overall system cost should be similar to that of offerings
<BR>
by other vendors at a similar performance level (Sun Blade, Apple iMac,
<BR>
etc).  The fact that many users of this list, as well as many other Alpha
<BR>
lists as well, own and operate such venerable systems as the Multia (AKA
<BR>
UDB) are evidence of the enduring success of such designs.
<BR>
<P>It's also important to mention that rather than suggesting merely a single
<BR>
platform design, what is needed is an initiative with an ongoing commitment
<BR>
to provide low cost entry points into the Alpha platform that allow system
<BR>
integrators, administrators, developers and students access and experience
<BR>
necessary to sustain the platform and grow the market.  Building one
<BR>
motherboard or system and calling it quits benefits no one. Rather than
<BR>
pointing fingers or leveling blame, I believe there is a real opportunity
<BR>
here to increase &quot;mindshare&quot; and buoy up the platform against such
<BR>
successful competitors at Sun. 
<BR>
<P>The suggested configuration here is just that, a general guideline of
<BR>
capabilities to match the needs and expectations for a larger audience at an
<BR>
under $2,000 price point (with OVMS and Tru64, OS not included. Hobbyists
<BR>
will only need to pay for the media kit in a non-commercial environment).
<BR>
With the case of OpenVMS, finding a working configuration can be tough given
<BR>
its small list of supported video and audio devices. My suggestion is for a
<BR>
system with a lower degree of integration in order to support VMS and Tru64
<BR>
and using plug-in boards for video/network.
<BR>
<P>Enthusiast/Developer/Student (emphasis on Linux):
<BR>
<P>Small footprint ATX deskside chassis
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;space for one internal 3.5&quot; 80GB 7200 RPM ATA-100 drive, 1 combo MKE
<BR>
DVD-RAM/DVD-ROM/CD-ROM.  Optional support could be 	provided for a
<BR>
standard floppy or an MKE 	LS-120 ATA-33 &quot;floptical&quot; drive in a
<BR>
vertical position adjacent to the CD/DVD 	drive. 300 watt ATX power
<BR>
supply
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;700 MHz EV68 or EV69 CPU/4MB DDR HSTL cache in either

non-upgradeable &quot;soldered on&quot; or upgradeable socketted 	configuration 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AMD IG-4 761 chipset (VIA chipset may become a viable option also)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;256MB 184 pin PC266 DDR SDRAM, 4 sockets (2GB max using 512MB
<BR>
unbuffered ECC modules)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nvidia GeForce 3 MPU, AGP 4x (integrated as a soldered on AGP

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integrated USB, IrDA wireless, parallel, dual 9 pin serial, PS/2
<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integrated PC97 accelerated audio (also via ALi southbridge) for 16
<BR>
bit, 48KHz stereo audio
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integrated dual port TI IEEE 1394c &quot;Firewire&quot; for external devices
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 64 bit PCI slot supporting 66MHz 3.3 volt operation, isolated from
<BR>
internal PCI bus (where the Firewire, ATA-100 and 	Fast Ethernet stem).
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Variant 1: Appliance server (Netra X1 - Alpha style)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Space for second QFP to support Intel 82559 Fast Ethernet could be
<BR>
included for using the system as a server appliance 	in a 2U chassis.
<BR>
Omitted on the board will be the AGP video, system will be managed
<BR>
&quot;headless&quot; through serial ports or 	provide video via the PCI slot. AGP
<BR>
extensions disabled in the SROM/console. System could be bundled with only
<BR>
the 	single internal ATA-100 drive and the MKE LS-120 drive but maintain
<BR>
the Firewire and USB support.  Implement additional 	system management
<BR>
functions, including watchdog timer and thermal controls. Out of Band
<BR>
management and remote reboot 	facilitated through off-the-shelf ASIC. Cost
<BR>
should be only slightly higher than the X1.   
<BR>
<P>Target end-user street price for system of around $$1500-$1700 for 256MB
<BR>
configuration 
<BR>
<P><P>DECUS OpenVMS/Tru64/xBSD Enthusiast/Developer/Student (Variant 2):

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integrated dual port TI IEEE 1394c &quot;Firewire&quot; for external devices
<BR>
(treated as an ordinary SCSI controller)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 64 bit PCI slot supporting 66MHz 3.3 volt operation, isolated from
<BR>
internal PCI bus (where the Firewire, ATA-100 and 	Fast Ethernet stem).
<BR>
PCI slot occupied by IntraServer ITI-6011E (combo 21143 Fast Ethernet and
<BR>
Permedia 3 video/4MB).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this configuration, the same planar board/etch as used in
<BR>
originally proposed system.  Omitted are the QFP/STP for 	integrated
<BR>
components such as Intel 82559 Fast Ethernet (on integrated PCI bus), Nvidia
<BR>
GeForce 3 video (on integrated 	AGP, support disabled in SROM/console), USB
<BR>
(header not implemented), IrDA (header not implemented) and the PCI slot
<BR>
will have to be used by the combo Intraserver video/network controller.
<BR>
<P>Target end-user street price of system for around $1900 for 256MB
<BR>
configuration (assumes higher cost of implementing support for OpenVMS in
<BR>
console and driver development).  While this isn't exactly a dream machine
<BR>
(particularly the video), it beats the Compaq XP900 by a mile.
<BR>
<P>There are of course several technical issues to overcome: Firmware console,
<BR>
SROM and operating system/SRM drivers would have to be written more or less
<BR>
from scratch, to name just a few items. The system described here does bear
<BR>
some (deliberate) resemblance to the UP1500 currently under development at
<BR>
Samsung.  While it won't change the world, if there is enough interest in a
<BR>
similar &quot;low-end workstation&quot; configuration perhaps their is a chance the
<BR>
design will be as successful as Sun Blade has been for Sun. Who knows,
<BR>
produced in sufficient volume, there may be systems like these running GPL
<BR>
code at college campuses for years, giving potential future customers a
<BR>
chance to use an Alpha for the first time.  Every college campus I ever
<BR>
attended had a SPARC lab and often enough an IBM RS/6000 lab as well.  There
<BR>
are still fully functional NEXT labs with ugly NEXT cubes in all directions.
<BR>
When was the last time you've seen an Alpha lab? Low cost systems will have
<BR>
a more profound effect on sales in the long run than a system priced above
<BR>
where most schools are willing to pay.  Its hard for companies (particularly
<BR>
here in the US and Europe) to make plans that entail 5 years goals when only
<BR>
the next quarter really matters. Built rather inexpensively, a further
<BR>
stripped down unit based on a variant of this proposed configuration could
<BR>
be built specifically for universities and practically GIVEN away.  Make a
<BR>
very public game of it and let a few dozen people &quot;win&quot; one.  Media events
<BR>
like this turned Apple around with the often trivialized iMac.  
<BR>
<P>Comments anyone?
