<P><EM>&gt; &gt;On each of my workstations I have three 18 GB Ultra 160 SCSI disks, but,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;unfortunately the on-board host adapter is a Qlogic ISP1020 Ultra Wide SCSI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that is capable of only 40 MB/s transfer rates.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Its actually a QLA 1040B, the 1020 is a Fast-20 HBA (Fast SCSI II wide).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The last number in Qlogic part number denotes the rate of the ASIC.  The QLA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1080 is Ultra 2 (Fast 40) and the QLA 10160 is Ultra 160 (Fast 80).  The QLA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1040B is an SRM compatible boot device, but shouldn't be used for data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; volumes.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is good to know, because I was not aware of this naming convention among
<BR>
the Qlogic adapters.  However, it's bothersome that the card is identified
<BR>
by the Qlogic SCSI driver in the kernel as ISP 1020A.  Either way, of
<BR>
course, the card should still provide a 40 MB/s maximum transfer rate.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I would advise the following:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1) First SCSI controller (1040B) single boot disk (9GB Ultra disks can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had for $80.00 on Pricewatch.com)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2) Second SCSI controller (10160 or 12160, 12160 being dual channel) with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2-4 disks (may be software stripped, if desired).
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.  This is essentially the configuration I have, but with a Symbios
<BR>
Ultra2 for the scratch disks.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I noticed that you had some negotiation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problems with your disks, possibly due to spin up/spin down during
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; negotiation.  Unless you have a good reason to maintain the disk spinup at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boot, disable the feature.
</EM><BR>
<P>Indeed, the negotation problem due to spin-up was the entire point of my
<BR>
original message.  The reason for my post was in part to ascertain why this
<BR>
happens, particularly since I was using the SCSI drivers + host adapter +
<BR>
disks in their default configurations.  I suspect that there may be many
<BR>
alpha Linux users who are obtaining poor SCSI transfer rates from thei disks
<BR>
w/o realizing it, or perhaps realize it, but have no idea what the source
<BR>
of the problem is.  As the very trustworthy Compaq engineer who recommended
<BR>
I post this problem to the axp-list said, &quot;This is very broken behavior.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As for your synthetic load generator program to determine max throughput, be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aware that unless your application writes or reads in sequential fashion,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you will not achieve anywhere NEAR those figures (34-74MBps is based on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; synchronous rates at the highest negotiated frequency and with highly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cacheable sequentially read/written data).
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that max throughput is not reasonable for real expectations.
<BR>
The point of my tests, however, was to find out why the disks were performing
<BR>
at worse than 25% of the max.  Getting a *peak* performance 9 MB/s from
<BR>
a host adapter with a max of 40 MB/s (and disks at 160 MB/s) is obviously
<BR>
unacceptable.  The Compaq engineer agreed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;I wrote a little test program to simply write a 2.4 GB file to disk,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; including the appropriate fdatasync() to isolate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;hardware problems from buffering.  My timing with the ISP1020 controller: a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whopping 9 MB/s sustained transfer rate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As I mentioned, this is a 1040B, NOT a 1020 (two controllers that are VERY
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different and more than 3 years of ASIC development between them).  This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sounds about right for an average sustained throughput for that controller,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at least for reads that cannot be effectively buffered with a single disk.
</EM><BR>
<P>The pathetic 9 MB/s was not an average rate, but a sustained value.
<BR>
I repeat that I *doubled* the measured rate just by rebooting the machine.
<BR>
I then bumped it up to 34 MB/s by a trivial tweaking of the qlogicisp.c
<BR>
driver in the kernel.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;I then looked through the qlogicisp.c driver code in the 2.4.2 kernel and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; played
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;with default settings.  I found that if I recompiled the code to grab its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;defaults from the card's NVRAM, then I could get a 34 MB/s transfer rate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;out of the Qlogic card, but if I used the compiled-in defaults, I could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;get 17 MB/s at best.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not too surprising, many of the SCSI controller drivers I've seen do NOT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reference the NVRAM variables which will not use more of the advanced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; features and a higher frequency bus during or after negotiation.  These
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drivers are compiled for safety, not speed.
</EM><BR>
<P>I find this bothersome, to be frank.  I can understand the need for safety
<BR>
in the driver, but the performance I observed was pitiful.  Since many of
<BR>
us purchase alpha's for fast, fast, fast calculations, this kind of problem
<BR>
strikes me as a serious problem.
