<EM>&gt; Had a look at Rawhide at ftp.redhat.com last night and saw that there is a

<EM>&gt; copy of Koffice for Alpha Linux  last night. Has there been any official
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; announcement about this?

<P>If anyone is interested KDE seems to be actively compiled by RedHat now.  You 
<BR>
can pick it up from the kde ftp site or mirrors.  KDE 2.1 doesn't include 
<BR>
koffice (mainly because koffice is going through some major work right now 
<BR>
with the new rtf widgets for better stability), but koffice from 2.0 or 2.0.1 
<BR>
work just fine.
<BR>
<P>I have RedHat 6.2 rpms of kde 2.0, 2.0.1, and 2.1 on my computer at . . .
<BR>

<BR>
if you want to play with them.
<BR>
<P>Some notes:
<BR>
konqueror needs gcc compiled openssl and openssh to get it working as a web 
<BR>
browser.  I have mine at . . .

<P>You should also disable global javascript and then pick and choose sites that 
<BR>
you want to try it for under the konq settings.  Javascript sites like 
<BR>
abcnews and msnbc will kill konq.  I've found it is kind of hit and miss with 
<BR>
other javascript sites.  For me konq is what makes kde 2.1 my primary 
<BR>
interface instead of gnome or xfce.
<BR>
<P>koffice from kde2.0.1 is good enough for light use.  I wouldn't use kword for 
<BR>
a long paper without hitting [ctl]-s every couple of minutes.  Same with the 
<BR>
other applications.  I type up homework assignments and keep grades right now 
<BR>
without any problems at all, which is good enough for me.  Kspread needs some 
<BR>
more functions and things like quick-fill.
<BR>
<P>kmail works again on AlphaLinux and can set your sig as an application (like 
<BR>
fortune).  It is really nice.
<BR>
<P>For sound you will probably need to turn off arts.  It works (mostly) but not 
<BR>
enough to let it be the primary app that grabs your sound device.  noatun 
<BR>
(the kde media player) is broken again with AlphaLinux kde 2.1 so I'm staying 
<BR>
with mpg123 and gqmpeg for my mp3's.  If noatun looks very promising as an 
<BR>
all around media player, but it isn't near that yet for Alpha.
<BR>
<P>If you like ide's similar to ms studio or the like, you will probably enjoy 
<BR>
kdevelop.  I use vim and a console to type make in (and sometimes fluid for 
<BR>
fltk apps) so I haven't tried kdevelop enough to say if it is any good.
