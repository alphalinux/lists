<P><EM>&gt; Speaking of file system problems, I have one that maybe folks on this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; list can help solve.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I recently got a API UP2000 with two 833 MHz processors and 3 disk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drives.  A 36 GB drive is used as the boot disk running some recent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dist of RH linux.  Two 73 GB drives were RAID 0'd together to form a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very large volume for data storage.  All drives are on the base SCSI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bus on the mother board, which I think is Ultra-II Fast Wide SCSI.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (This was the way it was delivered, and I haven't had a chance to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much with it yet.)  If anyone from API is watching, this is the system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you provided to WSM for me to evaluate.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, the onboard is Ultra 2, 80MB/sec.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I tried to run a simple file I/O test program to check the performance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of RAID 0 on the same bus, as I've heard of some people getting pretty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good results this way.  The program is very simple; it simply creates a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; file, and starts to write a specified buffer size of random data to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; file a specified number of times.  In the standard tests that I run,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the buffer size is 1 MB, mem aligned to 65536 bytes, and I write 1024
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of them to create a 1GB file.  My test brought lots of SCSI errors in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the system log file, and the mounted partition became inaccessible.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was able to dismount it, but remount attempts gave errors complaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of unsupported fs type.  fsck got similar errors.
</EM><BR>
<P>Can you get us the SCSI errors? Also, can we assume that you've got the
<BR>
correct cabling and proper termination?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I tried running the same test on the 36 GB root disk, and managed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complete the run, but only got about 3.3 MB/s transfer rate.  This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seems awefully slow for Ultra-II SCSI.  According to the specs I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seen for most 36 GB disks, they should be able to run between 20-45
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MB/s rates depending on which zone your data happens to have landed,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with average of 30 MB/s.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Right now, the system is down for some reason, and I can't get to it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; until Monday.  In the mean time, can anyone provide any pointers on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disk and RAID setup in Linux?  I am most interested in high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; performance, but also need reliability (who doesn't?).
</EM><BR>
<P>Can you tell us what's installed on it, and which kernel version? I've run
<BR>
across problems with the adaptecs and kernels before about 2.2.17 or 18,
<BR>
can't remember the actual driver revision, though I can look it up.
