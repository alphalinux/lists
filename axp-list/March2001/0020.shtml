Hi Kirk,
<BR>
<P>The path mentioned there is simply a placeholder generated by RH's
<BR>
tools. If you look for the directory it points to it won't be there. I
<BR>
believe the reason it's there is so when folks go and do install TTF
<BR>
fonts they make their directory to the path already specified so
<BR>
everyone could have them in the place. Why didnt RH just create the dir?
<BR>
Well that would be too easy ;-) 
<BR>
<P><P>Now to your other questions.
<BR>
<P>There are a few tools on a RH system that will configure X for you. One
<BR>
of them is Xconfigurator, a tool of RH. Running that tool should
<BR>
generate an XF86Config like when the system was first installed. It
<BR>
probably references the font server. Honestly , I simply pull out the
<BR>
reference to the FS and code the paths in the XF86Config file. Don't
<BR>
have to worry about the xfs daemon dying. Now are you using RH-7.0 or
<BR>
something earlier? Reason being there is a switch passed to
<BR>
Xconfigurator that tells it which config file to write.
<BR>
The flags are --preferxf3 and --preferxf4 .
<BR>
<P>Regarding your type 1 fonts. It seems that the font index files may have
<BR>
been destroyed somehow. I know on my system it likes to eat my index
<BR>
files for my TTF fonts. You can try this and it may help. 
<BR>
<P>mkfontdir /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1
<BR>
<P>The font server is compilied with support for fonts. Same thing with
<BR>
XF-3.3.6 . In XF-4.0 you have to load a module per each type of font you
<BR>
want to display. That is if you're loading the fonts from the Xserver
<BR>
not the font server. BTW TTF fonts work with XF-4.0 you just need to
<BR>
load the 'xtt' backend instead of the 'truetype'.

<EM>&gt; Greetings all,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Whilst tampering with my Xserver configuration files (XF86Conf) in an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attempt to use the Matrox drivers instead of the default Super VGA drivers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I managed somehow to damage the settings for several of Xserv's dependent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; daemons, including the font server.  Strangely, it complains about a front
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; server based on True Type fonts during automatic system startup or manually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; invoking X, but continues to load.  Having searched the directory tree, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looks like I never had a True Type directory, only Type 1 PostScript fonts.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I compared the original configuration file created by Anaconda during
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; install, but it references the same TType directories, though I do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recall any errors, what gives?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, I noticed several tools for configuring the Xserver which I presume to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have been partly X generic, Red Hat derived and XFree derived.  There was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; XF86Configurator, XF86Config, X86Cfg and a few others.  Each of these seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to write the XF86Conf file differently as though different versions of XFree
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were being targetted (though it does not give any warning of this).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps If I understood which tool was the correct one, I could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simultaneously fix the font server problem (it complians, but still loads
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the X session, albeit with odd looking screen fonts) as well as tune my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; configuration file.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Right now, I have a hand built XF86Conf file with bits from each of the X
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; configuration tools, though when I passed it the directory to the Type 1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Post Script fonts that Red Hat's original installer created, it refuses to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recognize it as a legitimate directory.  Perhaps the font server that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being loaded is not Type 1 PS aware but True Type?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I was tempted to see if I could install Metro or the other pay-ware Xservers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just to see what it's configuration looked like and then de-install the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; demo. I've read through the XFree documentation, but do not see anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specific to this issue.  I thought that saving the original configuration
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; file would be sufficient, but clearly some other configuration file has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; touched.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Your assistance is appreciated.

<EM>&gt; No, my hack isn't needed, but ignoring disabled ROMs makes a sense
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in any case.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; And what about the other OSes that XFree runs on?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I think the X folks took the &quot;direct&quot; approach, rather than have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fiddle around with different facilities in different OSes and even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; different versions, changing over time, etc, etc...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Looking at 4.0 code I have an impression that they try to use OS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; facilities if possible...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Interesting, XFree86 on linux *does* read /proc/bus/pci/devices
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Xserver/hw/xfree86/os-support/linux/lnx_pci.c:xf86GetPciSizeFromOS()),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but obviously it fails sometimes. So we just need to fix this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; function (or kernel, whichever is broken ;-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'll investigate this tomorrow.
