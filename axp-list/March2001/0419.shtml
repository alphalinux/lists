<P>
I have two ES40s and I am trying to find a stable software set for
<BR>
them.
<BR>
<P>node 1: 8GB, 4 CPUs
<BR>
node 2: 2GB, 2 CPUs 
<BR>
<P>Other common equipment: DE600, Myrinet Lanai 7, Qlogic QLA2200 FC.
<BR>
<P>I started with RedHat 6.2 and then upgraded the kenrels and other software
<BR>
packages listed in /usr/src/linux/documentation/changes.txt.
<BR>
<P>I have been fighting with 2.2.19 and 2.4.2.  I have heard that the
<BR>
PCI bus support is much better in 2.4.2 for SMP alpha boxes.  I would
<BR>
like to stick with 2.2.19 though as all the other alpha linux boxes
<BR>
are running 2.2.18 (and soon 2.2.19).  Moving to 2.4.XX is not an option
<BR>
at this time for the other boxes.
<BR>
<P>I have been working with both boxes with the DE600 card.  This has been
<BR>
a nightmare.  I cannot get the ethernet card to reliably work.  Under
<BR>
heavy loads (dd of a file over NFS to an SGI server) I get messages like
<BR>
the following:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e01 kernel: eth0: Transmit timed out: status 0050  0c00 at 39554015
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command 000c0000
<BR>
<P>I have read on this list and on the eepro list that this just happens
<BR>
with the eepro100 cards.  I have not yet found a solution.  I have tried
<BR>
a 3com 3c905B card and this problem goes away.  However, I want SRM support
<BR>
so this is not a long term solution.
<BR>
<P>I have tried the drivers with the kernels, I have tried Becker's latest
<BR>
driver (v1.13) and I have tried the Intel driver with Soohoon Lee's patch.
<BR>
Nothing helps fix the above problem.
<BR>
<P>Besides this I am having stability problems with both kernels.  I have
<BR>
been running some multi-threaded programs.  They are openmp versions
<BR>
of the NAS Parallel benchmarks using the openmp compiler from rwcp.
<BR>
I am going to try some non-threaded applications, but still max out
<BR>
all the CPUs to see how things work.
<BR>
<P>I just would like to know what kind of setups users with ES40s are using
<BR>
with Linux?
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
Craig
