<P>
Peter,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;- EV6 is way too expensive. 
</EM><BR>
<P>You've got that right.  Like you, I'm waiting to see the results of the IBM
<BR>
fabbing of the Alpha. They are a good source for silicon, Sun Ecache debacle
<BR>
aside.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Alternatives? 21164A and 21164PC fabbed at todays more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;efficient micron yields and clocked higher. I suspect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a 700MHz 21164PC would be more than adaquate for a LCA.
</EM><BR>
<P>Who would fab the 21164A/21164PCx parts?  Mitsubishi fabbed 21164PC for a
<BR>
time, they could pick it up again if they could make some profit off of it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;- Features? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If you're starting from scratch , sticking with a bus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;entirley made up of PCI may be your best bet cost &amp; time to market wise.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You wouldnt have to deviate &quot;that&quot; much from the LX/SX reference board
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;designs. If you want to build a board
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with AGP that could take  alittle longer and cost more money.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you want AGP, you can't use Tsunami/Typhoon (a pricey chipset that's
<BR>
great for servers), leaving the AMD and VIA chipsets as the only options.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;For the folks claiming without AGP you wont have any video cards. You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can develop this board with say openfirmware and have access to all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;vid cards MACs have access to. Or develop an emulator that will execute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their forth based bios.
</EM><BR>
<P>If not OpenBoot firmware, some free implementation thereof, like FICL.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;- USB should be included and functional at the firmware level. So no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more PS/2 ports. I can see atleast 4 USB ports...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- Ethernet could be included. insert the cheapest chipset here. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- firewire, include if cheap enough to implement.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- Sound, maybe, maybe not. 
</EM><BR>
<P>IEEE 1394 chipsets from TI and IBM are quite cheap, not much more expensive
<BR>
than the USB 2.0 chipsets at much higher frequency.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;- OS support?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Decisions made here will directly influnece what chipsets are used. If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you want Tru64/VMS support then you must go with tsunami. Which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expensive.  
</EM><BR>
<P>OpenVMS support is probably not going to happen, nice as it would be.  Ditto
<BR>
for Tru64.  Compaq is putting the screws to the whole non-Compaq
<BR>
Tru64/OpenVMS biz, a lack of hardware will make it all but impossible to run
<BR>
these OSs as a home hobbyist on anything but old gear.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;dont expect any LCA to approach the price of a rock bottom priced PC. A
</EM><BR>
reasonable expectation is 30%-40% above
<BR>
<EM>&gt;what a mid-range PC costs and no they wont have matching bells and
</EM><BR>
whistles.
<BR>
<P>Given the lower production numbers, I'd be happy to see one of these in the
<BR>
$1,500 to $1,900 range.  A .18 micron 21164A with an 8MB L3 should do nicely
<BR>
at 1GHz. : )
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;-Conclusion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- Folks get together and start your own company and develop such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;products.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- VARs looking to expand their offerings and become an OEM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- Wait and see how the UP1500 does and go from there. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Good stuff Peter.  
<BR>
