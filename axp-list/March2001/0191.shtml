<P>
Kurt,
<BR>
<P>The cheat is for half flash, if you had AlphaBIOS resident, you would type
<BR>
&quot;os_type nt&quot; and the system could be rebooted under Alphabios.  The
<BR>
directions I described allow you to bring up AlphaBIOS when you have a
<BR>
machine flashed with SRM only.  You can even use AlphaBIOS's simpler upgrade
<BR>
facility to update the SRM console to the latest.  When you reboot, SRM is
<BR>
back again and you'll find not a trace of AlphaBIOS.  I would suspect (but
<BR>
have not tried) that if you changed any boot settings in AlphaBIOS they
<BR>
would be flushed at reboot as the NVRAM contents is formatted differently by
<BR>
SRM.

AlphaBIOS / ARC from a floppy?
