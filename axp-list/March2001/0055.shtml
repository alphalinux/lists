Subject: Rh-7.0 upgrade. X no worky anymore
<BR>
<P><P>Strange, I hope others have run into this and found a fix already though
<BR>
I have not found any reference in the mailinglist archives. My old LX/2
<BR>
running 6.2 was upgraded to 7.0. Now Xfree-4.0 does not work. even the
<BR>
DRI build I used when I ran 6.2 doesnt work, even after I rebuilt it.
<BR>
What happens is X starts and comes up all the way but then my keyboard
<BR>
and mouse go dead. I can't shutdown the system gracefully and have to
<BR>
clunk it. I don't have immediate network access to the machine. Anyone
<BR>
else run into this?
<BR>
<P>I also tried installing RH-7.0 fresh on a spare HD (what I should have
<BR>
done to begin with) and I see the same problems with X 4.0. X 3.3.6
<BR>
starts but its kinda broken. I.e when I move windows they aren't
<BR>
redrawn... I've also tried the Xfree RPMS from rawhide, no luck. The
<BR>
video card is a voodoo 3000 PCI , default RH Alpha kernel (2.2.17-4) ,
<BR>
and i'm running SRM 5.8-1.
