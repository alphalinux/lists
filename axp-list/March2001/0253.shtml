<P><EM>&gt; Hi,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've been thinking about doing the RedHat Certified Engineer Course. I was wondering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If anyone had done the course and whether they thought it was useful?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I took the course and passed the exam about 2 years ago.  It was very
<BR>
worth it to me.  I don't know if the course has changed.
<BR>
<P>Will it be worth it to you?  Depends.
<BR>
<P>I had several years experience as a UNIX (Ultrix/DU) system manager and I
<BR>
knew very little about Linux specifically.  I didn't need much to bring me
<BR>
up to speed.  I think it helped my confidence as much as anything.
<BR>
<P>The exam is different than any of the other certification exams around,
<BR>
since it consists of one section of multiple choice questions, and two
<BR>
sections of hands-on exam:  one troubleshooting, one complete system
<BR>
installation/configuration implementing an assigned list of services.
<BR>
Both exercises were very realistic and useful.
<BR>
<P>Now, in the class that I was in, a large percentage of people were there
<BR>
to get a feel for what Linux was all about.  They were Window NT or
<BR>
Netware system managers and/or consultants, and boy were they lost!  If
<BR>
you have trouble with the Gnome GUI or if you are lost without a GUI, then
<BR>
you'd have a hard time here!
<BR>
<P>The class goes over material very quickly, assuming that you do have some
<BR>
foundation.  While you don't have to take EVERY listed prerequisite
<BR>
seriously, you should have a good foundation with UNIX system programming
<BR>
if not with Linux.  While the instructors were very good, in general, the
<BR>
time frame is too short to take the time for too much hand-holding, so
<BR>
fasten your seatbelt if you decide to go.  On the other hand, there were
<BR>
experienced Linux system and application programmers in the course that
<BR>
just breezed through the course - it is not an ADVANCED RedHat Cert Exam.
<BR>
As I said, it demonstrates basic, useful system config/management.
<BR>
Also, you are coming from the AXP Linux world.  The course is an I386
<BR>
course, mostly.  The instructor may have experience with AXP and can also
<BR>
pass on your questions to other instructors, but not much time is given to
<BR>
other versions of RHL than I386.
<BR>
<P>So, is it worth it?  For me it was.
<BR>
