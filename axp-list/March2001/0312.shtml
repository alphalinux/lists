<P>
Speaking of file system problems, I have one that maybe folks on this
<BR>
list can help solve.
<BR>
<P>I recently got a API UP2000 with two 833 MHz processors and 3 disk
<BR>
drives.  A 36 GB drive is used as the boot disk running some recent
<BR>
dist of RH linux.  Two 73 GB drives were RAID 0'd together to form a
<BR>
very large volume for data storage.  All drives are on the base SCSI
<BR>
bus on the mother board, which I think is Ultra-II Fast Wide SCSI.
<BR>
(This was the way it was delivered, and I haven't had a chance to do
<BR>
much with it yet.)  If anyone from API is watching, this is the system
<BR>
you provided to WSM for me to evaluate.
<BR>
<P>I tried to run a simple file I/O test program to check the performance
<BR>
of RAID 0 on the same bus, as I've heard of some people getting pretty
<BR>
good results this way.  The program is very simple; it simply creates a
<BR>
file, and starts to write a specified buffer size of random data to the
<BR>
file a specified number of times.  In the standard tests that I run,
<BR>
the buffer size is 1 MB, mem aligned to 65536 bytes, and I write 1024
<BR>
of them to create a 1GB file.  My test brought lots of SCSI errors in
<BR>
the system log file, and the mounted partition became inaccessible.  I
<BR>
was able to dismount it, but remount attempts gave errors complaining
<BR>
of unsupported fs type.  fsck got similar errors.
<BR>
<P>I tried running the same test on the 36 GB root disk, and managed to
<BR>
complete the run, but only got about 3.3 MB/s transfer rate.  This
<BR>
seems awefully slow for Ultra-II SCSI.  According to the specs I've
<BR>
seen for most 36 GB disks, they should be able to run between 20-45
<BR>
MB/s rates depending on which zone your data happens to have landed,
<BR>
with average of 30 MB/s.
<BR>
<P>Right now, the system is down for some reason, and I can't get to it
<BR>
until Monday.  In the mean time, can anyone provide any pointers on
<BR>
disk and RAID setup in Linux?  I am most interested in high
<BR>
performance, but also need reliability (who doesn't?).
<BR>
<P>thanks in advance,
<BR>
