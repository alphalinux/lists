Andrei,
<BR>
<P>Alpha/NT list has a bunch of us, including vendors for SCSI controllers,
<BR>
storage devices and backup software (BEI's Paul Bunn in particular). The
<BR>
Alpha/NT list is fairly devoid of useful talk these days owing to our
<BR>
currently dead/dying OS/platform combination thanks to Compaq and MS.  A few
<BR>
questions about SCSI that don't get to OS specific (as these do not) will
<BR>
get you quite a few very authorative answers.  The Use/News groups for SCSI
<BR>
are pretty low quality.  Tru64's list serve is pretty execllent as well,
<BR>
remember to maintain good discipline with your replies (change your subject
<BR>
lines, cut off unnecessary and old parts of the thread) and you'll get a
<BR>
good audience.
<BR>
<P>--KE

<P>Thanks a lot to Kirk for his detailed explanation !
<BR>
<P>I just wanted to ask one question.
<BR>
Recently I got interested in subj - SCSI performance that is.
<BR>
To my huge surprise, unlike CPI/L1/TLB related discussions
<BR>
of how to save one-two CPU cycles, SCSI performance
<BR>
does not seem to attract similar research activity.
<BR>
scsi*. and *.storage newsgroups devote 99.9% of the bandwidth
<BR>
to flammage and discussions of LVD termination.
<BR>
linux-scsi and freebsd-scsi lists aren't active either.
<BR>
I'm just wondering are there any people working in this area
<BR>
and if yes, where do they discuss it ?
<BR>
<P>Thanks a lot to Kirk again,
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
<P>Andrei
