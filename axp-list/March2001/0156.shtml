<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree. I &quot;like&quot; SRM. I'm confortable with it and have come to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; appreciate all the neat things it can do for you. Never is there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; a &quot;BIOS&quot; I have seen that gives you so much control
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; and does it with as much grace as SRM console does.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, this is one of the main things that drives people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; away from setting up Alphas.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Exactly what survey did you do/see that allowed you to make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this conclusion?
</EM><BR>
<P>Unfortunately, nothing as formal as a survey.  It has been my limited
<BR>
experience in helping some people in migrating from NT.  You can
<BR>
probably fault me in that my experience is limited.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; My biggest beef with SRM is   DOCUMENTATION.   As far as I can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; find there is none, at least not up to date.  There's an ancient
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; one in the Compaq/Digital documentation archive.  But I've never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; seen a current one.  Not even on the firmware update CD.  And
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; help &lt;command&gt; is too vague for some of the commands.  (If it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; matters I have a LX164 with SRM 5.8-1.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Every Compaq Alpha system I've bought that came with SRM had SRM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; documention. Never have gotten SRM documentation for API systems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have but since I had the docs for other systems, it didn't matter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SRM docs are online. Search www.compaq.com for &quot;console reference&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks, but that really only helps if I have a DS, ES or GS system.
<BR>
I have a PC64 and LX164.
