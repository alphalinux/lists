<EM>&gt; Greetings all,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I mentioned what I think is the collective desire for an affordable Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system in a previous post.  Lets go one step further with this by actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; coming up with a list of system requirements, capabilities and ultimately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cost for such a unit.  You can't have it all, so the completed system will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to be an artful compromise.  A low cost Alpha is not in-and-of-itself a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real product category, it must be more clearly defined as being an entry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point to a larger class of systems with similar architecture, console and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operating system support.  The ultimate goal of this task should be to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; produce a working set of qualities that will make it suitable for use in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software development, testing, hardware/OS training and quite hopefully,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mind share outside the Alpha enthusiast ranks.  The form factor, level of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; integration and overall system cost should be similar to that of offerings
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by other vendors at a similar performance level (Sun Blade, Apple iMac,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; etc).  The fact that many users of this list, as well as many other Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lists as well, own and operate such venerable systems as the Multia (AKA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; UDB) are evidence of the enduring success of such designs.

<P>I think there are a couple of problems that we are looking at here.
<BR>
<P>Only Compaq and API are making Alpha mother boards. There are other
<BR>
manufactures of special products like Force for special applications but
<BR>
these are low volume and high price.(I could be wrong here but I have
<BR>
looked and had little luck so I am sure that this is the case)
<BR>
<P>Of these 2 Compaq is interested in selling only complete systems and
<BR>
seem to have dropped the old DEC OEM stuff. They also only sell the
<BR>
Alphas through the server channel which is designed for lower volumes
<BR>
higher value add and higher prices. It would be nice to be able to buy
<BR>
an alpha workstation directly off the Compaq web site.
<BR>
<P>I am not quite sure what API's target market is. I think they are trying
<BR>
to stick with the higher margin multi-processor and cluster market. the
<BR>
UP1100 is now end of life and although the 1500 is in the works there is
<BR>
no assurances from API that they will be selling the 1500 or any single
<BR>
processor board in the near future.
<BR>
<P>The cost of developing, producing and selling a motherboard can be quite
<BR>
high and in the case of the Alpha where the volumes are low the problems
<BR>
are compounded.
<BR>
<P>At one time API announced that a deal that would the AMD processor using
<BR>
the same motherboard interface as the Alpha. I had hoped that this would
<BR>
mean that there would be a reason for companies to build motherboards
<BR>
that would support both the K7 and the Alpha. To date I think only API
<BR>
has a mother board that will do this(UP2000). The CPU's alone for this
<BR>
board run over $2000 each.
<BR>
<P>The problem as I see it is not that there are no inexpensive systems
<BR>
based on the Alpha but no inexpensive motherboards based on the Alpha.
<BR>
<P>These are only my opinions and observations. Anybody please feel free to
<BR>
correct me.
