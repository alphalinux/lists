<EM>&gt; &gt; Yes but the kicker here is you have to load that secondary bootloader
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; from an SRM supported device. So unless you always want to load
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; firmware X off a floppy (which isnt the most reliable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; medium in the world) you're back to square one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe you can load the firmware off of CDROM too.  If I recall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right, I think this is how the firmware update CD works.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; EXT2 support in SRM is nice but whats stopping SRM from loading linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; off a FAT fs of which it already understands?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I thought SRM did not understand filesystems.  I thought it knew
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough about a device to pull physical blocks of media into memory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and execute the code from there... that's why aboot was written to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; read the ext2 partition and load the kernel.(?)
</EM><BR>
<P>It understand filesystems, but doesn't understand partition tables...if I
<BR>
remember correctly. After all it can read a FAT floppy, or an iso9660 or
<BR>
UFS CDROM.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; What would really help for those that may still run NT or perfer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slightly more sane partition table format is if SRM could be told to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; look for the boot block somewhere other than what is the DOS/PC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; style partition table sector. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If I could drill it into people's head to use BOOTP as their primary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; boostrap method this discussion wouldnt have half the urgency it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; presents since the #1 killer here is not being able to boot off host
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; adapter X. Again, I'm assuming here that majority of  people have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; small private networks with a DHCP server. It's not like you can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; get a SRM support ethernet device, Any intel nic will do. I wish 3Com
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; worked as well but ho hum.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah but telling a new user they must have a network just to boot the
<BR>
machines is a little much.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The other problem with BOOTP is the person just getting started with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux and/or Alpha.  Setting up another server just to boot a Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will scare even more people away for time and money reasons.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I agree that the host adapter list is way too short and wish it could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; extended.  Problem is from a engineering POV. If you just added X new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; features to SRM console you now have X regression tests to set guidelines
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for and implement.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Else you document what you did, make an errata, and call the software an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; unsupported BETA. Both require some amount of engineering resources but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; before that there would need to be a concensus from managment to implement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; one of the projects to begin with.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, how about _removing_ some of the more esoteric features of SRM to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stand-alone executables.  I'm talking about things like memexer, isacfg,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; etc. that are nice but take up space and you don't need them to boot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the machine all the time.  ARC/AlphaBIOS was good for this as it had a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SDK that you can program with your own add-ons  (ARCDOS being one example).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The executables could be loaded from disk or floppy.  If those features
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could be moved out of SRM and still being accessable (say on a bootable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CD) for those that need it, then you could put more enhancments into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the base SRM.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hey....wait a minute here....you may not use those commands, that doesn't
<BR>
mean that other don't.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Video support would be a &quot;nice thing&quot;.  It's not a need per say but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; those of us with 3 year old LX's who don't have the ching to spend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on a UP1K &quot;just&quot; to get a AGP graphics card is unreasonable. Especially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; so since there hasnt been an &quot;affordable&quot; Alpha in the price/value
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; market since the SX and that was... almost 3 years ago. A new bios
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; emulator would let folks able to go out and get the PCI Radeon cards,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Oxygen GVX1 cards (which X has yet to support AFAIK), and IBM's fireGL
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 1 (has that been released yet?). Short list yes  but the list is too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; short as it stands already.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I disagree.  Video support is number 2 after storage controllers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How many times do we watch and see the new PCI/AGP card-of-the-month 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; come out and go ooooh that would just make my Alpha fly, only to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one and be greeted with a blank screen (if you're lucky it boots at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all).  I mean I'd love to slap a Geforce2 MX into a PC64, but it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't work.  On the flip side when the Multia's got blown out and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everyone seemed to be buying one, there were all sorts of inquiries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the lists about which card can use etc.  Some people were able
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to find the S3 cards.  I don't know what the people that could not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; find one did, hopefully not junk the board.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I know you can't please everyone all the time.  And I know it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does boil down to money at some point.  It's too bad that at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for video that the emulator couldn't be seperated from the console
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in some way so people with old machines could at least update the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; emulator.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's an interesting idea....seperating the emulator binary from
<BR>
SRM. Don't know it it's possible or not...they may be to tightly coupled
<BR>
for this to happen.
