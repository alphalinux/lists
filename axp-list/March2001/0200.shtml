<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't believe so.  Linus had SRM because he did his early development
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; on OSF/1, before Alpha/Linux became self-hosting.  As a nice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; side-effect, Linux and OSF/1 (now Tru64) became compatible at the system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; call layer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Not comletely, remember Linux cannot handle Tru64 threads...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe that's due to Linux not supporting certain kernel functions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the Tru64 kernel has and the threads library is looking for them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Right.  The point I didn't make is that Linus really only implemented
<BR>
the syscalls he needed to get a self-hosting system, and Linux/OSF
<BR>
syscalls have probably diverged since anyway.  You can bet that Linux
<BR>
also has syscalls that Tru64 does not.
<BR>
<P>I don't use Tru64, but I'd wager that its thread APIs are based on Mach
<BR>
tasks, which could be very difficult to emulate (feel free to correct me
<BR>
here).  Although Linux can run with Mach (as in MkLinux for PPC) to my
<BR>
knowledge nobody has attempted that on Alpha.
