<P>We generally release SRM versions with support for all of our currently

supported platforms.  I don't know of any reason 5.9 would be different.

<P>All.

<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Ummm...not quite. API's Linux in ROM is not based on the OpenBIOS

<EM>&gt; Is the project entirely in-house, or did you outsource some of the work?
</EM><BR>
<P>And what in the world does that have to do with the price of tea?
<BR>
<P>As with all projects we use whatever mix of in-house and outsourced

talent we feel is appropriate for the requirements.  And no, we don't

disclose this, any more than we say who we buy our laser printer

paper from.
