Although memexer, and other testing/diagnostic functions may not be used much, when they are you do not want to be digging trying to find the disk with the version that works with the version of SRM installed and the model of hardware you have, and hoping the CD/floppy has not been damaged.  Although I agree a hook of some sort to allow an binary to run could be useful.

Well, how about _removing_ some of the more esoteric features of SRM to
<BR>
stand-alone executables.  I'm talking about things like memexer, isacfg,
<BR>
etc. that are nice but take up space and you don't need them to boot
<BR>
the machine all the time.  ARC/AlphaBIOS was good for this as it had a
<BR>
SDK that you can program with your own add-ons  (ARCDOS being one example).
<BR>
The executables could be loaded from disk or floppy.  If those features
<BR>
could be moved out of SRM and still being accessable (say on a bootable
<BR>
CD) for those that need it, then you could put more enhancments into
<BR>
the base SRM.
