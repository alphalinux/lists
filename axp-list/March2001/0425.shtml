Alvin,
<BR>
<P>Adaptec RAID stuff was never tested or certified under Alpha, I would advise
<BR>
sticking with Mylex where commonality between what Digital/Compaq OEM
<BR>
(particularly through the StorageWorks group) and the commercially available
<BR>
product is extremely similar if not identical.  Note that I have only begun
<BR>
playing with Ultra2 based RAID controllers on Alpha, though eXtremeRAID 1100
<BR>
(EOL) and eXtremeRAID 2000 should be functional assuming the efforts to port
<BR>
the drivers remains on target (these are still beta projects).  You will
<BR>
probably still have to boot from a more conventional SCSI controller (such
<BR>
as the Qlogic 1040B/C or the LSI Logic 875J/895) or netboot to the kernel
<BR>
from a BOOTP server to bypass lack of support for the RAID controller in SRM
<BR>
via a supported network card (21x4x Tulip based network controller). 
<BR>
<P>Good luck.

Subject: Hardware raid.
<BR>
<P><P>I have an Adaptec(was DPT) 2100s raid controller That I would like to
<BR>
get running under linux on one of our alphas. 
<BR>
<P>This controller uses drivers supplied by Adaptec. The first problem I
<BR>
seem to have is that the PCI  configuration is not working correctly. It
<BR>
seems as though the IO memory space on the card is not being mapped
<BR>
correctly by the PCI initialization code. This of course causes the
<BR>
kernel to lock up hard.
<BR>
<P>Anybody have any suggestions/ideas?.
<BR>
Are there any known working raid controllers?
<BR>
<P><PRE>
