<P>
Mysterious.
<BR>
<P>If you use DISKEDIT from the Norton tools, or your favorite disk-sector editor,
<BR>
you can load the boot-sector from the drive.  For partition 1 this means that you
<BR>
need to load sector 0/1/1 (usually LBA 63 or 255 depending on
<BR>
geometry/translation).  You will find the cluster-size set at offset 0x0d in that
<BR>
sector, and it is defined as number of sectors per cluster and the value must be a
<BR>
power of 2:  1, 2, 4, 8 etc.
<BR>
DISKEDIT should let you view the data as a FAT boot-sector (FAT32 is a superset of
<BR>
the FAT data) so you can review the other values too.
<BR>

Subject: OT: cluster size=0
<BR>
<P><P>Sorry for the OT, but I am really stumped on this one.  I was attempting
<BR>
to back up a win95 FAT32 partition by doing a 'tar -cvf' on it and storing
<BR>
the tar file on another disk.  I had some problems as the tar file would
<BR>
exceed 2GB and then tar would die telling me that the archive was too big
<BR>
to continue (even though there was 15GB still available on the device
<BR>
where the archive was being written).  [I figure that the 2GB things was
<BR>
due to the fact that it was a 2.2.14 kernel that must not have supported a
<BR>
file size above 2GB. This seems less important right now.]
<BR>
Some how the cluster size on the FAT32 parition got changed to 0.  The
<BR>
partition is still intact.  I haven't changed the parition type, formated,
<BR>
reformated or any of the above. Nothing has been written to the partition
<BR>
and the parition itself still shows to be intact.  I can even boot from
<BR>
the drive (using lilo on the MBR) as long as I don't boot from that
<BR>
parition (partition 1, on my machine /dev/hda1 occupying sec 1-511).
<BR>
Roughly a 4GB partition.
<BR>
<P>How do I get the cluster size set back to what it was (the standard
<BR>
win95 FAT32 size) or alternatively, get the data off of that partition.  I
<BR>
haven't had any luck attempting to mount it under linux.  I have tried
<BR>
dosfsck, fsck.vfat/fsck.msdos, partition magic 4.0, revival, PQDI, Norton
<BR>
Disk Doctor (old Dos version).  I haven't allowed anything to write to the
<BR>
disk.  I have only attempted reads.  The data is important or I would just
<BR>
back up the rest of the disk and repartition it.
