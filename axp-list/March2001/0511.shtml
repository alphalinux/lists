<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; With regards to your message at 05:08 PM 4/6/01, KirkE@paccessglobal.com.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Where you stated:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Greg,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;API already has the UP1100, which uses AMD's chipset. I haven't asked,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;but one would presume that they will continue to have a low-end
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;machine using the least expensive motherboard possible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I have been informed that UP1100 is EOL.  As is the older SlotB based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;UP1000.  At this point, only the Samsung product (not an API product)
</EM><BR>
with a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;name dangerously similar to those built and sold by APIis slated to have
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;AMD Iron Gate G4 (761), dubiously named the UP1500. Samsung has some info
</EM><BR>
on
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;their site about it, though it is still under &quot;development.&quot; At first I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;thought that the UP1500 would be a fairly innovative offering to provide
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Alpha platform community with an &quot;enthusiast&quot;/ entry level programmer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;workstation or web appliance.  On closer inspection however, it looks
</EM><BR>
like
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;it has retained the rather unusual UP1100 non-standard ATX arrangement, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;detail pointed out to me by a colleague.  This isn't much of a problem in
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;desk side workstation I should think, but would probably pose a problem
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;sourcing rack mount chassis that would fit without obscuring slots,
</EM><BR>
drives
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;or memory banks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually the case is NOT an issue.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, the PCI slots are offset from the default ATX locations, but the cost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of 2U cases for this is not exorbitant. For example our company provides a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2U with 400W power, 3 slot PCI riser, full extension slides, hotswap fans,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2 x 5.25&quot; bays, etc. for $325.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And VERY few Alphas have ever fit into a &quot;standard&quot; case, so this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing new..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The real issue will be wether or not API will be able to deliver in N.
</EM><BR>
America.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; For example the UP1100 has been available here in only the 600MHz version,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whereas Samsung has also been selling the UP1100 in a 700MHz overseas.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Considering the memory bandwidth limitations of the 1100, the extra
</EM><BR>
&quot;oomph&quot;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of the faster processor was/is important. With the new DDR based UP1500 I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think it will be a VERY nice machine!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The only deadlock we see is if there will be enough supply of DDR cache
</EM><BR>
RAM
<BR>
<EM>&gt; for these to be built.. Try buying a DDR Alpha CPU module nowadays..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Sun has managed to produce some excellent low-cost systems that are
</EM><BR>
selling
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;like hotcakes.  The added benefit is that exposure and access ultimately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;leads to increased acceptance and a larger user base, along with the
</EM><BR>
obvious
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;benefit of more software (and often better software). The Sun Blade 100,
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Netra X1 AC200 and the new line of SPARCEngine motherboards including the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;AXi and the AXe are making it easier and cheaper to buy, build or OEM an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Ultra SPARC II based system (and soon enough, Ultra III). I bought an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;SPARCEngine AXi with a 360MHz UIIi CPU and 256MB of RAM from NU Horizons
</EM><BR>
for
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;little more than $700.00.  An Ultra 30 coming off of lease soon followed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;It's now possible to obtain a 500 MHz IIe system like the Netra X1 or the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Sun Blade 100 for less than $1,000, but there is absolutely nothing
</EM><BR>
similar
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;in the Alpha arsenal.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The only new and interesting lower end Sun board is the AXI1105 and the
</EM><BR>
Blade.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; And they are not without teething issues. I know, as I have an 1105 here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is a nice design, but it is still not &quot;ready for prime time&quot;. For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; example the keyboard and mouse ports do not work yet! Sun assures me that
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; new ROM BIOS revision will fix that &quot;real soon now&quot;. It also requires a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;special&quot; version of Solaris 8. And Linux does not run on it yet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Having broached the question more than once for a quote from most of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;vendors still selling Alpha solutions, obtaining a 4.5 year old 164LX
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;motherboard with a 533 or 600MHz EV56 CPU is usually about a $900 to
</EM><BR>
$1200
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;proposition, and that's before integrating an actual system together.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Having gone this route in the past, I'm inclined to suggest to obtaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;systems that are already fully integrated and guaranteed fully
</EM><BR>
functional.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I obtained my last Alpha through Ebay auctions and scored a PWS 600au
</EM><BR>
with
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;512MB memory and an 18GB drive for under $1,000 (not the going rate, even
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;year later).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;At current, the only practical, low cost option for Alpha platform
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;enthusiasts (ranging from the stalwart OpenVMS crowd/DECUS groups, the
</EM><BR>
BSD
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;camp, the living-dead of the Alpha/NT camp and the Alpha/Linux camp),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;students or programmers is for obtaining out of date hardware through the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;auction sites or calling up leasing companies that occasionally give up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Digital branded workstations and servers for a song. It could be said
</EM><BR>
there
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;is no Alpha workstation market anymore, but what are all those clustered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Alpha systems that are filling the computing media being programmed on?
</EM><BR>
How
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;many people on this list would be willing to part with $1,500 or so to be
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;fully integrated &quot;Sun Blade&quot; style Alpha, just to keep their stake in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;platform, write some code and keep their platform specific skills up? If
</EM><BR>
it
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;could run OpenVMS and Tru64, there would be an automatic market in the
</EM><BR>
DECUS
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;crowd and plenty of shops with an OpenVMS and Tru64 investment would snap
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;them up. Linux users would love them as they would be price competitive
</EM><BR>
with
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Athlon Thunderbirds on the X86 front. Whatever replaces the UP1x00 needs
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;address these issues, its been so long since a cost-effective solution
</EM><BR>
worth
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;buying has come out, they'd be all the rage.  There would be dozens of
</EM><BR>
ways
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to promote such a system.  Sun is proof enough it can be done (remember
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;an old Ultra II based system like the Ultra Enterprise 450 workgroup
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;server/workstation still fetches some $20,000 for the base unit and
</EM><BR>
another
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;$2800 per 450MHz CPU).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A good bet for low cost is the Compaq XP1000 units. The older 500MHz
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; version is available for under $6000. Good memory bandwidth, nice design.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; At $13000+ the 667 they still sell is vastly overpriced. But the clear-out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 500's are a good deal.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree that there is some level of &quot;ball dropping&quot; in the Alpha low cost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; camp, and we need to look no further than the fact that it WILL get
</EM><BR>
better.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Now is just a lousy time if you want both the latest and a cheap price..
