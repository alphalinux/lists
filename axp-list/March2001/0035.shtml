<P><EM>&gt; Hello everybody,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For quite a while now I have problems with my alpha-PC164 running RH6.2. From
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time to time, the machine locks himself up completly, no ping-reply anymore,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just a hard reset helps.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  In search of a problem I did nearly everything that came to my mind: ...
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Changing the network-card from NE2000-PCI to NE2000-ISA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and a 3Com PCI-card didn't change anything. (all 10MB-cards)
</EM><BR>
<P>This kind of behavior has also long been a problem in my group of
<BR>
PC164 machines when using 100 Mb/sec NICs connected to
<BR>
100 Mb/sec switches.
<BR>
I have much more reliable behavior using an ethernet Pro100
<BR>
connected to our LAN through a 10 Mb/sec hub or switch.
<BR>
This throttle setup has made a big difference in my life.
<BR>
My PC164s appear to be stable running RedHat 7.0 with
<BR>
a custom 2.2.17 kernel and this 10 Mb/sec bottleneck.
<BR>
I've not had good results with a 2.4 kernel yet, but
<BR>
I haven't tried the latest.
<BR>
<P>I also had a similar problem involving some earlier versions of Gnome.
<BR>
When Gnome was removed, the problem was solved.
<BR>
This doesn't sound like your problem...
