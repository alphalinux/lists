<EM>&gt;   &gt; While in theory I agree, remember that SRM is there to boot DU/Tru64, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; until very recently there has been no adaptec support in that OS.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; As for dying a slow death...the SRM for the platform usually supports the

<EM>&gt;   &gt; devices that were common at the time.

<EM>&gt;   &gt; &gt; Is it just me or is there a hell of a lot that SRM doesn't &quot;recgonize&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; &gt; correctly.  I may be off base (hey what else is new) but it seems that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; &gt; SOMONE (err compaq) should be able to develop a SRM that understands most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; &gt; peoples video cards and common scsi cards (doesn't recgnise 2940?? sheesh)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; &gt; Anyone know if this is a possability, or is compaq just waiting for us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; &gt; &quot;low end&quot; linux guys to die a natural death?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   I am not sure any of us with older equipment should expect any support
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   for new deivices on older hardware. I can think of no company that will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   provide ongoing development of new capabilities in products that are no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   longer sold. In gerneral you are lucky if you can get bugs fixed let
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   alone any enhcnments.
</EM><BR>
<P>Personally, I'd like to see support for contemporary, 3rd-party, hardware
<BR>
before it becomes antique.
<BR>
<P>I don't think OUR &quot;older hardware&quot; is half the problem -- it's Compaq's
<BR>
&quot;old PCIhardware&quot; that is -- continuing support for incredibly proprietarty
<BR>
antiques like the PowerStorm cards is a good example. 
<BR>
<P>Aside from a very small 3D market, the PowerStorm cards are out-performed
<BR>
at radically cheaper prices by almost every other video card available
<BR>
today. ATI Radeon and nVeida Gforce immediately spring to mind. There was a
<BR>
time when the price premium might have been justifiable for support of
<BR>
&quot;high-end&quot; graphics, but not any more. You get conned into it because your
<BR>
only alternative is the Elsa Gloria junk. Then you are stuck running
<BR>
Tru64 or having lousy graphics. (I still want to be able to run my PS350 
<BR>
under Linux.) 
<BR>
<P>Philosophically within Compaq, the problem also comes from the fact that
<BR>
the Alpha Product line does NOT embrace &quot;Professional Workstations.&quot;
<BR>
Those are Wintel Boxes. Alpha workstations are a separate category and
<BR>
exist primarily because the VMS crowd within DECUS yelled and screamed
<BR>
sufficiently at the loss of the old single user VAX station that they got
<BR>
one created... then we (the Unix sig) had to yell and scream for another
<BR>
year   because that Alpha was announced as a VMS product only, with no
<BR>
plans for (then) Digital Unix to support it! The XP900 was the result.
<BR>
<P>Linux within Compaq is now an unknown quantity... mainly because it appears
<BR>
to have been taken over by the &quot;Industry Standard Server&quot; (ie Intel/Amd not 
<BR>
Alpha) folks. But then again that could just be the effect of the standard
<BR>
unix &quot;stealth marketing&quot; approach. 
<BR>
<P>I'm quite eager to find out what and if any changes are going to happen
<BR>
with the new head of the BSG... but so far I haven't seen any signs of a
<BR>
change in direction. ESPECIALLY on the marketing side. Stealth Marketing
<BR>
still rules... it gets really, really depressing.
