Peter,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;How about relaxing the the scope of which SRM decides to support a given
</EM><BR>
type of card,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;for example symbios based cards. I never understood why SRM needed to KNOW
</EM><BR>
the PCI vendor
<BR>
<EM>&gt;ID of every card it wanted to support. 
</EM><BR>
<P>A good point.  I suppose the justification is that the size of the driver
<BR>
that is used for a bootable device must be a very small footprint,
<BR>
increasing the generality (wrapping a range of chipsets across SCSI 1
<BR>
through SCSI 3 for example) would no doubt increase the size and complexity
<BR>
of the driver, which would also increase regression testing and further
<BR>
delay releases (the Compaq Party line). Given that 4, 8 and 16MB flash
<BR>
EEPROM parts have gotten quite cheap (mirroring the trend in more
<BR>
conventional SDRAM), it would at least be practical to increase the
<BR>
footprint of the console footprint from the 1MB or less to something with a
<BR>
larger device support.  Lengthened development time (assuming no significant
<BR>
increase in the number of engineers allocated) would of course apply.
<BR>
<P>API has started placing Linux in &quot;ROM,&quot; but I have not played with this to
<BR>
see how flexible the bootable configurations can be made as opposed to
<BR>
traditional console firmware. Its a good concept in any case. Other options
<BR>
exist as well (OpenBoot in particular) and are open source.
<BR>
<P>PALcode is the biggest sticking point all the way around. Alpha architecture
<BR>
requires it, so he who controls the PALcode and SRM licenses controls all.
<BR>
I have never been able to get a good answer out of Samsung/API whether their
<BR>
free reign over Alpha architecture permits them similar access to SRM and
<BR>
PALcode, I would only assume so.
<BR>
<P>--KE
