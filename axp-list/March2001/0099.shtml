Isn't the video init mostly x86 emulation?  After all, PCs don't need
<BR>
real mode video drivers; instead they rely on the BIOS and INT 10.
<BR>
<P>(I was about to say the same could be done for disk with INT 13, but I
<BR>
guess the BSD disklabel would be problematic.  Maybe that is how ARC
<BR>
worked, I don't know...)

<EM>&gt; Believe me, I understand the frustration (I experience it all the time as

<EM>&gt; _very_ small group of people with the ability to write this type of code
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (remember, PAL has to work directly with the hardware, and it has to fit into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the PROM, so a lot of the &quot;helpers&quot; we're used to don't exist).  Secondly, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; list of adapters that people would want _far_ outstrips the amount of time these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; excellent engineers have available to them.  And finally, I've been told there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are some things in the PAL that Compaq will never allow to be seen because they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are _that_ much of a competitive advantage (this could be wrong, I don't know).
