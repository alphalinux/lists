<P>
Of all the talks about the fabled low cost Alpha I
<BR>
thought I should offer my spin on things :-) From a manufacturing POV. 
<BR>
<P>- EV6 is way too expensive. 
<BR>
<P>You all remember the talk when EV6 was first released that EV6 was going
<BR>
to be soooooo cheap that everyone will buy one and things will get cheap
<BR>
etc etc. That never happened. So just cross off your list of low cost ==
<BR>
EV6. 
<BR>
<P>Alternatives? 21164A and 21164PC fabbed at todays more
<BR>
efficient micron yields and clocked higher. I suspect
<BR>
a 700MHz 21164PC would be more than adaquate for a LCA.
<BR>
<P><P>- Features? 
<BR>
If you're starting from scratch , sticking with a bus
<BR>
entirley made up of PCI may be your best bet cost &amp; time to market wise.
<BR>
You wouldnt have to deviate &quot;that&quot; much from the LX/SX reference board
<BR>
designs. If you want to build a board
<BR>
with AGP that could take  alittle longer and cost more money.
<BR>
<P>For the folks claiming without AGP you wont have any video cards. You
<BR>
can develop this board with say openfirmware and have access to all the
<BR>
vid cards MACs have access to. Or develop an emulator that will execute
<BR>
their forth based bios.
<BR>
<P><P>- USB should be included and functional at the firmware level. So no
<BR>
more PS/2 ports. I can see atleast 4 USB ports...
<BR>
- Ethernet could be included. insert the cheapest chipset here. 
<BR>
- firewire, include if cheap enough to implement.
<BR>
- Sound, maybe, maybe not. 
<BR>
<P>- OS support?
<BR>
<P>Decisions made here will directly influnece what chipsets are used. If
<BR>
you want Tru64/VMS support then you must go with tsunami. Which is
<BR>
expensive.  
<BR>
<P>So you wanna run just Linux? Irongate and IG-4 are good options. Maybe
<BR>
some VIA chipsets too. Yes these are lower performing chipsets and yes
<BR>
PC parts arent as reliable as DEC
<BR>
parts. It's a comprimise. 
<BR>
<P><P>Your IDE support and such depend on the chipset you use. 
<BR>
<P><P>- chips and such. 
<BR>
for as many toys you want built into the board it's still
<BR>
cheaper to add more PCI slots than to imbed something. I personally like
<BR>
the LX board that netapp has designed for use of their products. lots of
<BR>
PCI slots. It may be wise to start with this board as  a reference and
<BR>
reduce it until you reach what you want. 
<BR>
<P><P>- Pricing.
<BR>
<P>Begin flame war :-) 
<BR>
<P>PC's are cheap for a reason. Sure they have
<BR>
mass production on their side but their quality and
<BR>
reliablilty doesnt hold a candle to anything DEC/Q, SUN,
<BR>
or IBM makes. So dont expect any LCA to approach the price
<BR>
of a rock bottom priced PC. A reasonable expectation is 30%-40% above
<BR>
what a mid-range PC costs and no they wont have
<BR>
matching bells and whistles.
<BR>
<P><P>-Conclusion
<BR>
<P>Well, I ask the question to you business folks out there.
<BR>
Can I make money off this? You will have to invest money
<BR>
and resources into building your own boards and cpus. Now can you get a
<BR>
return? What markets are there that will buy these units complete for
<BR>
say $1200-$1500 (total guestimate)? 
<BR>
<P>I know I'm going to mangle this old addage but if you want somethign
<BR>
done right you have to do it yourself. Whatever your definition of right
<BR>
may be :-)
<BR>
<P>So in closing.
<BR>
<P>- Folks get together and start your own company and develop such
<BR>
products.
<BR>
- VARs looking to expand their offerings and become an OEM
<BR>
- Wait and see how the UP1500 does and go from there. 
<BR>
<P>Peter
