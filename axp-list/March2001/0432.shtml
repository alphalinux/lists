Hi folks...
<BR>
<P>-----Original Message-----

<P>Harware: Digital aplha server 1000A 5/300
<BR>
Jumpstart version : 1.1
<BR>
Linux: Redhet version 7.0
<BR>
Bios version : 5.70
<BR>
<P>I'm trying to install Redhet Linux 7.0 on this machine, when i start the 
<BR>
jumpstart cd ( boot dka400 -fl 0) it boots the cd and starts loading driver 
<BR>
etc, but after detecting a scsi cd rom drive the system stops.
<BR>
Does jump start work on an &quot;old&quot; 1000A 5/300 system?
<BR>
<P>As far as I know, yes. Sadly all the AS 1000 machines we have here seem to
<BR>
have gone to Alpha Heaven, so it hasn't been tested in a while. Do you see
<BR>
the &quot;Alpha JumpStart! 1.1 booting&quot; message before it locks up? If so, what
<BR>
is the last message you get before it hangs? What kind of SCSI controller is
<BR>
in the system?

<EM>&gt; It's possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the JumpStart makes assumptions about what SCSI controller your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CD-ROM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should be on or what SCSI IDs you should have set by default.  As the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CD-ROM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does a good amount of auto detection for your hardware, I'm still at a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; loss
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to explain what appears to be fairly common behavior.  If anyone within
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Compaq's development team for Jumpstart is on the list, perhaps they can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shed some light on this.  I will send a query directly with my errors and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; post to the list.

Yes, this is correct. The problem is that Linux and SRM use different
<BR>
methods for numbering devices. SRM thinks of the devices in terms of bus and
<BR>
hose, but Linux remaps each hose sequentially to a bus in /proc/pci. In
<BR>
addition, each Alpha system has its own quirks about how it numbers devices.
<BR>
PWS (Miata) machines will remap IDE devices to SCSI if os_type is set to
<BR>
UNIX. Machines earlier than EV6 ignore non-PCI buses when assigning PCI bus
<BR>
numbers, but EV6 and later machines will assign a non-PCI bus a PCI bus
<BR>
number, and then skip that bus number on all the hoses on the system. 
<BR>
<P>So to figure out what device is attached to what bus and what hose,
<BR>
JumpStart has to do a lot of guesswork. And since we no longer have any
<BR>
functioning AS/1000 machines, it would come as no surprise to me to find out
<BR>
that JumpStart was guessing wrong on something and getting all mixed up.
<BR>
However, this should not cause the machine to lock up.

<P>Just been throught this hoop - disconnect the DDS2 tape drive and try
<BR>
it, there was something about the tape that it didnt like - same goes
<BR>
for booting the 7 CD.
<BR>
<P>Hmm. Interesting.. plus it's something I can test. I'll go snag a tape drive
<BR>
from one of the deceased AS1000's and see if I can reproduce the problem.
