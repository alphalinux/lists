<P>
Chris,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I think the real issue with VMS and Tru64 support is a matter of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the operating systems don't support most of the inexpensive hardware or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;much hardware without the compaq firmware.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes indeed, you are pretty limited on your bootable/supported hardware for
<BR>
these two OSs.  One big loss is Intraserver which used to provide a much
<BR>
cheaper alternative to Compaq OEM SCSI/Network/Video controllers (including
<BR>
combo cards). Compaq is no longer going to produce drivers or SRM updates
<BR>
the recognize the Intraserver controllers properly, making them effectively
<BR>
&quot;unsupported&quot; which puts your support contract at risk (as well as making it
<BR>
necessary to hack the SRM and driver in order to get it to work, if your not
<BR>
under a support contract but want to run Tru64 or OVMS at home as a
<BR>
hobbyst).
