<P>
With regards to your message at 06:55 PM 4/6/01, Michael Huntingdon. Where 
<BR>
you stated:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;I realize there is a great deal of discussion that goes on within the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;group, specific to pricing of x86, Alpha and others. I've certainly been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wrong before, but I really dislike seeing input such as this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There are many of us that could broadcast our latest and greatest sales
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;promotions, but I don't believe that was the intent or this user group. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should think it far more appropriate to offer this information directly to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;those who have pricing questions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Word gets out quickly when one company or another has a value proposition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to offer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cheers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;~m
</EM><BR>
I apologize if my comment about the 2U case was considered by some as spam.
<BR>
I was only trying to point out that a rack case for Alpha need be no more 
<BR>
expensive than X86.
<BR>
Frankly, with regards to the other posting I think it missed the point that 
<BR>
Kirk was making is very valid. While there will always be older models 
<BR>
available, either through EBay or dealers of refurbs and used computers, 
<BR>
most users who want an Alpha for development want a machine that is vaguely 
<BR>
&quot;state of the art&quot;. Spending money on a machine that does not perform well 
<BR>
by modern standards and has had no BIOS updates for 2 years is not an 
<BR>
adventure for most to embark on.
<BR>
<P>And that is somewhat lacking in todays market.
<BR>
UP1100 is still available for now, and is not a bad machine, other than 
<BR>
lack of memory bandwidth. In the 700MHz variant it is actually fairly speedy.
<BR>
XP1000 and DS10 are decent machines, and reasonably modern. They have good 
<BR>
memory bandwidth, and give up a bit on CPU speed, but not that much when 
<BR>
you realize the fastest clockspeed on a 21264 is still at 833MHz.
<BR>
<P>But if we go back further than that it makes no sense to me. Of course it 
<BR>
all depends on one's expectations, budget and goals..
<BR>
<P>An Athlon at 1.2GHz is a pretty fast machine, and costs around $1500 in 
<BR>
full trim.
<BR>
It will certainly kick an LX or earlier machine in  most significant 
<BR>
benchmarks.
<BR>
The Sun 1105 and Blade were never designed to be speed demons. Just a 
<BR>
decent cheap architecture to run Solaris, with modern hardware support.
<BR>
Ultimately it is often the hardware support list that is the desirable 
<BR>
feature. And on the Alphas to date it has been somewhat problematic. Recent 
<BR>
versions of SRM which added support for TNT2 and 3DLABS Oxygen VX1 cards 
<BR>
have helped enormously in this respect. The prospect of going on another 
<BR>
Easter egg hunt for Elsa Gloria Synergy cards makes me shudder in pain!
<BR>
At least the UP1x00 have supported AGP video for over a year now, and that 
<BR>
helps plenty. As does the onboard ATA66 chip.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, just my $0.01 worth ( that's $0.02 Canadian)
