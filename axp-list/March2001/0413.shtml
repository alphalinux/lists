<P>Back when people cared about machines that had PYXIS chipsets, 512MB
<BR>
dimms didn't exist. By the way, the answer is that there aren't enough
<BR>
address lines for 512MB DIMMs, and that you can't put in 4 256MB DIMMs
<BR>
because the capitance puts it out of spec. At least that's what Compaq
<BR>
engineers told me some time ago when I asked them about the LX. Maybe
<BR>
if you flamed less you'd get better answers?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Note that I wasn't talking about times when SX was developed.

<EM>&gt; This discussion is taking place this week, and there was plently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of time to check that since than.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's an obsolete machine now, and I don't think you gave a good enough
<BR>
reason for people to spend their time checking just for you. And in
<BR>
hindsight, given your flaming, I don't blame them.
