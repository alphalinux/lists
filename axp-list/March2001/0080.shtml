<EM>&gt; How about relaxing the the scope of which SRM decides to support a given

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for example symbios based cards. I never understood why SRM needed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; KNOW the PCI vendor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ID of evert card it wanted to support. Like symbios support, why doesnt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a fireport 40
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; show up? It's symbios based, works fine in linux. Same chipset as some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the older
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;supported&quot; scsi cards though it doesnt show up. Now users who want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get the &quot;SRM supported&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ultra whatever symbios xxxxx SCSI card have no choice but to go to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intraserver and pay their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prices. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Easier said than done.  The drivers in SRM do need to recognise the PCI
<BR>
vendor IDs of SCSI boards in order to support them, but that's not unique
<BR>
to SRM.  Even Linux drivers do this.  Granted, it should be very easy to
<BR>
add vendor IDs for cards that use the same chipsets as the other supported
<BR>
adapters, but it would still need to be done.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; SRM could supply a generic pk driver , gpk if you will. That would try
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and start any host
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; adapter of chipset class X. You get the idea. Adaptec support shouldnt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be a problem at all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to implement. I know Compaq SRM supports the 2940 in DP264 and API's SRM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can support that, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2940U2 ,and the 160. So it's not like the driver support has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; written it just hasnt been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implemented across ALL Alpha platforms. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Are you referring to trying to starting everything of a certain PCI device
<BR>
class or a certain chipset class?  If it's the latter, there's often no
<BR>
way to know what chipset is on a board via PCI probes.  If the former,
<BR>
this definitely wouldn't work in most cases since all SCSI controllers
<BR>
share the same PCI class type (0100).
<BR>
<P>I think the hardest part about doing anything with SCSI BIOS is that, from
<BR>
what I've seen, there's no common way to initialise those cards like there
<BR>
is for vid cards (int10).
