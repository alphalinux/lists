There was a posting in this forum regarding the LinuxBIOS. Might be worth a
<BR>
look.

<P>OpenBoot would be another alternative. It has been a long time since  I
<BR>
looked at the OpenBoot software. At that time although called Open it
<BR>
was Sun propritary.
<BR>
<P>I saw an effort underway to develop an open soucre BIOS for PC's I
<BR>
wonder if any of this could be used?
