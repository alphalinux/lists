<EM>&gt; &gt; The folks at Dec/Compaq have gone from SRM to ARC to AlphaBios and now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sort of back to SRM. The API people are now shipping SRM but it looks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; like they are working on a propritary new boot method.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ummm...not quite. SRM was there the whole time, to boot DU and VMS, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wasn't a progression as you have it. Now....why did people need to boot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux from AlphaBIOS? because at the time many machines didn't come with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SRM...you had to purchase it sepratly (or pay more for the board/machine).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, when NT left Q starting distributing SRM for just about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything (the exception being the XL series) for no charge.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sorry... you are correct SRM has been there all along. I shold have been
<BR>
more clear. As I have worked though various iterations of hardware I
<BR>
have seen a progression of bootloaders.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As for API's product being propriatary, could you please share with me the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information you have regarding this? It's safe, I'm an API employee!
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes I know.
<BR>
I have no hard information. As I said it looks like you are working on
<BR>
somthing new. This is my impression from my view as an outsider. I have
<BR>
been in the hardware/software industry for over 20 years now and have
<BR>
developed a &quot;nose&quot; for things like this. It is not allways correct but
<BR>
is more often than not. YOu could of course state that I am catagoricly
<BR>
wrong and I have no problem with that.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; I have 10 year old PC's that boot the same way that the one I bought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; last week boots. I have 4 generations of Alphas using 5 different boot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; methods. This makes me crazy. I spend far too much time screwing around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with the boot loaders on various machines than I should have to.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yup, and I bet those 10 year old PCs still can't handle a disk over X
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gigabytes, and still can't boot if the kernel's past the 1024 cylinder
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep and the 10yo hardware will not support USB or AGP. But I can stick a
<BR>
linux boot floppy in all of them and have them boot.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; mark etc...etc... I don't know why you boot your Alphas in different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ways...I have 4 alphas and 2 boot methods (ARC-&gt;MILO for the XL and Multia
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and SRM for the SX and LX, the multias flash isn't healthy or I'd have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SRM on it as well).
</EM><BR>
<P>Part of it has to do with licensing. Part is that various boot loaders
<BR>
have various problems. 
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; Since there is not enough alpha hardware being sold to force convergence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to a single boot method I would like to see somthing that is community
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; supported.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That start writing your own....you have that choice.
</EM><BR>
<P>This may be my only choice. I am looking into extending the work that
<BR>
has been done on LinuxBIOS. My feeling at this point is that it may be
<BR>
better to spend my time there than to try and hack milo into shape.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Compaq and API have there own reasons to support and drop support on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; vairous technologies the linux community shold not be limited by these 2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; companies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; To some extent who cares what Compaq and API do. The people running
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; linux on alpha the ability to have a reliable and supported boot loader.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If Compaq and API require magical boot loaders for there OS's then so be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; While I've heard SRM called many things...I don't think magical was ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one of those :)
</EM><BR>
<P>No? Remember, any sufficently advanced technology is indestinguishable
<BR>
from magic :)
