<P>I wondered if we are missing the point here. With the introduction of 3G mobile
<BR>
devices I wondered if we'll be moving away from the traditional desktop machines
<BR>
to something smaller and more portable. Just as we laugh at the brick like
<BR>
mobile phones of a few years ago within 5-10 years or even less people may laugh
<BR>
at the clumsy desk tops we use today. With new technologies such as Transmeta
<BR>
Crusoe, cheaper smaller and solid state disks, and more powerful bus
<BR>
technologies we may find that we have a smaller hand held device that is always
<BR>
connected to the internet and which we carry from the office, home, college and
<BR>
then plug into monitor/keyboard/mouse . The need for more and more powerful
<BR>
desktop processors will be limited except for unique applications such as games
<BR>
(which will be replaced by cheaper consoles). Thus I can see why Compaq is
<BR>
erring towards the Server end for the Alpha where there will still be for a
<BR>
years a healthy market for vms/tru64 and possibly Linux (maybe a market for
<BR>
handhelds here).
