<P>
<EM>&gt; PWS's which shipped in Nov-Dec 97, did not have SRM, This was because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; testing was not completed yet for the SRM/Unix version of the product.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However when the updated firmware was available in very-early 98/very-late
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 97, all PWS's could receive the update and have both consoles present.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only difference between the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;au&quot; are the options offered. an &quot;a&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could be ordered with options only supported by NT.  an &quot;au&quot; could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ordered only with options that would run on all three OS's (NT, Unix and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; VMS)
</EM><BR>
<P>I noticed that my 500a thinks it is a 500a using AlphaBIOS and 500au
<BR>
using SRM.  I prefer SRM.  The only drawback to my 500a is the system
<BR>
doesn't come up if I have the cache board installed.
