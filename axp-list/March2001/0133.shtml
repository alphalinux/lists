<P>
<EM>&gt; In other words do it exactly reverse of now.  I do not see this happening and wearing my 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; business hat, If I spend a bundle on a Tru64 or VMS system I would not appreciate jumping 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hurdles to boot.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree. I &quot;like&quot; SRM. I'm confortable with it and have come to
<BR>
appreciate all the neat
<BR>
things it can do for you. Never is there a &quot;BIOS&quot; I have seen that gives
<BR>
you so much control
<BR>
and does it with as much grace as SRM console does. 
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Currently, you can use SRM to load a secondary bootloader, such as aboot or even MILO.  &gt;Jumping hurdles to boot a free (either way) O/S such as alphalinux, I do not mind.  I really &gt;prefer SRM-aboot, although if SRM could be taught a little about ext2-lin
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes but the kicker here is you have to load that secondary bootloader
<BR>
from an SRM supported
<BR>
device. So unless you always want to load firmware X off a floppy (which
<BR>
isnt the most reliable
<BR>
medium in the world) you're back to square one. Loading a secondary bl
<BR>
into the flash
<BR>
simply isnt an option for the non AlphaServer class machine that have
<BR>
only 1MB of flash.
<BR>
Things like AS800's, 1200's, DP264, and UP2000 have 2MB flash. I don't
<BR>
forsee myself
<BR>
or other AL users doing what the LinuxBIOS or openbios guys did and cut
<BR>
off flash chips to replace it higher capacity flash...
<BR>
<P>EXT2 support in SRM is nice but whats stopping SRM from loading linux
<BR>
off a FAT fs of which
<BR>
it already understands? That and I'm assuming that the EXT2
<BR>
implementation is GPL so it's not
<BR>
like Compaq is going to drop it in to SRM. They would have to either
<BR>
reverse engineer it from
<BR>
spec or borrow an alternative implimentation that has a BSD'sh license.
<BR>
Does FBSD support EXT2?
<BR>
Actually, looking at the aboot CVS tree. It doesnt look like it &quot;has&quot; a
<BR>
license so possibly
<BR>
ext2 support and the boostrap implementation could be implemented in
<BR>
SRM???
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Most of the complaints about SRM I see are about it not supporting certain hardware.  These &gt;fall into three categories: graphics, HBA and network.  Network cards: Most people do not boot &gt;from the network so I do not see this as a current crisis.  Most ca
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; HBAs (host bus adaptors, scsi cards):This is the most critical area IMO to support.  It also &gt;covers the largest base of demand IMO.  Without support for a scsi card you can not boot from &gt;it.  Although you can get around it in some cases, load a secondary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Graphics:This is probably the second largest base of demand IMO, although it's also probably &gt;the loudest.   A lot of us run headless, or use our systems as servers in which case having &gt;anything beyond basic video support is low on our list.  However, more
</EM><BR>
<P>If I could drill it into people's head to use BOOTP as their primary
<BR>
boostrap method 
<BR>
this discussion wouldnt have half the urgency it presents since the #1
<BR>
killer here
<BR>
is not being able to boot off host adapter X. Again, I'm assuming here
<BR>
that majority of
<BR>
people have small private networks with a DHCP server. It's not like you
<BR>
can't
<BR>
get a SRM support ethernet device, Any intel nic will do. I wish 3Com
<BR>
worked as well
<BR>
but ho hum. 
<BR>
<P>I agree that the host adapter list is way too short and wish it could be
<BR>
extended.
<BR>
Problem is from a engineering POV. If you just added X new features to
<BR>
SRM console you now have X regression tests to set guidelines for and
<BR>
implement.
<BR>
Else you document what you did, make an errata, and call the software an
<BR>
unsupported
<BR>
BETA. Both require some amount of engineering resources but before that
<BR>
there would
<BR>
need to be a concensus from managment to implement one of the projects
<BR>
to begin with.
<BR>
<P>Video support would be a &quot;nice thing&quot;. It's not a need per say but those
<BR>
of us with 3
<BR>
year old LX's who don't have the ching to spend on a UP1K &quot;just&quot; to get
<BR>
a AGP graphics
<BR>
card is unreasonable. Especially so since there hasnt been an
<BR>
&quot;affordable&quot; Alpha in the price/value market since the SX and that
<BR>
was... almost 3 years ago. A new bios emulator
<BR>
would let folks able to go out and get the PCI Radeon cards ,Oxygen GVX1
<BR>
cards (which X
<BR>
has yet to support AFAIK), and IBM's fireGL 1 (has that been released
<BR>
yet?). Short list yes
<BR>
but the list is too short as it stands already. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I have probably rambled too much.
</EM><BR>
<P>You think you where rambling?
<BR>
it's a good thing sometimes :-)
