<P>
<EM>&gt; The folks at Dec/Compaq have gone from SRM to ARC to AlphaBios and now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sort of back to SRM. The API people are now shipping SRM but it looks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like they are working on a propritary new boot method.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ummm...not quite. SRM was there the whole time, to boot DU and VMS, it
<BR>
wasn't a progression as you have it. Now....why did people need to boot
<BR>
Linux from AlphaBIOS? because at the time many machines didn't come with
<BR>
SRM...you had to purchase it sepratly (or pay more for the board/machine).
<BR>
However, when NT left Q starting distributing SRM for just about
<BR>
everything (the exception being the XL series) for no charge.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
As for API's product being propriatary, could you please share with me the
<BR>
information you have regarding this? It's safe, I'm an API employee!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have 10 year old PC's that boot the same way that the one I bought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; last week boots. I have 4 generations of Alphas using 5 different boot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; methods. This makes me crazy. I spend far too much time screwing around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the boot loaders on various machines than I should have to. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup, and I bet those 10 year old PCs still can't handle a disk over X
<BR>
gigabytes, and still can't boot if the kernel's past the 1024 cylinder
<BR>
mark etc...etc... I don't know why you boot your Alphas in different
<BR>
ways...I have 4 alphas and 2 boot methods (ARC-&gt;MILO for the XL and Multia
<BR>
and SRM for the SX and LX, the multias flash isn't healthy or I'd have
<BR>
SRM on it as well).
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Since there is not enough alpha hardware being sold to force convergence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to a single boot method I would like to see somthing that is community
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supported.
</EM><BR>
<P>That start writing your own....you have that choice.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Compaq and API have there own reasons to support and drop support on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vairous technologies the linux community shold not be limited by these 2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; companies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To some extent who cares what Compaq and API do. The people running
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; linux on alpha the ability to have a reliable and supported boot loader.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If Compaq and API require magical boot loaders for there OS's then so be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it.
</EM><BR>
<P>While I've heard SRM called many things...I don't think magical was ever
<BR>
one of those :)
