Hi Kirk,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A good point.  I suppose the justification is that the size of the driver
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is used for a bootable device must be a very small footprint,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increasing the generality (wrapping a range of chipsets across SCSI 1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; through SCSI 3 for example) would no doubt increase the size and complexity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the driver, which would also increase regression testing and further
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; delay releases (the Compaq Party line). Given that 4, 8 and 16MB flash
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; EEPROM parts have gotten quite cheap (mirroring the trend in more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conventional SDRAM), it would at least be practical to increase the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; footprint of the console footprint from the 1MB or less to something with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; larger device support.  Lengthened development time (assuming no significant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increase in the number of engineers allocated) would of course apply.
</EM><BR>
<P>Jeez. a 4MB flash would be ideal. Room for a flash console, SRM, and two maybe
<BR>
three kernels.  As for the SRM pk driver. There are already hooks in SRM to 
<BR>
start/stop drivers by using init.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;init -driver pk 
<BR>
<P>will reload the pk driver. usefull if you're hot swapping drives. 
<BR>
this entry point could be used to pass bus information to notify
<BR>
the pk driver of a device not in it's list.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; API has started placing Linux in &quot;ROM,&quot; but I have not played with this to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see how flexible the bootable configurations can be made as opposed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traditional console firmware. Its a good concept in any case. Other options
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exist as well (OpenBoot in particular) and are open source.
</EM><BR>
<P>So should one look to download OB source code? I'd like to see what it's all
<BR>
about.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; PALcode is the biggest sticking point all the way around. Alpha architecture
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; requires it, so he who controls the PALcode and SRM licenses controls all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have never been able to get a good answer out of Samsung/API whether their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free reign over Alpha architecture permits them similar access to SRM and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; PALcode, I would only assume so.
</EM><BR>
<P>Samsung/API are not the one to ask. Compaq holds all the licenses AFAIK.
<BR>
