Hi Folks,
<BR>
<P>Here is where I'm at in fighting with the RAID problem on my system.
<BR>
<P>To recap:  It is an API UP2000 system with an adaptec 2940 U2/W
<BR>
controller with an IBM boot disk and two Seagate 73 GB drives combined
<BR>
in RAID0 stripe.  It had RH 7.0 installed, with kernel version
<BR>
2.2.14-6.0smp.  The system would hang after a lot of activities to the
<BR>
RAID partition (/dev/md0).
<BR>
<P>I have been advised that the kernel and disk drivers probably have bugs,
<BR>
and are therefore causing the system hangs.  I downloaded the 2.2.17
<BR>
kernel package from alphalinux.org, and after a few iterations, was able
<BR>
to get a kernel that would almost boot.  It gets to a point where it's
<BR>
trying to start the RAID, and an error occurs.  The only messages I get
<BR>
are:
<BR>
<P>*error occurred during RAID startup
<BR>
*check syslog and /proc/mdstat for more information
<BR>
<P>and then it prompts for root password to log into single user mode.
<BR>
At this time, the /var partition has not yet been mounted, so I do
<BR>
not find anything in messages file regarding this, and /proc/mdstat
<BR>
has only the following:
<BR>
<P>Personalities: [2 raid0]
<BR>
read_ahead not set
<BR>
md0: inactive
<BR>
md1: inactive
<BR>
md2: inactive
<BR>
md3: inactive
<BR>
<P>This is my first attempt at building LINUX, but I think I selected all
<BR>
the right support options from make xconfig.  If I exclude the MD
<BR>
drivers, the system boots up, but I obviously can not access the RAID.
<BR>
Is there something else that's going on that i need to fix?
<BR>
<P>thanks in advance for any assistance.
<BR>
