<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; EXT2 support in SRM is nice but whats stopping SRM from loading linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; off a FAT fs of which it already understands?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I thought SRM did not understand filesystems.  I thought it knew
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; enough about a device to pull physical blocks of media into memory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and execute the code from there... that's why aboot was written to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; read the ext2 partition and load the kernel.(?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It understand filesystems, but doesn't understand partition tables...if I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remember correctly. After all it can read a FAT floppy, or an iso9660 or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; UFS CDROM.
</EM><BR>
<P>Good point.  I hadn't thought about it that way.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&lt;snip&gt; 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Well, how about _removing_ some of the more esoteric features of SRM to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; stand-alone executables.  I'm talking about things like memexer, isacfg,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; etc. that are nice but take up space and you don't need them to boot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the machine all the time.  ARC/AlphaBIOS was good for this as it had a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; SDK that you can program with your own add-ons  (ARCDOS being one example).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The executables could be loaded from disk or floppy.  If those features
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; could be moved out of SRM and still being accessable (say on a bootable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; CD) for those that need it, then you could put more enhancments into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the base SRM.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hey....wait a minute here....you may not use those commands, that doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mean that other don't.
</EM><BR>
<P>Please reread that paragraph again.  While I suggested some commands could
<BR>
be removed from the ROM image to make space, I also suggested that the
<BR>
removed commands still remain accessible via some kind of executable
<BR>
format on CDROM or floppy.  That way no one loses. :)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I know you can't please everyone all the time.  And I know it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; does boil down to money at some point.  It's too bad that at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for video that the emulator couldn't be seperated from the console
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in some way so people with old machines could at least update the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; emulator.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's an interesting idea....seperating the emulator binary from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SRM. Don't know it it's possible or not...they may be to tightly coupled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for this to happen.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks.:)  I don't know how feasible it is either.  Hindsight is
<BR>
always 20/20.
