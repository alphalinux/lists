<EM>&gt; &gt; Agreed. Though like you said, these machines run UNIX not windows.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, my machines up til last year or so ran NT fairly regularly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (I've kicked my Lightwave habit for the moment...)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The LX164 and PC64 and other machines were sold as &quot;dual booters&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You could run NT, Tru64 and even OpenVMS on a bunch of them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It's not an excuse to cop out of having a nice BIOS setup your hardware
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and bootstrap your box.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Agreed.  I think this is why AlphaBIOS came into being.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It was step in the right direction.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't fully understand why milo was needed to begin with.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If it was all just to switch palcode and mess with some registers then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; why couldnt ARC/AB be extend to use that PAL and do the setup required and your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; off. The only thing you would care about is passing cli arguments and you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; already could do that with ARC/AB.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Good Question.  I've never dug into that one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One would guess that Linus' and/or DEC's original port may have attempted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to use the PALcode in the ARC firmware.  I've been trying to recall if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BLADE was developed on a SRM box or not.... Since SRM was being sold
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seperately back then, MILO may have been a stopgap measure so people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; did not have to pay extra to run a (semi-)free OS.  They may have had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ARC issues so something more SRM-like was substituted???
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Could also be ARC was centered around a certain 32-bit OS and did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not &quot;fully&quot; support 64-bitness?
</EM><BR>
<P>ARC like SRM only works to the extent that that they support the OS and
<BR>
disk formats they were designed for. SRM uses OSF disklabels and
<BR>
partitions. ARC uses DOS/Win formats. Milo was a way to get from the
<BR>
linload.exe and DOS/Win format executable to the point where a elf or
<BR>
a.out could be booted off an ext2 format partition.
<BR>
<P>The folks at Dec/Compaq have gone from SRM to ARC to AlphaBios and now
<BR>
sort of back to SRM. The API people are now shipping SRM but it looks
<BR>
like they are working on a propritary new boot method.
<BR>
<P>I have 10 year old PC's that boot the same way that the one I bought
<BR>
last week boots. I have 4 generations of Alphas using 5 different boot
<BR>
methods. This makes me crazy. I spend far too much time screwing around
<BR>
with the boot loaders on various machines than I should have to. 
<BR>
<P>Since there is not enough alpha hardware being sold to force convergence
<BR>
to a single boot method I would like to see somthing that is community
<BR>
supported.
<BR>
Compaq and API have there own reasons to support and drop support on
<BR>
vairous technologies the linux community shold not be limited by these 2
<BR>
companies.
<BR>
<P>To some extent who cares what Compaq and API do. The people running
<BR>
linux on alpha the ability to have a reliable and supported boot loader.
<BR>
If Compaq and API require magical boot loaders for there OS's then so be
<BR>
it.
