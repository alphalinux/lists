<P>
Adrie,
<BR>
<P>I've had similar problems on both Digital PWS 600au and 164LX systems
<BR>
(running &quot;equivalent&quot; SRM, PWS is numbered differently). I think there are
<BR>
some driver issues with some revs of the SCSI controller, something I
<BR>
thought 1.1 would fix. 
<BR>
I have QLA 1040B and QLA 1040C as the boot controllers in these systems,
<BR>
fairly well supported hardware.  I think your 1000A has a IQ 1020 or IQ
<BR>
1020A (or perhaps the Symbios 53825J, don't recall), which should still be a
<BR>
supported device.  I ended up using a spare SCSI controller to get the
<BR>
Jumpstart to work (an IQ 1020) in both systems with the CDROM on one
<BR>
controller and the boot disk on the 1040B/C.  I'm not sure at all why this
<BR>
worked, termination and IDs were set  correctly in both cases and SRM was
<BR>
able to identify and test the devices correctly in both configurations.  If
<BR>
you have a spare supported SCSI controller (older Ultra and Fast SCSI 2
<BR>
controllers like the QLA 1040, IQ 1020, Symbios Logic 53C825, 53C875), I'd
<BR>
advise trying to segment your devices and re-verify proper termination for
<BR>
your CD-ROM and disk drives on their separate SCSI buses.  It's possible
<BR>
that the JumpStart makes assumptions about what SCSI controller your CD-ROM
<BR>
should be on or what SCSI IDs you should have set by default.  As the CD-ROM
<BR>
does a good amount of auto detection for your hardware, I'm still at a loss
<BR>
to explain what appears to be fairly common behavior.  If anyone within
<BR>
Compaq's development team for Jumpstart is on the list, perhaps they can
<BR>
shed some light on this.  I will send a query directly with my errors and
<BR>
post to the list.
<BR>

Subject: Jumpstart problem Digital Alpha 1000A 5/300
<BR>
<P><P>Harware: Digital aplha server 1000A 5/300
<BR>
Jumpstart version : 1.1
<BR>
Linux: Redhet version 7.0
<BR>
Bios version : 5.70
<BR>
<P>I'm trying to install Redhet Linux 7.0 on this machine, when i start the 
<BR>
jumpstart cd ( boot dka400 -fl 0) it boots the cd and starts loading driver 
<BR>
etc, but after detecting a scsi cd rom drive the system stops.
<BR>
Does jump start work on an &quot;old&quot; 1000A 5/300 system?
<BR>
