<EM>&gt; Sorry, but you've been given bum info.

<EM>&gt; I have 16 years experience of dealing with SCSI, coupled with writing both OS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drivers and device firmware.  In all that time I've never come across a device
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that has failed a FORMAT UNIT command
</EM><BR>
....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Most devices do support various block sizes (I don't recall off-hand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which commands are used to inquire as to what is supported, but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think it's READ BLOCK LIMITS).  However, if you do successfully format
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a drive with 1024 or 2048 byte blocks (sectors) don't be surprised if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your OS freaks out, as it has to be coded explicitly to deal with that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; block size.
</EM><BR>
<P>Years ago when I got myself for NeXT machine a WREN full height SCSI
<BR>
drive with a whopping 700 MB, or so, capacity (it still works even it is
<BR>
not in use right now) I immediately changed its block size to 1024.
<BR>
This was a popular move on NeXT, and tools for that were readily
<BR>
available, as a drive after such change was performing better and was
<BR>
gaining an extra usable capacity and one would not have to worry about
<BR>
some legacy junk from M$.  Quite a bit later I added there a Quantum
<BR>
drive (it died some year ago).  You could try to change on it a sector
<BR>
size and that command was not failing but also it was not doing anything
<BR>
useful.  A sector size on that drive was hardwired to 512 bytes because
<BR>
this is what &quot;everybody&quot; is using.  Right?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm not sure if linux has any such provisions.
</EM><BR>
<P>BTW - Linux can mount this WREN if a support for a proper variant of UFS
<BR>
is present in a kernel so, apparently, it is not fazed by its sector
<BR>
size.:-)
