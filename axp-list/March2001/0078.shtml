Hello,
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; If we can get a very small list of adapters everyone thinks are critical to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha Linux acceptance, maybe a business case could be made.  Maybe not, I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know.  I know that everyone wants 2940 adapters to be supported (the 39160s
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already are under 5.8, maybe earlier), how about video cards - what's the #1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; video card everyone wants to be able to use that doesn't already work?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Remember, the latest SRM is 5.8.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe instead of a small list of adapter cards that alpha/linux uses
<BR>
want/need to use.
<BR>
How about relaxing the the scope of which SRM decides to support a given
<BR>
type of card,
<BR>
for example symbios based cards. I never understood why SRM needed to
<BR>
KNOW the PCI vendor
<BR>
ID of evert card it wanted to support. Like symbios support, why doesnt
<BR>
a fireport 40
<BR>
show up? It's symbios based, works fine in linux. Same chipset as some
<BR>
of the older
<BR>
&quot;supported&quot; scsi cards though it doesnt show up. Now users who want to
<BR>
get the &quot;SRM supported&quot;
<BR>
Ultra whatever symbios xxxxx SCSI card have no choice but to go to
<BR>
intraserver and pay their
<BR>
prices. 
<BR>
<P>SRM could supply a generic pk driver , gpk if you will. That would try
<BR>
and start any host
<BR>
adapter of chipset class X. You get the idea. Adaptec support shouldnt
<BR>
be a problem at all
<BR>
to implement. I know Compaq SRM supports the 2940 in DP264 and API's SRM
<BR>
can support that, the
<BR>
2940U2 ,and the 160. So it's not like the driver support has been
<BR>
written it just hasnt been
<BR>
implemented across ALL Alpha platforms. 
<BR>
<P>As for video cards what I would really like to see is support for ATI's
<BR>
RADEON and 3Dlab's
<BR>
GVX1 GLINT based cards. Both are avalable in PCI though I'm told the
<BR>
current bios emulator
<BR>
in v5.8 doesnt support it. As for exisitng options for video cards there
<BR>
are ATI rage 128's, rage pro's,
<BR>
voodoo 2000,3000, Nvidia TNT2, and Matrox G200. From the traffic on the
<BR>
DRI lists I don't see a great future in maintaining driver support for
<BR>
voodoo 4x and 5x. That and with Nvidia buying 3dFX I don't see them
<BR>
continuing to sell the older V3 line. So that short list will get even
<BR>
shorter... 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I just want to be clear here - I'm not promising anything personally, and I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certainly not promising anything from Compaq.  I'm just saying that a little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organized thinking about what is the most important might get us a little closer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to what people are looking for in the next rev. or two.  It will certainly get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; us closer than just complaining. ;)
</EM><BR>
<P>:-)
