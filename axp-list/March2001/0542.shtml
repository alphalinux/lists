<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; GeForce have bootable support thanks to their 32 bit extended VGA BIOS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; routines and lack of support in most OSes that Alpha supports. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;SRM 5.9 has an updated BIOS emulator that can handle Radeon, TNT2 (5.8 can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;can that one), don't know about GeForce.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Where can I find a list of systems (particularly API systems) supported by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the SRM 5.9 update? Is the UP2000+ one of the systems with the new SRM? How
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much of the porting effort did API have to perform for its own inhouse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; designs?
</EM><BR>
<P>5.9 will be released for UP2000[+] in the future, 5.8 is in beta and
<BR>
should be final soon. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Ummm...not quite. API's Linux in ROM is not based on the OpenBIOS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;project.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is the project entirely in-house, or did you outsource some of the work?
</EM><BR>
<P>In house.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Boards that don't have FSB usually have DBM (debug Monitor) which can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;used to repair flash images, not as easy to use as FSB though.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Does the CS20 have FSB, DBM, or both?
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually......it has AlphaDiags which is API's firmware recovery tools,
<BR>
based on DBM, but a little more user friendly.
