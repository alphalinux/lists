&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the real issue with VMS and Tru64 support is a matter of
<BR>
the operating systems don't support most of the inexpensive hardware or
<BR>
much hardware without the compaq firmware.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think it would be important to make the Board 100% standard ATX
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complient so that any ATX case can be used. Make the board available to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system resellers!  This will allow whoever produces the board to have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; higher production run because the same board would be used in internally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; produced machines as well as sold to vendors. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps a smaller power supply requirement?  250w?  I'd like to see future
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boards not quite so power thirsty.  Just a thought :)  VMS compat. isn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as critical in this product IMHO.  If some savings can be had while by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sacrificing VMS support that may be ok.  I'd say the next step up in price
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; VMS becomes more important.......just a thought.  Although if VMS support
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can be kept then &quot;hurray!&quot;

<EM>&gt; &gt; 	700 MHz EV68 or EV69 CPU/4MB DDR HSTL cache in either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; non-upgradeable &quot;soldered on&quot; or upgradeable socketted configuration 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 	AMD IG-4 761 chipset (VIA chipset may become a viable option also)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 	256MB 184 pin PC266 DDR SDRAM, 4 sockets (2GB max using 512MB
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; unbuffered ECC modules)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The important thing is to use memory that is pretty standard and cheap.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; With ALPHA's RISC design memory is probably more important than clock
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speed for many applications.  The ability to expand memory cheaply 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gives these MB's a chance to live a LONG life.  This is attractive for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; educational buyers who generally have a longer product replacement cycle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than many corporations (5-7 years opposed to  3-5)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Nvidia GeForce 3 MPU, AGP 4x (integrated as a soldered on AGP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; device, no AGP slot is provided) with 32MB DDR
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd substitute &quot;Any GOOD 3d AGP chipset that has at least 24mb of on board
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; video ram and is currently supported by true64 and Linux&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 	Single port Intel 82559 Fast Ethernet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again substitute &quot;Any on board 10/100 ethernet but it MUST be supported by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; True 64 and Linux&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 	ALi Southbridge I/O chip
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 	ATA-100 support (via ALi southbridge, treated as a SCSI controller
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; by the SRM console)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 	Integrated USB, IrDA wireless, parallel, dual 9 pin serial, PS/2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; keyboard and mouse ports (via ALi southbridge)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 	Integrated PC97 accelerated audio (also via ALi southbridge) for 16
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bit, 48KHz stereo audio
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 	Integrated dual port TI IEEE 1394c &quot;Firewire&quot; for external devices
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   	1 64 bit PCI slot supporting 66MHz 3.3 volt operation, isolated from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; internal PCI bus (where the Firewire, ATA-100 and 	Fast Ethernet stem).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To this I would add a single 32 bit PCI slot also (maybe 2) Just so there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is SOME room for expansion in the future.  ATA 100 support is important,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and a ATA chipset whose BIOS can be upgraded later (ATA 133?) on might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also be useful (we are all dreaming here, so cut me some slack on this one :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; There are of course several technical issues to overcome: Firmware console,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; SROM and operating system/SRM drivers would have to be written more or less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; from scratch, to name just a few items. The system described here does bear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Couldn't we use LINUX in flash the way API is now?  This may/would save
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; development time, and I'm quite sure you could teach linux to load Tru 64
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unix.  Since this is aimed at the lower end keeping the development costs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; down is important.  Also the ability to be able to correctly identify
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; future hardware that is plugged into the thing should be easier. (Grab the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; source recompile linux firmware xxx and load it up) The ability to use a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more &quot;open sourced&quot; firmware loader has been discussed here before.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think it may have a good fit in the praticulair application.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also DEC was pretty darn smart with the fail safe boot loader available on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many Alpha motherboards.  I would say with the market that this is aimed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at (hobbiest and people that like to poke around) any motherboard produced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should have this option.  MANY an intel based board has had to be sent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; back because a flash bios upgrade failed.  So far EVERY alpha I own (6 of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them) has been able to recover from a failed BIOS updates.
