<EM>&gt; &gt; So could this explain why my 2.4 series kernels always lock up on my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; alpha?  If I didn't have a zillion things due yesterday, or the day before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'd be digging through the kernel mailing list.  Thought others on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; list would get some use out of this.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Its pretty much a dead duck on the UP1100; and not much better on UP2000.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I haven't seen the UP1100 patch posted here make it into a release yet;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and aic7xxx was wonky/qlogicfc unuseable on UP2000.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To be fair, I haven't tried 2.4.3, but there's already a few reported
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've had _far_ better luck (alpha and x86) using the the 2.4.x-ac branch.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<P>I saw one reported problem and I reproduced it.  Basically you cannot
<BR>
build 2.4.3 on Alpha.  It seems like there was some changes in syntax
<BR>
for pte_alloc and pmd_alloc (I think) and the prototypes done match
<BR>
in different places.
<BR>
<P>I have not had luck with 2.4.2 on Alpha (SMP ES40).  Writing big files over 
<BR>
NFS will cause the system to hang.   Error messages on the console indicate 
<BR>
more of an SMP problem than NFS per se, but I don't have them written down
<BR>
here to post them.
<BR>
<P>I am having a lot better success with 2.2.19 with the ES40s.  I have
<BR>
some UP2000s, but I plan to stick with 2.2.XX for them.  
<BR>
<P>What qlogicfc drivers have you tried?  I think that the qlogic driver
<BR>
in the kernel is from UNH.  Qlogic has their own driver that seems to
<BR>
have been improving for Alpha.  It (v4.24) even compiles cleanly for
<BR>
alpha now and from my (limited) tests doesn't corrupt data.  However
<BR>
I have not tried this under 2.4, but it seems that they have been focusing
<BR>
their development there and not on 2.2.  There is also a driver at 
<BR>
www.feral.com for a FC driver for linux.   I don't know how it plays
<BR>
with 2.4 though.
