<P>
Maurice,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Intraserver is still around, and their cards are still available.
</EM><BR>
<P>I did not intend to imply they had gone belly-up.  I still buy gear from
<BR>
them for my Sun/SPARCengine hardware. I probably should have stated that
<BR>
better.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What HAS changed is that for U160 SCSI3 support Compaq opted to go with
</EM><BR>
Adaptec. Good news is availability, bad news ( in my &gt;opinion) is that
<BR>
Adaptec sucks.
<BR>
<P>Couldn't agree with you more. I remember stories from sysadmins running
<BR>
first generation DS20s and complaining bitterly about the onboard Adaptec
<BR>
AIC 7895, someone else told me the DP264's first rev had simililar issues
<BR>
that made the onboard Adaptec SCSI &quot;unusable.&quot;  In both cases, they
<BR>
installed Qlogic 1040Bs or LSI Logic 53C895 based controllers just to
<BR>
provide themselves with a bootable configuration. 
<BR>
<P>Since Compaq appears to be consolidating options internally between some of
<BR>
its server/workstations, even across the Intel/Alpha product lines, I guess
<BR>
it makes sense in some ways that they should standardize on Adaptec across
<BR>
the board for U160 and presumably U230.  I was not aware that the transition
<BR>
point was limited to Intraserver's U2(Fast-40) HBAs. I think LSI Logic and
<BR>
Qlogic still have the high-end for FibreChannel stuff, but I no longer know
<BR>
what Compaq is doing about host-based RAID. Do you know if Mylex still a
<BR>
player (if only in the StorageWorks division), or have they started using
<BR>
their own rather mediocre SMART series of RAID controllers on some of the
<BR>
Alpha systems instead? The way these parts are identified and labeled, the
<BR>
only way you can tell who OEMed what is to download their drivers and tech
<BR>
detail sheets to figure out what came from where. In both cases (SMART RAID
<BR>
controllers, Adaptec SCSI controllers) I think they have opted for
<BR>
technically inferior components for the sake of simplification and possibly
<BR>
wholesale/implementation costs.  The end user will probably never see any
<BR>
benefit passed on in price, and probably will have to endure the growing
<BR>
pains and idiosyncrasies of another vendors wares on their boxes.  The
<BR>
original point of this post was to determine a basic low cost config, but
<BR>
whether Compaq uses Qlogic, LSI Logic, Mylex or Adaptec, nothing they
<BR>
release to the public will be cheaper one way or another.  They have a
<BR>
vested interest in milking the platform as hard as they can, they'll
<BR>
probably never be a source of practical, desirable low cost Alpha systems.
<BR>
<P>I tend to think that by the time you get to really NEEDING U160 (Fast-80)
<BR>
you're probably at a point where considering FibreChannel is a good option,
<BR>
but this is still limited to the high end.  You need a backplane to
<BR>
translate the serial optical/serial copper into the SCA-1 (40 pin) connector
<BR>
FibreChannel drives use.  &quot;FireWire&quot; drives and devices using the Sony IEEE
<BR>
1394 compatible &quot;iLink&quot; do not require any form of backplane.  For shear
<BR>
cheapness, IEEE 1394 is going to be the obvious transition point from
<BR>
parallel SCSI, its the same SCSI 3 protocol, can use devices which have
<BR>
fairly small adaptations made to accommodate serial signaling, is inherently
<BR>
hot swappable, auto-addressing and auto-terminating (similar to
<BR>
FibreChannel). If you could forgo the ATA-100 spec today with a practical,
<BR>
low cost storage subsystem consisting only of FireWire devices, you could
<BR>
eliminate quite a bit of legacy hardware and clean up the airflow inside of
<BR>
the case, even a small form factor case. For now, FireWire is still not
<BR>
mainstream enough to build an inexpensive Alpha box without also having ATA
<BR>
or some form of parallel SCSI to attach the CD-ROM and main hard drive to.
<BR>
<P><P>Thanks for commenting Maurice.
