<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I believe that's due to Linux not supporting certain kernel functions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that the Tru64 kernel has and the threads library is looking for them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Basicly Tru64 kernel's threading archtitecure is fully POSIX compliant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where Linux's kernel threading system only implements part of the POSIX
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; standard. I don't think we'll ever see full POSIX threads support in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kernel, Linus has said himself that he hates POSIX threads and they suck.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux's kernel threading system act more like lightmweight processes than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything else.

The True64(3.2) has 3 and possibly more syscall layers. The first
<BR>
problem is that linux does not break these out. This would be an easy
<BR>
change to make to the kernel to allow the seperation into multiple call
<BR>
handlers. I put a proposal to Compaq to make a few minor changes there
<BR>
and then it would be possible to create a few modules that could be
<BR>
loaded into the system to allow for complete execution of True64 code.
<BR>
(Think iBCS).
<BR>
<P>For what It's worth I am not sure that the linuxthreads implemtation is
<BR>
all that solid. I found a number of places where MySQL would break that
<BR>
seem to be realated to thread creation and mmap. But I have been assuerd
<BR>
by the linuxthreads maintainers that I am stupid and this could not be
<BR>
the case ;)
