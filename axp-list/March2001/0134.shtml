What about adapting the Bochs x86 CPU emulator (<A HREF="http://www.bochs.com">http://www.bochs.com</A>) to work
<BR>
in place of the &quot;alternative&quot; x86 emulator that has source code in the MILO
<BR>
package?  This could be a good starting point as it does boot win9x and can
<BR>
emulate a Pentium to some degree.

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Because the source for MILO is generaly available and it is based on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; linux kernel, new drivers can be added reasonably easly. For the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; reason bugs can be fixed when they crop up.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The source is available yes, and several people continue to work on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it. However, the x86 emulator included with it is binary only and guessing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; from its age, will do no better than older SRMs with newer video cards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; etc....I suppose if somebody wanted to they may be able to use the x86
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; emulator that the XFree86 guys use, but I'd imagine this to be a major
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; undertaking.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What is the current version of SRM using? Would it not be possible to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get a more current x86 emulator from the previous source. On the other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hand other than bugs I don't think the x86 instruction set has changed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the last few years.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; MILO has some problems with setting up some motherboards. The usual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; answer I get to questions about MILO are &quot;well just use SRM it is there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; and works&quot;.  I think this discussion is evidence that althought SRM is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; there it does not allways work.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Would it not be worth the while of the Alpha community to try and find a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; single boot loader and get it working with all the various motherboards.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Somthing that the community as a whole can support. Right now there are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; at least 4 different loaders with various levels of support.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Also there's no EV6 support in MILO, so that would have to be added, and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; think MILOs only value in this case is when it could be flashed into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ROM, replacing AlphaBIOS/SRM. If you're just starting it from ARC then I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; really don't see any advantage.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes MILO needs some work. The issue is to have a single boot loader that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can be loaded into flash and supported. Right now you can have 5
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; diffrent versions of motherboards with 6 different boot loaders.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have nothing against SRM. It is just that I would like to see a single
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supportable method for booting linux on alpha not the current cooks tour
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of boot loader technology.
