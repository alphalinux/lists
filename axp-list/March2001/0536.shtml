<P>
Aaron,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'd thought I'd share some comments, mostly in regards to the first system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you set out as I think this is the most viable option.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks for your comments. I'll respond inline.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I think it would be important to make the Board 100% standard ATX
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;complient so that any ATX case can be used. Make the board available to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;system resellers!  This will allow whoever produces the board to have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;higher production run because the same board would be used in internally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;produced machines as well as sold to vendors. 
</EM><BR>
<P>With solder-on and conventional sockets, you do sometimes require a larger
<BR>
board to accommodate the CPU/cache, the system chipset, and any add-on
<BR>
STP/QFP ASICs for such things as the Southbridge functions (usually the PCI
<BR>
to ISA bridge, I/O controller for UARTs, parallel, USB, ATA and sometimes
<BR>
audio), network, SCSI, etc. I've seen some fairly massive ATX 2.0 compliant
<BR>
motherboards that still manage to make room for a massive CPU/cooling
<BR>
assembly/power management-VRM and still have room for 6 PCI slots, 1 ISA
<BR>
slot and have all the bells and whistles of audio, network, SCSI, etc. all
<BR>
built onto the board. It can be done, its a question of how much time would
<BR>
be spent on a low-cost volume part, especially if it was just a testbed and
<BR>
not specifically targeting any one market or purpose.  I'm not entirely
<BR>
convinced that the UP1500 isn't more of a political move by Samsung than a
<BR>
real product per se.  API should be making motherboards, not Samsung. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Perhaps a smaller power supply requirement?  250w?  I'd like to see future
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;boards not quite so power thirsty.  Just a thought :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Power demands are going up, not down.  You can implement power-save modes,
<BR>
but you need soft-power support in the OS. One of the hardest things Tadpole
<BR>
ever did was get rudimentary power management support working in the
<BR>
Alphabook 1 running OpenVMS 7.1. For safety reasons, you are always better
<BR>
off with a higher rated power supply, 300 watt should be considered the
<BR>
minimum for an Alpha system (the 164LX with a 600MHz CPU and 256MB of RAM
<BR>
uses about 110 watts, all by itself.  Add the load of a couple of 10,000
<BR>
SCSI drives and you end up with a minimal requirement of about 150-180
<BR>
watts, and that's without a high-power video controller that may need 15-50
<BR>
watts itself. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;VMS compat. isn't as critical in this product IMHO.  If some savings can be
</EM><BR>
had while by sacrificing VMS support that may be &gt;ok.  I'd say the next step
<BR>
up in price VMS becomes more important.......just a thought.  Although if
<BR>
VMS support can be kept &gt;then &quot;hurray!&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;From a practical perspective, the issues may be too complex and involve too
</EM><BR>
many legal issues to be practical.  There is also the issue of modularity;
<BR>
Compaq wants to sell you a &quot;solution&quot; when they hear you asking for an
<BR>
Alpha-something-or-other. Compaq is tightening the screws on vendors who can
<BR>
build OpenVMS and Tru64 compatible hardware, it wants to sell all of it
<BR>
without having to share the pie. If the only OS that need be supported is
<BR>
Linux, then you can even forgo SRM and boostrap directly into Linux from
<BR>
SROM and eliminate another license or development expense.  I suggested a
<BR>
config for OpenVMS and Tru64 support solely because shops still need some
<BR>
small test boxes and training on big iron is not practical. Perhaps that is
<BR>
another battle for the DECUS groups to fight, fair enough.  
<BR>
<P>Sun understands the need for lower-end machines and IBM is also coming to
<BR>
its senses.  Compaq is moving in the opposite direction and trying to make
<BR>
Alpha a key differentiator with the traditional profit margins for a
<BR>
proprietary RISC design with three (Tandem's Non-Stop is going Alpha native
<BR>
within 24 months) proprietary OSes for it. We'll probably never see a cheap
<BR>
Alpha come out of Compaq because unlike Sun (who have one in-house hardware
<BR>
platform, SPARC and SPARC64) Compaq has x86 boxes at the low end.  They
<BR>
don't want to compete with their own Intel based products, leaving them no
<BR>
room to build low tier Alpha machines. API is the only available option and
<BR>
unlike Compaq, API builds systems, motherboards and provides a whole host of
<BR>
services, they don't just sell &quot;solutions,&quot; leaving room for the ISV/VAR.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;The important thing is to use memory that is pretty standard and cheap.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;With ALPHA's RISC design memory is probably more important than clock
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;speed for many applications.  The ability to expand memory cheaply 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gives these MB's a chance to live a LONG life.  This is attractive for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;educational buyers who generally have a longer product replacement cycle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than many corporations (5-7 years opposed to  3-5)
</EM><BR>
<P>2GB of system memory probably isn't enough headroom for 5-7 years, but
<BR>
memory technology turns over faster than chip generations (about every 9
<BR>
months), so determining how much memory should be supported is tricky. 4GB
<BR>
seems and ideal, but there is a tradeoff; supporting 2GB and larger memory
<BR>
arrays almost always involves the use of registered/buffered DIMMS as
<BR>
electrical load for large memory arrays goes well above the practical limits
<BR>
imposed by unbuffered parts (1-2GB, I believe). I don't think either AMD's
<BR>
761 or the VIA KT133A support registered memory types, though AMD's 761 does
<BR>
support ECC (KT133A does not). To support 4GB now would mean having to use
<BR>
more expensive &quot;server&quot; targeted memory, which may be rarer and even more
<BR>
expensive than it is now in 36 months as stock dwindles. This brings us back
<BR>
to a 2GB practical limit, assuming a useful working life of 48-56 months.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'd substitute &quot;Any GOOD 3d AGP chipset that has at least 24mb of on board
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;video ram and is currently supported by true64 and Linux&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Probably a good point. GeForce may be a good choice, but not to the
<BR>
exclusion of all others.  As far as I know, neither the ATI Radeon nor the
<BR>
GeForce have bootable support thanks to their 32 bit extended VGA BIOS
<BR>
routines and lack of support in most OSes that Alpha supports. For a
<BR>
platform that used to be sold on the virtue of its graphics capabilities,
<BR>
things have been in a pretty sorry state on the 3D graphics front for
<BR>
awhile.  Lack of AGP support in most Alpha platforms is only the most
<BR>
obvious issue, with Compaq controlling SRM with a stranglehold, there is no
<BR>
way to add 32 bit BIOS routines to support newer video controllers.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Again substitute &quot;Any on board 10/100 ethernet but it MUST be supported by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;True 64 and Linux&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Intel 82559 is now the &quot;hier-apparent&quot; to the 2114x Tulip, after all, Intel
<BR>
owns BOTH.  21x4x Ethernet controllers, the 21x5x PCI to PCI bridge chips,
<BR>
StrongARM and a few others all were snapped up during the Digital/Intel
<BR>
sale/cross licensing. Intel 82559 is now supported In Tru64 and OpenVMS (as
<BR>
of 7.2, I believe, 7.3 has been out for months). 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;To this I would add a single 32 bit PCI slot also (maybe 2) Just so there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is SOME room for expansion in the future.  ATA 100 support is important,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and a ATA chipset whose BIOS can be upgraded later (ATA 133?) on might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;also be useful (we are all dreaming here, so cut me some slack on this one
</EM><BR>
:)
<BR>
<P>To make it cheap, you'll probably want to build as many components in as
<BR>
possible.  Firewire will become more important than ATA (except maybe for
<BR>
serial ATA, but that's based on a similar bus protocol to IEEE 1394, but
<BR>
lacks industry wide support). Using two 64 bit PCI slots allows you to use
<BR>
32 bit or 64 bit PCI controllers. Having 66 MHz supports means being able to
<BR>
support newer 66 MHz 3.3 volt peripherals.  To do this right, the PCI slot
<BR>
capable of this should be on a separate bus from the internal bus.  I'd say
<BR>
a practical number of slots for a low price point is 2 slots, 2 PCI buses (2
<BR>
slots on one, internal PCI bus on the other). A system chipset that could
<BR>
support PCIx (133 MHz 64 bit PCI, each slot is its own bus, de-multiplexed
<BR>
address and data, streaming modes, etc) could operate in legacy PCI 2.2/2.1
<BR>
mode and support frequencies down to 25MHz, 32bit modes of operation and
<BR>
regulate voltage for legacy devices from 5.0 volts to 2.9 volts (PCIx). 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Couldn't we use LINUX in flash the way API is now?  This may/would save
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;development time, and I'm quite sure you could teach linux to load Tru 64
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unix.  Since this is aimed at the lower end keeping the development costs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;down is important.  Also the ability to be able to correctly identify
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;future hardware that is plugged into the thing should be easier. (Grab the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;source recompile linux firmware xxx and load it up) The ability to use a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more &quot;open sourced&quot; firmware loader has been discussed here before.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;think it may have a good fit in the praticulair application.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Absolutely, the only other alternative is to do an OpenBoot-like console
<BR>
based on the free implementations, like FICL.  Since Linux is the primary
<BR>
business driver of Alpha at the low end to mid-tier, it makes sense to have
<BR>
a Linux-centric system design (especially on a Linux list).  The adapted
<BR>
LinuxROM project that API is using is good evidence it is a working solution
<BR>
with none of the licensing ubiquities of SRM, AlphaBIOS or OpenBoot.  For
<BR>
Linux use, its also cleaner as there is no need for maintaining intermediate
<BR>
console firmware.  This also opens up what consistitutes supported hardware
<BR>
as that would now include just about anything their was a Linux native
<BR>
driver for.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Also DEC was pretty darn smart with the fail safe boot loader available on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;many Alpha motherboards.  I would say with the market that this is aimed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at (hobbiest and people that like to poke around) any motherboard produced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should have this option.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed, this is one of the better reasons to own an Alpha, even an old one.
<BR>
You can easily rebuild a system that has been all but physically trashed.
<BR>
Fail Safe Booter (FSB) and debug firmware (POST, environment checker, etc)
<BR>
are excellent features and its my understanding that IA64 platforms will
<BR>
offer something similar, probably as a convenience to early ISV/IHV
<BR>
developers. FSB is not present on all Alpha systems though, even some of the
<BR>
newer boards.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for commenting Aaron.
