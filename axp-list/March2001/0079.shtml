<P>
<EM>&gt; I think part of the problem is that people are expecting the latest cards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be supported in older platforms.....2940s are supported on LX,SX and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; EV6 machines, but will Compaq do another build of SRM for PWS, what about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AS200s? Multia? 
</EM><BR>
<P>That's a good point.  I have several multias (166 &amp; 233's) that still run
<BR>
RH 5.2 and use ARC and MILO.  They do what they are supposed to, and thus
<BR>
I generally don't mess with them.  They are old enough that I figured long
<BR>
ago there wouldn't be any more devlepment on them.  When they die I will
<BR>
replace them with something else. 
<BR>
<P>OTH have a PC164 (mind you that isn't that new I know), which has been a
<BR>
bear, running under 6.2 and MILO was great with the adapters I had. 
<BR>
Upgrading to SRM was a nightmare. It just seems that if the abandoned
<BR>
firmware was able to run an adpater correctly, why can't the &quot;still being
<BR>
used&quot; firmware do the same thing ? 
<BR>
<P>List of adapters that I'm sure we'd like to see run would include the
<BR>
adaptec 2940, not because of performance, but because there are so many
<BR>
examples of those cards around.  I'd also like to see SRM support almost
<BR>
ANY pci video card.  Not to trying to troll here, but I shoved a brand new
<BR>
voodoo into my 7 year old pentium 75, and voila I had video. So far about
<BR>
1 in 2 video cards have worked for me in the PC-164(suprise, el-cheapo
<BR>
cards work, high end cards usually fail :( ) EVERY card works in this OLD
<BR>
AT&amp;T P75 that hasn't EVER had a bios update since I bought it 7 years ago. 
<BR>
Can the code to strobe the PCI bus and recgonise a video adapter be that
<BR>
difficult?  Even with PAL? 
<BR>
<P>I think we can make a business case to Compaq as follows
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+Every increase in the &quot;ease of use&quot; provides another selling
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;point for your sales force.  The ability for any platform to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adapt to commonly found hardware is a bonus.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+The ability to add almost any commonly used PC hardware to a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;system greatly increases the likely hood that the system will get
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used later in it's life.  This increases the installed user base.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+Since alpha are more expensive to start with the ability for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;systems to have a longer &quot;usefull life&quot; becomes the lynch pin
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from a cost anaylsis point of view.  This means that systems
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would need firware that is updated regularly so that these systems
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can use newer components.
<BR>
<P>Just rambling, but perhaps Compaq could keep this in mind for future
<BR>
renditions of SRM.  IMHO Compaq will find more alpha adopters if it's
<BR>
easier to install and run AXP-Linux.
