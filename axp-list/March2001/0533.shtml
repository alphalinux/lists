<P>
Alvin,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I think there are a couple of problems that we are looking at here.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, not least of which is a lack of low cost entry points into the Alpha
<BR>
platform, regardless of intended purpose. From a traditional workstation
<BR>
perspective, the UP2000+ with 1 or 2 667MHz CPUs creates a misleading
<BR>
picture (though I have heard it used as a comparison) as you will still have
<BR>
to build a complete system around it.  There are many vendors on this list
<BR>
that may be able to produce a UP2000+ based system with fairly excellent
<BR>
&quot;duration of life&quot; support for the box, but $9,000-$12,000 does not qualify
<BR>
as an entry point/low cost system. Compared to other RISC platforms that are
<BR>
starting to offer a more reasonable interpretation of just what &quot;low cost&quot;
<BR>
means, we are at a loss where it comes to newer (EV6x) hardware. Even old
<BR>
XP1000 with the 500MHz 21264 (EV6 .35) are quite costly.  As such, the only
<BR>
option for an EV6x machine is a good deal on an auction site or the rare
<BR>
system coming off of lease.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Only Compaq and API are making Alpha mother boards. There are other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;manufactures of special products like Force for special applications but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;these are low volume and high price.(I could be wrong here but I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;looked and had little luck so I am sure that this is the case)
</EM><BR>
<P>Compaq sold off the OEM division to SMART who then sold it off to Force
<BR>
Computers (an industrial computer vendor).  Unless you are interested in
<BR>
backplane based industrial computer with one or two PICMG Single Board
<BR>
Computer (SBC) CPU boards, they are not in the business of making Alpha
<BR>
&quot;motherboards&quot; though they have the templates and licenses for both. Force
<BR>
offers two single board computers based on Digital's original DMCC (DEC
<BR>
Modular Computer Components) architecture. The EV56 and EV6 designs are both
<BR>
of the 1998 vintage, topping out at 600/2MB and 500 MHz/2MB respectively.
<BR>
You'll have to get the SRM console updates (5.6 is the latest) from
<BR>
Digital's old FTP site, these ship with AlphaBIOS only.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It would be nice to be able to buy an alpha workstation directly off the
</EM><BR>
Compaq web site.
<BR>
<P>You can buy some Alpha gear through Compaq's refurb site (Compaqworks), but
<BR>
that's it, and they don't keep anything in stock.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The UP1100 is now end of life and although the 1500 is in the works there
</EM><BR>
is
<BR>
<EM>&gt;no assurances from API that they will be selling the 1500 or any single
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;processor board in the near future.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, you're right about that.  UP1500 may never see the light of day,
<BR>
particularly if Samsung (not an API product) sees how dismal the sales
<BR>
figures for the UP1100 were (or so I've been told).  I'm not sure Samsung
<BR>
wants to take up the mantle to &quot;create&quot; the low cost workstation market. I
<BR>
don't think they would know how to market it properly if they made one.  If
<BR>
a large number of them don't end up in universities, colleges and perhaps
<BR>
even high schools, whatever is sold at profit will constitute very little
<BR>
and the market will not grow.  As I've said before, SPARC and RS/6000 labs
<BR>
are ubiquitous in colleges, not so for the Alpha, or any operating system it
<BR>
supports.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;At one time API announced that a deal that would the AMD processor using
</EM><BR>
the same motherboard interface as the Alpha. I had &gt;hoped that this would
<BR>
mean that there would be a reason for companies to build motherboards that
<BR>
would support both the K7 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;and the Alpha. To date I think only API has a mother board that will do
</EM><BR>
this(UP2000). The CPU's alone for this
<BR>
<EM>&gt;board run over $2000 each.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm familiar with the press releases (dating back to 1998) you are referring
<BR>
to.  Some tech magazines wrote about this with excitement as the EV6 bus was
<BR>
given center stage with the impressive performance of the new AMD Athlon
<BR>
processors.  What was not known at that time was that while electrically
<BR>
very similar, AMD chose to use the slot-1-like Slot A while API needed slot
<BR>
B.  Slot B has many more pins to support such things as power and ground and
<BR>
can operate at a higher frequency.  No &quot;Slot B&quot; Athlons were ever produced
<BR>
and similarly no &quot;Slot A&quot; Alpha processors were ever produced. As a result,
<BR>
the hopes for mass produced Alpha compatible motherboards disappeared.  I'm
<BR>
not sure that with the differences in requirements at a boot level if it
<BR>
would have ever been practical to believe that each cheap PC-like
<BR>
motherboards made on a sub 5% margin would get an SROM and SRM firmware
<BR>
console (Compaq controlled code), the Fail Safe Booter or the firmware
<BR>
debugger.  It would probably have been an incomplete &quot;customer supported&quot;
<BR>
SRM console install with questionable Q&amp;C put behind it.  With the fairly
<BR>
major differences between PC motherboards manufactured by one company vs.
<BR>
another and the 3+ chipsets that were being used in Slot A motherboards, it
<BR>
would have been a very difficult process at best.  Remember also that what
<BR>
was driving the market at the time was the left-overs from Digital's push
<BR>
for Alpha/NT acceptance in 1997, NOT Linux. When AlphaBIOS fell out of use
<BR>
with the death of Alpha/NT (also Compaq controlled code based on a MS
<BR>
controlled ARC 1.2 spec), only the SRM console was left, but the licensing
<BR>
fees, development environments (OpenVMS as opposed to AlphaBIOS's VS 6 on
<BR>
WinNT), required OS support (including Tru64 and OVMS) and the lack of
<BR>
familiarity PC vendors have with these environments would have effectively
<BR>
stopped any ongoing efforts.    
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The problem as I see it is not that there are no inexpensive systems based
</EM><BR>
on the Alpha but no inexpensive motherboards 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;based on the Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<P>Its worse than that, there are no initiatives to have one, strategically or
<BR>
otherwise.  If API were to produce one and only one board, discontinue it
<BR>
after a year and halt all support for it one year later, it would do neither
<BR>
the VARs, resellers or end users any good.  To make them cheaply, they must
<BR>
be produced in volume and that means a long term strategy must be in place.
<BR>
Compaq won't be building Alpha motherboards any time soon. API is all there
<BR>
is, and their efforts have been received with luke-warm support, in part
<BR>
because they were produced in such small quantities that they never really
<BR>
achieved a low price point. Ironically, if the Samsung UP1500 were released,
<BR>
it would probably reduce sales of the API UP2000+ as it would be around half
<BR>
the cost, probably the chief reason it will never see the light of day. Why
<BR>
Samsung is building Alpha motherboards in the first place is beyond me,
<BR>
that's what they formed API for.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for your input Alvin.  Increasingly, its becoming clear to me that
<BR>
the issue of an inexpensive, mass produced, mass marketed Alpha is a
<BR>
political red herring.  Compaq dumped Alpha projects left and right because
<BR>
Digital had tossed billions into it with only limited success. A few dozen
<BR>
well placed Alphaserver installations in key universities and loaners to
<BR>
major companies might have turned this around.  I'd love to know if that was
<BR>
ever even attempted.
<BR>
