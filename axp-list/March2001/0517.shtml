I'd thought I'd share some comments, mostly in regards to the first system
<BR>
you set out as I think this is the most viable option.

<P><EM>&gt; Enthusiast/Developer/Student (emphasis on Linux): 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Small footprint ATX deskside chassis
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; space for one internal 3.5&quot; 80GB 7200 RPM ATA-100 drive, 1 combo MKE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DVD-RAM/DVD-ROM/CD-ROM.  Optional support could be 	provided for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; standard floppy or an MKE 	LS-120 ATA-33 &quot;floptical&quot; drive in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vertical position adjacent to the CD/DVD 	drive. 300 watt ATX power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supply ATX compliant motherboard
</EM><BR>
<P>I think it would be important to make the Board 100% standard ATX
<BR>
complient so that any ATX case can be used. Make the board available to
<BR>
system resellers!  This will allow whoever produces the board to have a
<BR>
higher production run because the same board would be used in internally
<BR>
produced machines as well as sold to vendors. 
<BR>
<P>Perhaps a smaller power supply requirement?  250w?  I'd like to see future
<BR>
boards not quite so power thirsty.  Just a thought :)  VMS compat. isn't
<BR>
as critical in this product IMHO.  If some savings can be had while by
<BR>
sacrificing VMS support that may be ok.  I'd say the next step up in price
<BR>
VMS becomes more important.......just a thought.  Although if VMS support
<BR>
can be kept then &quot;hurray!&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 	700 MHz EV68 or EV69 CPU/4MB DDR HSTL cache in either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; non-upgradeable &quot;soldered on&quot; or upgradeable socketted configuration 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	AMD IG-4 761 chipset (VIA chipset may become a viable option also)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	256MB 184 pin PC266 DDR SDRAM, 4 sockets (2GB max using 512MB
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unbuffered ECC modules)
</EM><BR>
<P>The important thing is to use memory that is pretty standard and cheap.
<BR>
With ALPHA's RISC design memory is probably more important than clock
<BR>
speed for many applications.  The ability to expand memory cheaply 
<BR>
gives these MB's a chance to live a LONG life.  This is attractive for
<BR>
educational buyers who generally have a longer product replacement cycle
<BR>
than many corporations (5-7 years opposed to  3-5)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Nvidia GeForce 3 MPU, AGP 4x (integrated as a soldered on AGP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; device, no AGP slot is provided) with 32MB DDR
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd substitute &quot;Any GOOD 3d AGP chipset that has at least 24mb of on board
<BR>
video ram and is currently supported by true64 and Linux&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	Single port Intel 82559 Fast Ethernet
</EM><BR>
<P>Again substitute &quot;Any on board 10/100 ethernet but it MUST be supported by
<BR>
True 64 and Linux&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	ALi Southbridge I/O chip
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	ATA-100 support (via ALi southbridge, treated as a SCSI controller
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by the SRM console)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	Integrated USB, IrDA wireless, parallel, dual 9 pin serial, PS/2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keyboard and mouse ports (via ALi southbridge)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	Integrated PC97 accelerated audio (also via ALi southbridge) for 16
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bit, 48KHz stereo audio
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	Integrated dual port TI IEEE 1394c &quot;Firewire&quot; for external devices
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   	1 64 bit PCI slot supporting 66MHz 3.3 volt operation, isolated from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; internal PCI bus (where the Firewire, ATA-100 and 	Fast Ethernet stem).
</EM><BR>
<P>To this I would add a single 32 bit PCI slot also (maybe 2) Just so there
<BR>
is SOME room for expansion in the future.  ATA 100 support is important,
<BR>
and a ATA chipset whose BIOS can be upgraded later (ATA 133?) on might
<BR>
also be useful (we are all dreaming here, so cut me some slack on this one :)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; There are of course several technical issues to overcome: Firmware console,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SROM and operating system/SRM drivers would have to be written more or less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from scratch, to name just a few items. The system described here does bear
</EM><BR>
<P>Couldn't we use LINUX in flash the way API is now?  This may/would save
<BR>
development time, and I'm quite sure you could teach linux to load Tru 64
<BR>
unix.  Since this is aimed at the lower end keeping the development costs
<BR>
down is important.  Also the ability to be able to correctly identify
<BR>
future hardware that is plugged into the thing should be easier. (Grab the
<BR>
source recompile linux firmware xxx and load it up) The ability to use a
<BR>
more &quot;open sourced&quot; firmware loader has been discussed here before.  I
<BR>
think it may have a good fit in the praticulair application.  
<BR>
<P>Also DEC was pretty darn smart with the fail safe boot loader available on
<BR>
many Alpha motherboards.  I would say with the market that this is aimed
<BR>
at (hobbiest and people that like to poke around) any motherboard produced
<BR>
should have this option.  MANY an intel based board has had to be sent
<BR>
back because a flash bios upgrade failed.  So far EVERY alpha I own (6 of
<BR>
them) has been able to recover from a failed BIOS updates.
