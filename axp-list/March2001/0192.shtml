<P>
<EM>&gt; Type &quot;AlphaBIOS&quot; or &quot;ARC&quot; and the system will look for the ROM image on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; floppy.  If you have AlphaBIOS 5.7 on floppy (as any good Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; administrator who supports NT would) you can boot AlphaBIOS without having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it in ROM.  Its slow as molasses but it does work and is a little known
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cheat on half-flash Alphas.  Most of the PWS line, except for the &quot;A&quot; models
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had 2MB flash EEPROM and could hold SRM and AlphaBIOS concurrently, all you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had to do was to switch console to run the OS of your choice.
</EM><BR>
<P>My 500a has both SRM and AlphaBIOS resident.
