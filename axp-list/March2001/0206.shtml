<P>Well, linuxthreads is a little naive but I see that as a good thing,
<BR>
since it is less likely to have bugs than a complex m x n
<BR>
implementation.
<BR>
<P>glibc 2.2 will fix some outstanding issues as well.

<P><EM>&gt; I found a number of places where MySQL would break that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seem to be realated to thread creation and mmap. But I have been assuerd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by the linuxthreads maintainers that I am stupid and this could not be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the case ;)

<P>Was that with SMP, by any chance?  Alpha is probably the most
<BR>
challenging platform for threaded apps.  If a package works correctly on
<BR>
Alpha, it is likely to be correct everywhere else.  That's yet another
<BR>
good excuse to develop and test on Alpha hardware ;)
<BR>
<P>Besides that, there are many corner cases in pthreads that are
<BR>
underspecified (the &quot;p&quot; in pthreads surely doesn't stand for
<BR>
&quot;portable&quot;).
