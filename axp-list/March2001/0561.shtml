<P>
Thanks for all the help on my password problem.  Setting the os flags to
<BR>
single worked to get me to an aboot prompt.  I still have not made the disks
<BR>
I need to boot from aboot and change the root password but am confident that
<BR>
after doing so this problem will have been resolved.  I'm sure I will have
<BR>
more questions around optimization of this server for database processing
<BR>
after I have a chance to poke around in it and see what my options are.

<P><EM>&gt; Rich I have a digital 7300 that I picked up at a liquidation. It has

redhat
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 6.2 installed and the password the folks gave me is invalid.  I don't see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any means of getting a prompt that offers an option like single where I
</EM><BR>
can
<BR>
<EM>&gt; reset the passwd.  I have been attempting to do boot from the srm console
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but when I do that it comes back to console secure - parameters not
</EM><BR>
allowed.
<BR>
<P>AH...so you don't know the SRM password?  Yes I am into the console and
<BR>
after I login to it I can execute commands but...
<BR>
When I do boot dka500(the cdrom) it attempts a boot but I end up back in the
<BR>
console with a &quot; console secure - parameters not allowed&quot;
<BR>
I will read more about the boot flags and anxiously await any additional
<BR>
help on Monday.  Thanks...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;That's a different
<BR>
story....there's a way to clear it. I'll have to look it up on Monday
<BR>
(something to do with the HALT button if I remember correctly, anyone??).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have also tried setting the bootdef_dev to the cdrom but I get a double
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exception when I go this route.  Is there a way to boot from the cdrom and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get past the system console so I can rescue the passwd?
</EM><BR>
<P>If you can change the bootdef_dev variable then the console isn't locked.
<BR>
You should then be able to add 'single' to the boot_osflage, and erase the
<BR>
root password from the /etc/passwd file
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I am totally green on Linux and alpha systems.  Any help is appreciated.
