Greetings all,
<BR>
<P>There are a significant number of choices for backup devices, most of which
<BR>
remain magnetic tape of one kind or another, but also optical storage
<BR>
(Phasechange, Magneto Optical and more recently CD-RW/DVD-RW and DVD-RAM,
<BR>
all based on phasechange). The cost of the drives and the inherent tradeoffs
<BR>
in any of these solutions should be considered. Their primary use will
<BR>
determine the best solution, though its pretty clear that none of the backup
<BR>
tape or optical solutions will be sufficient at a low price point to backup
<BR>
very high capacity magnetic disk drives and this trend seems only to be
<BR>
increasing. 
<BR>
<P>You are also better off tarring up and gunzipping the whole volume you want
<BR>
to backup before running your backup utility as the 2:1 compression of the
<BR>
tape drives compression engine is no-where-near as fast as a drive with
<BR>
compression turned off and manually zipping up your archive to upwards of
<BR>
50:1 compression ratio.
<BR>
<P>For home use at a low cost, the Travan drives (essentially QIC reborn), DSS
<BR>
4mm drives and the newer low cost drives like the Onstream (deceased) are
<BR>
the sweet spot for cost/drive capacity but with the exception of DDS-4 and
<BR>
possible Onstream, these are relatively slow and use much more fragile media
<BR>
with a much shorter useable lifespan.  If an occasional full or incremental
<BR>
backup is needed, a Travan or DDS-3 tape drive should be fine, provided you
<BR>
can exclude anything not necessary for recovery or which can be easily
<BR>
re-installed from disk (i.e, don't backup a support directory full of app
<BR>
bins or utils). 20-24GB compressed rates are the standard fair.
<BR>
<P>I have yet to see anyone with those new 80+GB drives in their new desktop
<BR>
home computers have a suitable backup solution in place or even a plan to
<BR>
backup said drive assuming they actually filled it.  Backing up more than
<BR>
about 30GB today requires much more expensive drives that are priced well
<BR>
outside of the same commodity markets that sell 80-90GB disk drives or
<BR>
bundle them in low-cost home computers. Running the backup set across many
<BR>
tapes is a possible solution, but requires an amount of operator
<BR>
hand-holding to swap tapes.  Backup times and restore times on such low-end
<BR>
drives is also pretty staggering.  One wonders if they could not make a
<BR>
business case that a 120GB disk drive should NOT be made available before a
<BR>
suitable optical or tape backup device is introduced at an appropriate price
<BR>
to actually USE that capacity safely.  On systems where you can stripe data
<BR>
in a RAID of one level or another, chances are you also have a tape library
<BR>
or an autoloader to take the work out of backing up the full capacity of the
<BR>
array.  The cheapest tape autoloaders that can be had are either used DLT or
<BR>
DDS-4.  I've seen a few at www.teamexcess.com (HP drives) with a 5 tape
<BR>
magazine and DDS-4 capacities (40GB per tape, compressed) at $250.00.  These
<BR>
are a rarity.
<BR>
<P>Until blue laser becomes practical, optical drive technology is way behind
<BR>
the curve compared with magnetic storage.  DVD-RAM could easily scale to
<BR>
50GB per layer, 100GB per side (dual layer, dual sided), but the DVD-RAM
<BR>
drives are still single headed and can't read the capacity on the other side
<BR>
of the media without flipping (identical to the MO and old phasechange).
<BR>
Optical is still a better choice than tape for random access, but data files
<BR>
generally aren't that dependent and the idea of HSM (Hierarchal Storage
<BR>
Management) to migrate files from &quot;online&quot; storage to &quot;half-line&quot; optical
<BR>
storage (usually an optical library) and then to &quot;offline&quot; tape is almost
<BR>
dead with single drives approaching 180GB on a half-height 3.5&quot; drive. For
<BR>
fast access to multimedia files and long storage life, its hard to beat
<BR>
5.2GB DVD-RAM, particularly at a fraction of the cost to the somewhat faster
<BR>
MO 5.3 drives. Also, these disks have a total immunity to EMI, good if
<BR>
you're planning on taking one into space or surviving a nuclear attack. :)
<BR>
<P>The price delta between an LTO or DST tape drive and a single Seagate 15K
<BR>
180GB disk is enormous. I'd petition my congressman, if I thought it would
<BR>
help.:)
