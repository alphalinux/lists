<P><EM>&gt; Unfortunately, this is one of the main things that drives people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; away from setting up Alphas.  As much as SRM seems to offer, it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interface is not very intuitive.  It's aimed at the power user
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *nix geek.  (It's a problem that Linux in general has too.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, as people get attracted to the OS and the hardware it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; becomes more of an issue from a learning perspective.  ARC was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a bit better, AlphaBIOS tried to make it homely (maybe too homely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [although the opening Alpha logo was cool]).  IMHO, I think the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; basic menu of a Award or Phoenix based PC BIOS is good.  You get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in, hit the menu items you need to, set the boot order (floppy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hard drive or CDROM), get out and reboot. :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed. Though like you said, these machines run UNIX not windows.
<BR>
It's not an excuse to cop out of having a nice BIOS setup your hardware
<BR>
and bootstrap your box. I don't fully understand why milo was needed to begin
<BR>
with. If it was all just to switch palcode and mess with some registers then
<BR>
why couldnt ARC/AB be extend to use that PAL and do the setup required and your
<BR>
off. The only thing you would care about is passing cli arguments and you
<BR>
already
<BR>
could do that with ARC/AB. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; My biggest beef with SRM is   DOCUMENTATION.   As far as I can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; find there is none, at least not up to date.  There's an ancient
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one in the Compaq/Digital documentation archive.  But I've never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seen a current one.  Not even on the firmware update CD.  And
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; help &lt;command&gt; is too vague for some of the commands.  (If it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matters I have a LX164 with SRM 5.8-1.)
</EM><BR>
<P>I love the help on &quot;ed&quot;. Try it , you'll get a laugh. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe you can load the firmware off of CDROM too.  If I recall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right, I think this is how the firmware update CD works.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure of the exact mechenism that starts the firmware update CD.
<BR>
It uses fwupdate, I dont know how that works.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; EXT2 support in SRM is nice but whats stopping SRM from loading linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; off a FAT fs of which it already understands?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I thought SRM did not understand filesystems.  I thought it knew
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough about a device to pull physical blocks of media into memory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and execute the code from there... that's why aboot was written to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; read the ext2 partition and load the kernel.(?)
</EM><BR>
<P>SRM understands FS like FAT and ISO9660 but not the concept of 
<BR>
parititons. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; What would really help for those that may still run NT or perfer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slightly more sane partition table format is if SRM could be told to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; look for the boot block somewhere other than what is the DOS/PC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; style partition table sector.
</EM><BR>
<P>I thought there where patches for aboot out there that let it understand
<BR>
PC partition style?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The other problem with BOOTP is the person just getting started with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux and/or Alpha.  Setting up another server just to boot a Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will scare even more people away for time and money reasons.
</EM><BR>
<P>yup. Though for &quot;us&quot; we can set that sort of thing up and have or boxen
<BR>
with root hardware raid on a controller not support by SRM etc. 
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Well, how about _removing_ some of the more esoteric features of SRM to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stand-alone executables.  I'm talking about things like memexer, isacfg,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; etc. that are nice but take up space and you don't need them to boot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the machine all the time.  ARC/AlphaBIOS was good for this as it had a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SDK that you can program with your own add-ons  (ARCDOS being one example).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The executables could be loaded from disk or floppy.  If those features
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could be moved out of SRM and still being accessable (say on a bootable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CD) for those that need it, then you could put more enhancments into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the base SRM.
</EM><BR>
<P>Here I disagree since those tools can aid the OEM, VAR, or Manufacturer
<BR>
to troubleshoot and stress test the hardware. It would also be cost prohibitive
<BR>
from a manufacturing POV to assmeble a product with the &quot;full featured&quot; firmware
<BR>
and later reflash it to the econosize. The software could possibly diverge from
<BR>
it's trunk so much that it becomes it's own thing and has it's own bugs ontop
<BR>
of those of the &quot;original&quot; firmware. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I disagree.  Video support is number 2 after storage controllers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How many times do we watch and see the new PCI/AGP card-of-the-month
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; come out and go ooooh that would just make my Alpha fly, only to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one and be greeted with a blank screen (if you're lucky it boots at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all).  I mean I'd love to slap a Geforce2 MX into a PC64, but it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't work.  On the flip side when the Multia's got blown out and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everyone seemed to be buying one, there were all sorts of inquiries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the lists about which card can use etc.  Some people were able
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to find the S3 cards.  I don't know what the people that could not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; find one did, hopefully not junk the board.
</EM><BR>
<P>I though I did make it point number 2? I intended to anyways :-)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I know you can't please everyone all the time.  And I know it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does boil down to money at some point.  It's too bad that at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for video that the emulator couldn't be seperated from the console
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in some way so people with old machines could at least update the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; emulator.
</EM><BR>
<P>It probably could be made a seperate image though now you run into
<BR>
problems with starting the initial firmware. On most Alphas the SROM
<BR>
that executes at poweron is told to load the second rom image and execute.
<BR>
<P>Now if rom image number 2 was the bios emulator number 3 would be SRM.
<BR>
There are two points of attack here now. Modify the SROM, which is a read
<BR>
only chip to load image 2 then load and start image 3. Or fix independant
<BR>
bios emulator rom so that when it's down initialize that it should locate
<BR>
the next adjacent rom image (depending on jumper configuartion) and load 
<BR>
it. 
<BR>
<P>You could make your own SROM using the EBSDK, thats one. It has source
<BR>
code for sx,lx, and dp. I'm talking about version 4.0 . To accomplish
<BR>
option number two you would need the source to the bios emulator, which I
<BR>
suspect won't be readily offered by Compqa so you're forced to seek alternatives
<BR>
like the one used by the xfree group.
<BR>
<P><P>I have accomplished the later but in a roundabout way. In my first attempts
<BR>
to use DBM for the LX I tried to load it from the FSB and wondered why I heard
<BR>
a few beeps but then nothing on my display (VGA). I then got clever and
<BR>
renamed the file lx164nt.rom, put it on a floppy, and in srm entered &quot;NT&quot;. 
<BR>
which read the DBM ,loaded it, and executed it right over the SRM console.
<BR>
Since the DBM image didnt have a bios emulator attached and the setup
<BR>
routines that go with it. It didnt reset the console, it just loaded :-)
<BR>

<BR>
Speaking of the EBSDK. If one had it could one put it on an ftp
<BR>
site and redistribute it? The license is a BSD'sh for Alpha only.
