<P>
I realize there is a great deal of discussion that goes on within the
<BR>
group, specific to pricing of x86, Alpha and others. I've certainly been
<BR>
wrong before, but I really dislike seeing input such as this. 
<BR>
<P>There are many of us that could broadcast our latest and greatest sales
<BR>
promotions, but I don't believe that was the intent or this user group. I
<BR>
should think it far more appropriate to offer this information directly to
<BR>
those who have pricing questions. 
<BR>
<P>Word gets out quickly when one company or another has a value proposition
<BR>
to offer.
<BR>
<P>cheers

<EM>&gt;&gt; Greg,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;API already has the UP1100, which uses AMD's chipset. I haven't asked,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;but one would presume that they will continue to have a low-end
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;machine using the least expensive motherboard possible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; I have been informed that UP1100 is EOL.  As is the older SlotB based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; UP1000.  At this point, only the Samsung product (not an API product) with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; name dangerously similar to those built and sold by APIis slated to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; AMD Iron Gate G4 (761), dubiously named the UP1500. Samsung has some info
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; their site about it, though it is still under &quot;development.&quot; At first I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; thought that the UP1500 would be a fairly innovative offering to provide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Alpha platform community with an &quot;enthusiast&quot;/ entry level programmer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; workstation or web appliance.  On closer inspection however, it looks like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; it has retained the rather unusual UP1100 non-standard ATX arrangement, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; detail pointed out to me by a colleague.  This isn't much of a problem in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; desk side workstation I should think, but would probably pose a problem in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; sourcing rack mount chassis that would fit without obscuring slots, drives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; or memory banks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Sun has managed to produce some excellent low-cost systems that are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;selling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; like hotcakes.  The added benefit is that exposure and access ultimately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; leads to increased acceptance and a larger user base, along with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;obvious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; benefit of more software (and often better software). The Sun Blade 100,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Netra X1 AC200 and the new line of SPARCEngine motherboards including the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; AXi and the AXe are making it easier and cheaper to buy, build or OEM an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Ultra SPARC II based system (and soon enough, Ultra III). I bought an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; SPARCEngine AXi with a 360MHz UIIi CPU and 256MB of RAM from NU Horizons
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; little more than $700.00.  An Ultra 30 coming off of lease soon followed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; It's now possible to obtain a 500 MHz IIe system like the Netra X1 or the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Sun Blade 100 for less than $1,000, but there is absolutely nothing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;similar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; in the Alpha arsenal.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Having broached the question more than once for a quote from most of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; vendors still selling Alpha solutions, obtaining a 4.5 year old 164LX
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; motherboard with a 533 or 600MHz EV56 CPU is usually about a $900 to $1200
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; proposition, and that's before integrating an actual system together.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Having gone this route in the past, I'm inclined to suggest to obtaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; systems that are already fully integrated and guaranteed fully functional.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; I obtained my last Alpha through Ebay auctions and scored a PWS 600au with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 512MB memory and an 18GB drive for under $1,000 (not the going rate, even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; year later).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; At current, the only practical, low cost option for Alpha platform
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; enthusiasts (ranging from the stalwart OpenVMS crowd/DECUS groups, the BSD
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; camp, the living-dead of the Alpha/NT camp and the Alpha/Linux camp),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; students or programmers is for obtaining out of date hardware through the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; auction sites or calling up leasing companies that occasionally give up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Digital branded workstations and servers for a song. It could be said
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; is no Alpha workstation market anymore, but what are all those clustered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Alpha systems that are filling the computing media being programmed on?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;How
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; many people on this list would be willing to part with $1,500 or so to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; fully integrated &quot;Sun Blade&quot; style Alpha, just to keep their stake in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; platform, write some code and keep their platform specific skills up? If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; could run OpenVMS and Tru64, there would be an automatic market in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;DECUS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; crowd and plenty of shops with an OpenVMS and Tru64 investment would snap
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; them up. Linux users would love them as they would be price competitive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Athlon Thunderbirds on the X86 front. Whatever replaces the UP1x00 needs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; address these issues, its been so long since a cost-effective solution
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;worth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; buying has come out, they'd be all the rage.  There would be dozens of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ways
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; to promote such a system.  Sun is proof enough it can be done (remember
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; an old Ultra II based system like the Ultra Enterprise 450 workgroup
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; server/workstation still fetches some $20,000 for the base unit and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; $2800 per 450MHz CPU).
</EM><BR>
