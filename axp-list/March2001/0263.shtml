<P>
is there anything else on the SCSI chain with the drive (i.e. CDRom)? I
<BR>
solved my MILO problem by switching to SRM. You may want to try removing all
<BR>
other devices from the scsi controller and seeing if that helps.
<BR>
<P>My problems were also on a SymBIOS 53c895 based controller. I'm not sure
<BR>
what controller the AS200's use, but if it's SymBIOS based, it may be a
<BR>
similar problem.

Subject: ST15150N SCSI HD trouble
<BR>
<P><P>Hi,
<BR>
I recently bought a Seagate Barracuda ST15150N and am having trouble getting
<BR>
Linux onto it. My system is an AlphaStation 200 4/233. I set the drive's
<BR>
SCSI id to 0, the termination to active, and the termination power set to be
<BR>
supplied by the drive. However when  try to boot from MILO I either get a
<BR>
series of periods after &quot;Please wait while setting up devices&quot; with MILO
<BR>
2.0.35-c7b or the boot process stops after expanding the kernel and doing
<BR>
some SCSI probing with an older MILO.
<BR>
<P>Am I doing anything blatantly wrong in what I describe above? Does the
<BR>
ST15150N work with the SCSI controller on the AS 200? What would you suggest
<BR>
my doing?
<BR>
<P>I read the archives of the list and found a similar problem, but found no
<BR>
applicable answers in that thread. However, that person with a similar
<BR>
problem was trying to add a SCSI disk to an already set system, whereas I
<BR>
would like this disk to be my main (and only) disk on my system.
<BR>
<P>Thank you,
<BR>
ZP
<BR>
