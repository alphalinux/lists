</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I'd substitute &quot;Any GOOD 3d AGP chipset that has at least 24mb of on board
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;video ram and is currently supported by true64 and Linux&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Probably a good point. GeForce may be a good choice, but not to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exclusion of all others.  As far as I know, neither the ATI Radeon nor the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; GeForce have bootable support thanks to their 32 bit extended VGA BIOS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; routines and lack of support in most OSes that Alpha supports. 
</EM><BR>
<P>SRM 5.9 has an updated BIOS emulator that can handle Radeon, TNT2 (5.8 can
<BR>
can that one), don't know about GeForce.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Couldn't we use LINUX in flash the way API is now?  This may/would save
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;development time, and I'm quite sure you could teach linux to load Tru 64
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;unix.  
</EM><BR>
[snip]
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Absolutely, the only other alternative is to do an OpenBoot-like console
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; based on the free implementations, like FICL.  Since Linux is the primary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; business driver of Alpha at the low end to mid-tier, it makes sense to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a Linux-centric system design (especially on a Linux list).  The adapted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; LinuxROM project that API is using is good evidence 
</EM><BR>
<P>Ummm...not quite. API's Linux in ROM is not based on the OpenBIOS
<BR>
project. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;FSB is not present on all Alpha systems though, even some of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; newer boards.
</EM><BR>
<P>Boards that don't have FSB usually have DBM (debug Monitor) which can be
<BR>
used to repair flash images, not as easy to use as FSB though.
