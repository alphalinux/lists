<EM>&gt; While in theory I agree, remember that SRM is there to boot DU/Tru64, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; until very recently there has been no adaptec support in that OS.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As for dying a slow death...the SRM for the platform usually supports the

<EM>&gt; devices that were common at the time.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Is it just me or is there a hell of a lot that SRM doesn't &quot;recgonize&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; correctly.  I may be off base (hey what else is new) but it seems that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; SOMONE (err compaq) should be able to develop a SRM that understands most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; peoples video cards and common scsi cards (doesn't recgnise 2940?? sheesh)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Anyone know if this is a possability, or is compaq just waiting for us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;low end&quot; linux guys to die a natural death?
</EM><BR>
<P>I am not sure any of us with older equipment should expect any support
<BR>
for new deivices on older hardware. I can think of no company that will
<BR>
provide ongoing development of new capabilities in products that are no
<BR>
longer sold. In gerneral you are lucky if you can get bugs fixed let
<BR>
alone any enhcnments.
<BR>
<P>Having said that. I would like to bring up a subject that is near and
<BR>
dear to my heart. MILO.
<BR>
<P>Because the source for MILO is generaly available and it is based on the
<BR>
linux kernel, new drivers can be added reasonably easly. For the same
<BR>
reason bugs can be fixed when they crop up.
<BR>
<P>MILO has some problems with setting up some motherboards. The usual
<BR>
answer I get to questions about MILO are &quot;well just use SRM it is there
<BR>
and works&quot;.  I think this discussion is evidence that althought SRM is
<BR>
there it does not allways work.
<BR>
<P>Would it not be worth the while of the Alpha community to try and find a
<BR>
single boot loader and get it working with all the various motherboards.
<BR>
Somthing that the community as a whole can support. Right now there are
<BR>
at least 4 different loaders with various levels of support.
