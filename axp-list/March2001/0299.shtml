<EM>&gt; ST15150N with SRM/Symbios
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ST15150W with AlphaBios/MILO/Symbios
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the later being a 68 pin and now reported as rz29b under SRM.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It was on SX164 mobo, could reflash if anyone is interested.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hi,
<BR>
I ran out of tricks: I cannot get the ST15150N to work with my Alpha. I go
<BR>
as far as to bootstrap the kernel, but the process hangs when the SCSI bus
<BR>
probe reaches that drive. I tried all the suggestion made on this list
<BR>
(thank you very much) plus _all_ the permutations of jumpers imaginable. The
<BR>
only &quot;success&quot; I had was to manage to get the booting process to activate
<BR>
the disk spin...
<BR>
<P>Just for the heck of it, I attached that drive to one of my Macs and it
<BR>
worked flawlessly: I formatted it in a couple different formats (HFS+ and
<BR>
UFS), copied a few files... Therefore, it seems like the drive is good.
<BR>
<P>How could I reflash the drive's firmware to rz29b?
<BR>
<P>Moreover, which hard disk would you recommend me to buy as a replacement? I
<BR>
used to have a Seagate Medalist--which died ingloriously, but worked fine
<BR>
for more than three years. Does the 6 GB limit apply under Linux too?
<BR>
<P>Thank you, 
<BR>
ZP
