Until the Compaq purchase, Digital offered a SRM developers kit, that
<BR>
included documentation, code samples, and OEM pal code (the pal code Milo
<BR>
uses). for about $125. However when Compaq sold off the OEM group they
<BR>
stopped offering this kit.
<BR>
<P>Maybe some pressure could be brought to offer the kit again.

<EM>&gt; I agree. I &quot;like&quot; SRM. I'm confortable with it and have come to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appreciate all the neat things it can do for you. Never is there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a &quot;BIOS&quot; I have seen that gives you so much control
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and does it with as much grace as SRM console does.
</EM><BR>
<P>Unfortunately, this is one of the main things that drives people
<BR>
away from setting up Alphas.  As much as SRM seems to offer, it's
<BR>
interface is not very intuitive.  It's aimed at the power user
<BR>
*nix geek.  (It's a problem that Linux in general has too.)
<BR>
However, as people get attracted to the OS and the hardware it
<BR>
becomes more of an issue from a learning perspective.  ARC was
<BR>
a bit better, AlphaBIOS tried to make it homely (maybe too homely
<BR>
[although the opening Alpha logo was cool]).  IMHO, I think the
<BR>
basic menu of a Award or Phoenix based PC BIOS is good.  You get
<BR>
in, hit the menu items you need to, set the boot order (floppy,
<BR>
hard drive or CDROM), get out and reboot. :)
<BR>
<P>My biggest beef with SRM is   DOCUMENTATION.   As far as I can
<BR>
find there is none, at least not up to date.  There's an ancient
<BR>
one in the Compaq/Digital documentation archive.  But I've never
<BR>
seen a current one.  Not even on the firmware update CD.  And
<BR>
help &lt;command&gt; is too vague for some of the commands.  (If it
<BR>
matters I have a LX164 with SRM 5.8-1.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yes but the kicker here is you have to load that secondary bootloader
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from an SRM supported device. So unless you always want to load
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; firmware X off a floppy (which isnt the most reliable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; medium in the world) you're back to square one.
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe you can load the firmware off of CDROM too.  If I recall
<BR>
right, I think this is how the firmware update CD works.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; EXT2 support in SRM is nice but whats stopping SRM from loading linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; off a FAT fs of which it already understands?
</EM><BR>
<P>I thought SRM did not understand filesystems.  I thought it knew
<BR>
enough about a device to pull physical blocks of media into memory
<BR>
and execute the code from there... that's why aboot was written to
<BR>
read the ext2 partition and load the kernel.(?)
<BR>
<P>What would really help for those that may still run NT or perfer
<BR>
slightly more sane partition table format is if SRM could be told to
<BR>
look for the boot block somewhere other than what is the DOS/PC
<BR>
style partition table sector. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; If I could drill it into people's head to use BOOTP as their primary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boostrap method this discussion wouldnt have half the urgency it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; presents since the #1 killer here is not being able to boot off host
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; adapter X. Again, I'm assuming here that majority of  people have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; small private networks with a DHCP server. It's not like you can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get a SRM support ethernet device, Any intel nic will do. I wish 3Com
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worked as well but ho hum.
</EM><BR>
<P>The other problem with BOOTP is the person just getting started with
<BR>
Linux and/or Alpha.  Setting up another server just to boot a Alpha
<BR>
will scare even more people away for time and money reasons.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I agree that the host adapter list is way too short and wish it could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extended.  Problem is from a engineering POV. If you just added X new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; features to SRM console you now have X regression tests to set guidelines
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for and implement.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Else you document what you did, make an errata, and call the software an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unsupported BETA. Both require some amount of engineering resources but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before that there would need to be a concensus from managment to implement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one of the projects to begin with.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, how about _removing_ some of the more esoteric features of SRM to
<BR>
stand-alone executables.  I'm talking about things like memexer, isacfg,
<BR>
etc. that are nice but take up space and you don't need them to boot
<BR>
the machine all the time.  ARC/AlphaBIOS was good for this as it had a
<BR>
SDK that you can program with your own add-ons  (ARCDOS being one example).
<BR>
The executables could be loaded from disk or floppy.  If those features
<BR>
could be moved out of SRM and still being accessable (say on a bootable
<BR>
CD) for those that need it, then you could put more enhancments into
<BR>
the base SRM.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Video support would be a &quot;nice thing&quot;.  It's not a need per say but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those of us with 3 year old LX's who don't have the ching to spend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on a UP1K &quot;just&quot; to get a AGP graphics card is unreasonable. Especially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so since there hasnt been an &quot;affordable&quot; Alpha in the price/value
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market since the SX and that was... almost 3 years ago. A new bios
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; emulator would let folks able to go out and get the PCI Radeon cards,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Oxygen GVX1 cards (which X has yet to support AFAIK), and IBM's fireGL
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1 (has that been released yet?). Short list yes  but the list is too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; short as it stands already.
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree.  Video support is number 2 after storage controllers.
<BR>
How many times do we watch and see the new PCI/AGP card-of-the-month 
<BR>
come out and go ooooh that would just make my Alpha fly, only to get
<BR>
one and be greeted with a blank screen (if you're lucky it boots at
<BR>
all).  I mean I'd love to slap a Geforce2 MX into a PC64, but it
<BR>
doesn't work.  On the flip side when the Multia's got blown out and
<BR>
everyone seemed to be buying one, there were all sorts of inquiries
<BR>
to the lists about which card can use etc.  Some people were able
<BR>
to find the S3 cards.  I don't know what the people that could not
<BR>
find one did, hopefully not junk the board.
<BR>
<P>I know you can't please everyone all the time.  And I know it
<BR>
does boil down to money at some point.  It's too bad that at least
<BR>
for video that the emulator couldn't be seperated from the console
<BR>
in some way so people with old machines could at least update the
<BR>
emulator.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I have probably rambled too much.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You think you where rambling?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's a good thing sometimes :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>It's a good thing.  It goes along with venting. :)
<BR>
<P>Alan
<BR>
<P>P.S. Peter, none of the above is meant to respond to you only.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I _was_ venting...
