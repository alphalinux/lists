<P>
That seems like a *really* shallow view of what Red Hat does...
<BR>
<P>The easiset difference between RH and MS is that you can
<BR>
download a complete OS and a copy of the manual for free
<BR>
(save the cost of the internet connection), MS does not.
<BR>
<P>The difference between the version of RH that is shrinkwrapped
<BR>
contains commercial software licensed from third parties (who
<BR>
want to be paid for their efforts) and support. MS does NOT
<BR>
support their OS installation directly, they rely on the vendor
<BR>
(OEM) in nearly all cases - go to <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">http://www.microsoft.com</A> and
<BR>
look for a phone number to call for problems with WinNT
<BR>
installation...
<BR>
<P>There is very little compariosn possible between MS and RH,
<BR>
their busuness models are so radically different!
<BR>
<P>Also, it is my understanding that there will be a lower cost (yet
<BR>
still supported) release of RH Linux 6.0 coming - it will have
<BR>
email support only, no phone support.
<BR>
<P>HTH,
<BR>

<P><P><EM>&gt;I think RH is  worst than Microsoft.. At least Microsoft sell their own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;product (Windows 98).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Redhat just compile (the free Linux) and distribute the product.
