<P><EM>&gt; You are absolutely correct; the RH 6.0 generic kernel ought to be later than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 2.2.3 I pointed you to, and may even have had the sym53c8xx driver in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; configuration.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Are you sure you don't have an 895 or 896 instead of the 875? Those would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be more likely to cause problems.
</EM><BR>
<P>I just pulled the card, it's definitely an 875.  The board is integrated
<BR>
with a NIC.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Also, you could still try moving the card to one of the top slots (ie onto
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; PCI bus 0, if its not already there); the sym53c8xx driver in the current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sources (through 2.2.9, I believe) doesn't work with controllers on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; second primary PCI bus.
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, I just moved the card like you suggested.  Still the same problems
<BR>
and it's still picking the ncr53c8xx driver rather than the sym53c8xx
<BR>
driver that I want it to use.  I'm still getting timeouts after the
<BR>
scsi bus resets.  Is there any way to force the installation to use
<BR>
the sym53c8xx driver rather than the ncr53c8xx through kernel parameters?
