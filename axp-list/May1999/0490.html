<EM>&gt; does anyone know why redhat 6.0 is up in the high $70's. Do they

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; publish on their compilation CD ?
</EM><BR>
<P>Because they are a business, and a good business makes profits.
<BR>
Also, at $70 for an OS, you're at a fraction of fair market for
<BR>
anything approaching an equivalent OS solution...
<BR>
Okay, they didn't author the software, but they did integrate it.
<BR>
<P>If I had to download, compile, install, test (integrate) all of
<BR>
the packages that go into any distro, it would cost my company
<BR>
1000's of dollars of my time at each release.
<BR>
Add to that any level of tech support (so that other admins can bug
<BR>
RedHat instead of me sometimes) and you have a real bargain.
<BR>
<P>How do they spend this money?
<BR>
They're investing in corporate support, RHCE, metalab, E, Alan Cox...
<BR>
Things like RHCE and support don't mean alot to me, but they do
<BR>
to many companies. Even if I never use them, their very existence 
<BR>
adds to the commercial viability of Linux (which does mean alot to me).
<BR>
<P>RedHat offers the sugar-coating that lets corporate America swallow Linux.
