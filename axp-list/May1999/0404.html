<P>
[Apologies for the somewhat off-topic post, but this is related to my
<BR>
Alphastation which serves (among other things) as an FTP site for some
<BR>
Alpha/Linux files.]
<BR>
<P>At 4:30PM Eastern today, and lasting until 6PM, someone from
<BR>
&quot;dialup102-MARK-ITT.ru&quot; (195.161.91.81 and &quot;dialup107-MARK-ITT.ru&quot;
<BR>
(195.161.91.86) connected to orangesherbert's FTP server 694 times (about 8
<BR>
times a minute).  Since I have a limit of 5 anonymous users allowed on at any
<BR>
one time, 632 of those requests were rejected.  Of the requests that got
<BR>
through (All 5 available sessions were used at any given time), they all got
<BR>
varying amounts of one of the precompiled Mozilla binaries available at my site
<BR>
before disconnecting.  I am concerned that, had I not had limits on the number
<BR>
of connections, this person would have loaded the hell out of my box and
<BR>
connection.
<BR>
<P>Question for the experts:  Does this look like a denial-of-service attack
<BR>
attempt, or is the person above using some bastardized version of wget (or a
<BR>
similar utility) that tries to open a whole bunch of simultaneous connections
<BR>
to get one file?
<BR>
<P>(The net result of this event was merely a bunch of extra lines in the logs -
<BR>
no perceptible slowdown on the Alpha - I was browsing with Mozilla during part
<BR>
of this. :) )
<BR>
<P><PRE>
