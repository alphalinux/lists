Jay,
<BR>
<P>Okay, I just tried the 2.2.3 Red Hat 5.2 generic image that you suggested.
<BR>
That also picks the ncr53c8xx driver and that too times out after the
<BR>
scsi bus resets.
<BR>
<P>I would prefer to use the 875.  I guess I might need to run the drives
<BR>
off the motherboard.
<BR>
<P>Any suggestions?  Can a Red Hat 6.0 image file be made with the syn53c8xx
<BR>
driver?
<BR>
<P><PRE>

&gt; &gt; I'll give it a try with the kernel you mention below and let you know
&gt; &gt; what happens.  I think that the generic.img file shipped with Red Hat 6.0
&gt; &gt; alpha is using 2.2.5, which is newer than the 2.2.3 you mention below.
&gt; 
&gt; Duh! Sorry about that... :-(
&gt; 
&gt; That's what I get for staying up so late - my brain was asleep, but my
&gt; fingers were still typing... ;-}
&gt; 
&gt; You are absolutely correct; the RH 6.0 generic kernel ought to be later than
&gt; the 2.2.3 I pointed you to, and may even have had the sym53c8xx driver in the
&gt; configuration.
&gt; 
&gt; Are you sure you don't have an 895 or 896 instead of the 875? Those would
&gt; be more likely to cause problems.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, you could still try moving the card to one of the top slots (ie onto
&gt; PCI bus 0, if its not already there); the sym53c8xx driver in the current
&gt; sources (through 2.2.9, I believe) doesn't work with controllers on the
&gt; second primary PCI bus.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck, and let me know how you make out...
