<P>
Phone support is &quot;installation&quot; support only. Real support is much bigger
<BR>
bucks. Unlimited support ~$60,000 bucks!
<BR>
The half price CD doesn't mention architecture - but i can guess who's.
<BR>
<P>I myself dont count on support from any company - if the software company
<BR>
doesn't get you then the phone company will get you.
<BR>
Thanks for telling me on how to get &amp; make my own CD's. Folks on ebay are
<BR>
selling them ~$9.00. Probably not a genuine redhat cd.
<BR>
<P>But my supporting the real Redhat was getting harder to do at $40 (
<BR>
discounted at shows), At list of $80, it will be nearly impossible,
<BR>
particularily when all i see is redhat intel boxes for sale. I suppose this
<BR>
would be more to my point.

<EM>&gt; &gt; publish on their compilation CD ?

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They employ a number of developers, and all their code is GPL'd.  These
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people are paid out of their profits, naturally.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The &quot;Official Red Hat&quot; CD includes phone support; they also sell a CD
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and manual without such support for half the price.  And, you can just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; download RH 6.0 and pay nothing, or buy one of the cheap CD's various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; companies have put together (harder to do the latter for Alpha, though).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Or whatever.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Upgrades to windows (95,98,NT)  are in the $90 ( if u look real hard )
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Have you priced Windows source code recently?  Installation support?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You're comparing apples to oranges.  You can get RH 6.0 for free, with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Red Hat's blessing (the GPL), if you have the bandwidth and the time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Or copy a friends CD.  Or clone an existing installation.  All legally.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And Red Hat expects most people to do these things.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Red Hat isn't a charity.  They're in this to make money.  If you have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a problem with that, don't give them yours.  You can use their product
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyway, and not pay them.  Or use another distro.  Or assemble your own.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You can make your own distro and and sell it.  Or copy and resell Red
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hat's.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Isn't free software wonderful?
