</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Because they are a business, and a good business makes profits.
</EM><BR>
<P>In reality a profitable business makes profits! a good business, which is
<BR>
entirely subjective, does not necessarily make any profit, gain of capital, or
<BR>
loss of capital.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, at $70 for an OS, you're at a fraction of fair market for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything approaching an equivalent OS solution...
</EM><BR>
<P>Its $80 bucks for their compilation. when u pay $1.07 &amp; 9/10 for gas are you
<BR>
just paying $1.07 or $1.08
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Okay, they didn't author the software, but they did integrate it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If I had to download, compile, install, test (integrate) all of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the packages that go into any distro, it would cost my company
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1000's of dollars of my time at each release.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you did it your self, there is no such thing as a release. Any newer
<BR>
software will be updates to existing software. Updating New releases of GLIBC,
<BR>
would be a pain though :-\
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Add to that any level of tech support (so that other admins can bug
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RedHat instead of me sometimes) and you have a real bargain.
</EM><BR>
<P>Dont forget the bigger bucks for tech support - take a look your self.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How do they spend this money?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They're investing in corporate support, RHCE, metalab, E, Alan Cox...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Things like RHCE and support don't mean alot to me, but they do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to many companies. Even if I never use them, their very existence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; adds to the commercial viability of Linux (which does mean alot to me).
</EM><BR>
<P>This is the 2'nd time A. Cox is mentioned, i this it would be unfair to
<BR>
attribute the cost increase to him - I think. In america the marketeers are
<BR>
the usual scapegoats, followed by the overly paid executive branch.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RedHat offers the sugar-coating that lets corporate America swallow Linux.
</EM><BR>
<P>Dunno about that.
