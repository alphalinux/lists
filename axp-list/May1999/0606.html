Ok...people have said some slightly less than pleasant things about 
<BR>
the Adaptec cards.
<BR>
<P>Here's my 5 cents.  I think it's heat-related.
<BR>
<P>Whenever our backup server(PowerCenter, MacOS, running Retrospect 
<BR>
with 2940UW to AIT drive) gets too hot, the card freezes up; MacOS 
<BR>
doesn't crash, and turning off the tape drive+back on again seems to 
<BR>
&quot;reset&quot; the card.  This happens very quickly, within about 10-15, 
<BR>
maybe 30 minutes of operation.
<BR>
<P>Symptom is that the red LED(bus activity indicator) stays on continuously.
<BR>
<P>Now, DEC alphas don't exactly run cool.  In fact, they run really, 
<BR>
really hot.  If you had problems with your adaptec card, try leaving 
<BR>
the side access panel off, and aim one of those little 
<BR>
fans(Duracraft, Vornado, or the like) into the interior, particularly 
<BR>
at the PCI cards(you may want to use a larger box fan to keep the 
<BR>
drive bays cool, but I find that even a little Duracraft fan moves a 
<BR>
ton of air in the general vicinity, enough to keep my Barracuda just 
<BR>
a little above room temp.)
<BR>
<P>I'd be interested to hear if anyone tries this.  I haven't heard much 
<BR>
in the way of complains on the AppleshareIP list, probably because 
<BR>
most of the systems being used for ASIP(9500, 8600, 9600, G3, B+W G3) 
<BR>
have a rather large(5 inch) low speed fan that sits right on top of 
<BR>
the PCI cards, moving air between them(an absolute must for high-end 
<BR>
video cards!)  Not to mention, PowerPC machines run cooler because, 
<BR>
among other things, the CPU uses much, much less power...
