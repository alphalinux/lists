I have Powerstorm 4D30T in my Alpha Personal Workstation 433a/au.  I have been
<BR>
trying to get an X server to run besides the XF86_Mono.  Digital is trying to
<BR>
find all of the specs on it.  I have figured out most of them.  It appears to
<BR>
have an S386C765/86C775 according to the S3 BIOS.  I have tried both of the S3
<BR>
accell. servers and I have tried the SVGA server.  All of them flash some
<BR>
color, go black and then lock up my system so that I have to reboot.  Does any
<BR>
one have a confiugration that they are using or an xserver that they've
<BR>
compiled that will support this card?  I've even looked at the commercial
<BR>
servers and they do not list it as supported.
<BR>
