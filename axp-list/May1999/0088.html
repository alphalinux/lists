<EM>&gt; Uh... I don't know if this is your problem.. but the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stuff in RH6.0 is linked with glibc 2.1 ... NOT glibc
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.0 which is what RH 5.2 comes with. If you didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; upgrade your glibc, then most packages in RH 6.0 won't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; run properly. You have two solutions, recompile the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SRPMs from RH 6.0 so that they link with the glibc you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have now.. or upgrade glibc to 2.1. (note, upgrading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; glibc to 2.1 may break other glibc 2.0 programs.. )
</EM><BR>
<P>You were right, thank you very much. I changed back to glibc 2.0 (and
<BR>
downgraded all the other rpms that I had installed from RH 6.0) and
<BR>
everything is working well again. This scares me about updating to RH 6.0! I
<BR>
have a system that has many packages that were compiled from source and are
<BR>
not registered in the rpm database (KDE comes to mind as well as all the
<BR>
kernel related stuff).
<BR>
<P>Any advice on how to go about to update to RH 6.0? Initially I was thinking
<BR>
that I could do an as needed package by package update, now doesn't seem
<BR>
such a good idea anymore ;^) What have you done to upgrade from 5.2?
<BR>
<P>Thank you,
<BR>
