<EM>&gt; Ray&gt; Being dutch, I'd like to know what's a 'dutch auction'?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ray&gt; Or are you just referring to the place of the happening?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A Dutch Auction is like a game of dare. The price starts high and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; automatically falls over time. The first person to bid gets it at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whatever the price was when they bid.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's a very swift way of selling things with little extrinsic value.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It will fail for artworks as they have little intrinsic value, but can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sold for potentially unlimited ammounts. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Named after the flower auctions in Holland, which are a sight to behold (in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; particular as two auctions take place simultaniously on the left and right
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the arena, everyone has two buttons to press!)

<P>That might be a normal dutch auction but that is not how ebay does 
<BR>
them. Wehn ebay first started you saw alot od dutch auctions but they 
<BR>
have mostly switched to yankee auctions lately. Their version of a 
<BR>
dutch auction has multiple (x) units for sale and the top x bidders 
<BR>
all get to buy at the lowest bid. Say there are 10 motherboards for 
<BR>
sale and ten people bid ranging from 50-500 dollars. At the end of 
<BR>
the auction these ten people all get to buy them at the lowest guys 
<BR>
bid of $50. The difference in the yankee format, if I remember 
<BR>
correctly, is that they all get to pay what they bid at the end.
