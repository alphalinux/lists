<EM>&gt; Running static DU binaries under AlphaLinux certainly works...

<EM>&gt; Hmmmm... is the licensing of Tru64 the same as it was with DU?

<P>DEC blew it and Compaq is not picking up.  Two parts of the company,
<BR>
hardware and software, are working against each other.  It's amazing.
<BR>
One of the best ideas, the Alpha processor, in the industry has stagnated
<BR>
completely because the companies that have owned the technology is set
<BR>
on making the little money they can on software instead of unloading the
<BR>
hardware.  What is stopping Compaq from making Alpha optimized development
<BR>
software available right now?  Man, it's pretty clear to me why DEC fell
<BR>
apart, and it's pretty clear why Compaq is, also.  I see the same thing
<BR>
happening with Sun and Java.  You know, all the great mathematicians and
<BR>
scientists are remembered for the work they did.  Very few of them made
<BR>
money -- the way Bill Gates is making money -- on the incredible work they
<BR>
did.  Yet, they still retain intellectual rights to their work.  You don't
<BR>
see anyone else but Newton and Leibnez being credited for calculus.  The
<BR>
list goes on.  
<BR>
<P>For those of us who enjoy the Alpha platform because it is technically
<BR>
superior, it's over.  I don't see Compaq ever making the right decisions
<BR>
with the platform.  That boat has long sailed.  Ugh.  Really frustrating.
<BR>
If you want optimized performance, looks like Merced is the way to go.  
<BR>
At least Intel is helping develop an optimized compiler that will
<BR>
eventually be freely available to the public for free through gcc.
<BR>
<P>It's been made clear here that it is easier to rewrite gcc for alpha 
<BR>
than to try to optimize it as is.  We are still waiting for Compaq to
<BR>
make their development environment available to us.  
<BR>
<P>Jiann-Ming Su                   &quot;People seldom do what they believe in. They do
