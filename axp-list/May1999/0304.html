Howdy -
<BR>
<P>I'm having trouble getting things (meaning Redhat Linux) going on a 
<BR>
Jensen DECpc 150. I started (and ended) by reading the install guides 
<BR>
from AlphaLinux.org and from Digital; specifically, the document at 
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.alphalinux.org/docs/jensen-install.shtml">http://www.alphalinux.org/docs/jensen-install.shtml</A> which describes an 
<BR>
install using 'aboot.'  I've been through this thing 100 times.
<BR>
<P>I did do the firmware upgrade to 1.7 like the docs say.  That went 
<BR>
fine.  But the problem is making the boot image disks and doing the 
<BR>
copyboot thing...
<BR>
<P>Every time I run copyboot it starts up and copies for a while, but then 
<BR>
it stops with a read error and gives a read error number &quot;8&quot;.  Here's 
<BR>
what I've tried:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From a DOS prompt on an NT workstation, I did a &quot;copy /b lxboot.aboot 
</EM><BR>
/b + lxboot.aboot /b + bootlx.aboot /b + vmlinux.gz image&quot; which 
<BR>
supposedly stuck those files into the file named image (duh).  I then 
<BR>
used rawrite to copy &quot;image&quot; to a diskette.  Tried to copyboot that 
<BR>
diskette, got the error.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From an Intel Linux box, I tried a &quot;cat lxboot.aboot lxboot.aboot 
</EM><BR>
bootlx.aboot vmlinux.gz &gt; /dev/fd0&quot; and then took that diskette over to 
<BR>
the Jensen.  Did the copyboot and again the error message.
<BR>
<P>I've tried using different diskettes, tried formatting the floppy under 
<BR>
Linux using &quot;fdformat /dev/fd0H1440&quot; and then re-doing the above steps. 
<BR>
&nbsp;Doesn't seem to make a difference.
<BR>
<P>I did see what would happen if I ignored the error 8 and booted the 
<BR>
system into OSF, and tried the &quot;&gt;&gt;&gt; BOOT -FL INSTALL DKA000&quot;.  Also 
<BR>
tried &quot;&gt;&gt;&gt; BOOT -FL &quot;i&quot; DKA000&quot; and several other permutations.  No 
<BR>
good.
<BR>
<P>I have gone through the Jensen-HOWTO doc available at 
<BR>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/JENSEN_INSTALL/Jensen-HOWTO.">ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/JENSEN_INSTALL/Jensen-HOWTO.</A>  
<BR>
Followed these instructions several times, too.  These instructions had 
<BR>
me make an image of a file named bootdisk.1.3.72.jensen.srm.gz and 
<BR>
follow similar instructions as the AlphaLinux doc.  When I went through 
<BR>
these instructions, the copyboot was successful.  But when I go into 
<BR>
OSF and do the &quot;&gt;&gt;&gt; BOOT -FL INSTALL DKA000&quot;, it fails.  Actually it 
<BR>
the screen blips black and it looks like it might try to do something, 
<BR>
but then it stops.  No error message but a single line of goofy 
<BR>
characters that don't mean anything to me.
<BR>
<P>The Jensen has two hard drives running off an Adaptec controller.  
<BR>
Drive 0 has two partitions -- a 4 MB boot partition and a 390-or-so MB 
<BR>
ext2 partition.  Drive 1 has two partition, too -- a 150 MB swap 
<BR>
partition and a 2 GB+ ext2 partition.  
<BR>
<P>So that's it -- not sure which docs and files I should be using, but 
<BR>
heck, neither one of them work.  What should I try now ('stick with the 
<BR>
Intel Linux box' is not the answer I'm looking for)?
<BR>
<P>thanks,
<BR>
