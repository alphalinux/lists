<P>I've run into two problems with the multias I've used.  One is that the
<BR>
power connector is *very* sensitive.  Try reseating it is seeing if that
<BR>
helps.  In my experience, it may be necessary to leave the cover off as
<BR>
putting it back on will jiggle the wires and cause them to not connect any
<BR>
more.  Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don't...
<BR>
<P>The second problem I've seen is the internal battery dying.  You can get a
<BR>
replacement easy enough, but everything will have been forgotten (disk
<BR>
partitions, boot selection, etc).
<BR>
<P>I've not actually seen one outright die.
