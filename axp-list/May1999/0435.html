<P>the SCSI spec does not as I remember spec what devices are &quot;boot&quot; devices.
<BR>
This is just a custom issue. For whatever reason the first PC SCSI cards
<BR>
seemed to pick 0 for the boot device but that is arbitrary and as for 7 as
<BR>
the host. That is not mandated. It is possible to have multiple hosts on a
<BR>
single bus.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	I have tape drive (travan, and DAT) in various machines at varying SCSI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; id's in the 4,5,6 range. AFAIK, the scsi bus prioritizes i/o requests
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; based on scsi id (please correct me if I am wrong here guys/gals) with 0
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; receiving a higher priority than 1, 1 than 2 and so on. So on a mixed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bus of hard drives and tape units, it is 'better'(but not required) to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have lower priority system devices such as tapes and cdroms sitting at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; higher numbers (such as 4,5 or 6).
</EM><BR>
<P>The SCSI commands do not have any priority based on SCSI ID. It is the
<BR>
arbitration process that uses the SCSI ID to decide who will get the bus
<BR>
when multiple masters want it. Also the prority of arbitration is 0 ==
<BR>
lowest 7 == higest. This is why the host is typicaly given ID 7. On some
<BR>
systems the boot disk is placed at ID 6. Which makes sense since you would
<BR>
want to have higher priority given to your disks over tapes and other
<BR>
devices.
<BR>
<P>So. Technicaly the way most SCSI systems are configured is wrong.
