<P>Well, I still don't know what the problem was with the module version of
<BR>
'st', but the problem appears to have been hardware related.  Evidently
<BR>
the disk was too close to the tape drive and it didn't like it.  I've
<BR>
repositioned the hard drive and the tape seems to be happy again.  I'll
<BR>
have to see if the hard drive starts acting any better (now I need to
<BR>
find a way to fill up about 1GB space ... RH 6.0 maybe?).  The next big
<BR>
test will be to put the CD-ROM burner back on top of the housing and see
<BR>
if the entire array starts flaking out or not.  Crimey...
<BR>
<P>I just wanted to thank everyone for trying to help.  If I'm ever feeling
<BR>
masochistic I might try to find out what the problem was with the 'st'
<BR>
module setup.  Chances are I'll find that I goofed something else up, so
<BR>
I'll wait a while before trying to figure that one out.  =)
