<P>
<EM>&gt; does anyone know why redhat 6.0 is up in the high $70's. Do they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; redistribute any of the profits to the developers of the software they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; publish on their compilation CD ?
</EM><BR>
<P>They employ a number of developers, and all their code is GPL'd.  These
<BR>
people are paid out of their profits, naturally.
<BR>
<P>The &quot;Official Red Hat&quot; CD includes phone support; they also sell a CD
<BR>
and manual without such support for half the price.  And, you can just
<BR>
download RH 6.0 and pay nothing, or buy one of the cheap CD's various
<BR>
companies have put together (harder to do the latter for Alpha, though).
<BR>
Or whatever.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Upgrades to windows (95,98,NT)  are in the $90 ( if u look real hard )
</EM><BR>
<P>Have you priced Windows source code recently?  Installation support?
<BR>
You're comparing apples to oranges.  You can get RH 6.0 for free, with
<BR>
Red Hat's blessing (the GPL), if you have the bandwidth and the time.
<BR>
Or copy a friends CD.  Or clone an existing installation.  All legally.
<BR>
And Red Hat expects most people to do these things.
<BR>
<P>Red Hat isn't a charity.  They're in this to make money.  If you have
<BR>
a problem with that, don't give them yours.  You can use their product
<BR>
anyway, and not pay them.  Or use another distro.  Or assemble your own.
<BR>
You can make your own distro and and sell it.  Or copy and resell Red
<BR>
Hat's.
<BR>
<P>Isn't free software wonderful?
