<EM>&gt; I for ONE am surprised, anyone else ? BTW may I ask who we is ? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Digital? Compaq? 
</EM><BR>
<P>There is no more Digital.....there is only Compaq.  And it is Compaq that
<BR>
is porting the compilers, even though the people doing it used to work for
<BR>
Digital.

<EM>&gt; Will companies be allowed to distribute the output binaries?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, we have always allowed this.  The issue of Tru64 Unix has
<BR>
always been the intellectual property in the libraries.  Since the libraries
<BR>
that the compilers link to are Linux libraries, this is a non-issue.

<EM>&gt; I'd really like to see RedHat and MetroX recompiled using this 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compiler.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ironically, you might not see the performance that you would think you would
<BR>
get, particularly inside the kernel.  It has been my experience that kernel
<BR>
programmers often program knowing what the compiler would generate, ergo
<BR>
an optimizing compiler may or may not generate significant improvements in
<BR>
speed.
<BR>
<P>User-level programs are another subject, particularly when the coder is an
<BR>
&quot;average&quot; coder.

<EM>&gt; Out of curiosity, will these compilers use Linux style ELF or retain 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the ECOFF of Tru64? 
</EM><BR>
<P>ELF.  When we started the Alpha Linux project, I was fairly animate about
<BR>
having ELF shared libraries, rather than ECOFF.  Intel Linux was ELF, and it
<BR>
seemed the way the world was going.  I figured that we would get more debuggers
<BR>
and other types of tools if we could at least have the same symbol tables and
<BR>
linking information that Intel Linux had.
<BR>
<P>And (of course) when Richard Henderson gave the Alpha Linux project ELF
<BR>
shared libraries, I was elated......and it is something that I have never,
<BR>
ever forgotten.  It is for this reason that Richard will never, ever have to
<BR>
pay for a beer in my presence.
