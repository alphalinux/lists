<EM>&gt; I haven't tried this number of mounts myself - but as some suggestions:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   1) Is there  a limit on the maximum number of mounts?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's what I thought, but I couldn't find it anywhere in the /proc area -
<BR>
even super-max (in /proc/sys/fs) was set to 256, which is the default.  I'm
<BR>
going to poke around the source tree a bit to see what I can see.  I wonder if
<BR>
it's related to the (unsuccessful) change I made to up the number of swap
<BR>
partitions to 32.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;2) There used to be an issue with the number of minor device numbers for
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; SCSI discs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      - I can't remember how big the problem was, but I wodner if you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hitting that?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shouldn't be.  Somewhere along the line in the 2.1 series I remember
<BR>
Linus sneaking in a whole bunch of new entries into the devices.txt file
<BR>
outlining major/minor pairings for up to 128 SCSI disks.  Obviously you're
<BR>
supposed to be able to do this, although maybe the intent was to use md.  Too
<BR>
bad that's probably not an option... :(
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Incidentally - what the hell are you doing with 40 discs :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think really, really big benchmarking.  Unfortunately, due to the fact that
<BR>
it's an internally hacked kit, I don't know that I'll be able to release the
<BR>
numbers.  Maybe if I say that they're not official blah blah blah...who knows.
<BR>
Suffice it to say this could be cause for some serious interest up the ladder -
<BR>
IF I can get this to work...Oh...and 40 disks might not be all.  Our resident
<BR>
filesystems performance engineer told me that we would (at least, should)
<BR>
_still_ be IO bound at 40 disks.  This system, technically, can address 4 PCI
<BR>
busses, which means 16 controllers (minus two - ethernet and video), so we have
<BR>
12 slots times at least 4 disks per controller.  _IF_  we get that far.
