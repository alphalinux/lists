Personally, I wouldn't upgrade from 5.2 to 6.0...
<BR>
especially if you have a lot of stuff that you've
<BR>
compiled yourself and linked with glibc 2.0. 
<BR>
<P>If you want the latest stuff from RH 6.0 (except glibc
<BR>
2.1)... then you can download the SRPMs and compile
<BR>
them yourself... this is what I've been doing... it
<BR>
requires a few tweaks with some code that is
<BR>
specifically for glibc 2.1... but I've gotten a lot of
<BR>
the packages from RH6.0 to work fine.
<BR>
<P>If you don't really have a reason to stay with Rh5.2,
<BR>
I would just wipe the disk and install a fresh
<BR>
RH6.0.... I've only tried RH 6.0 on Intel so far,...
<BR>
and it works well... except getting SSH2 to compile
<BR>
was a little tricky.
<BR>
<P>Or, if it just makes you feel good to &quot;think&quot; you have
<BR>
RH6.0... just update the /etc/redhat-release file.
<BR>
<P>D.

<EM>&gt; the

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; glibc
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 2.0 which is what RH 5.2 comes with. If you didn't

<EM>&gt; &gt; upgrade your glibc, then most packages in RH 6.0
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; won't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; run properly. You have two solutions, recompile
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; SRPMs from RH 6.0 so that they link with the glibc
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have now.. or upgrade glibc to 2.1. (note,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; upgrading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; glibc to 2.1 may break other glibc 2.0 programs..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; )
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You were right, thank you very much. I changed back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to glibc 2.0 (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; downgraded all the other rpms that I had installed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from RH 6.0) and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything is working well again. This scares me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about updating to RH 6.0! I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a system that has many packages that were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compiled from source and are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not registered in the rpm database (KDE comes to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mind as well as all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kernel related stuff).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Any advice on how to go about to update to RH 6.0?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Initially I was thinking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that I could do an as needed package by package
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; update, now doesn't seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such a good idea anymore ;^) What have you done to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; upgrade from 5.2?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thank you,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ZP
