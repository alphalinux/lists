Hi,
<BR>
<P>Another question to field..
<BR>
<P>I have a recently purchased UX machine, 512MB RAM with RH 5.2, whose
<BR>
kernel I upgraded to 2.2.6.  This machine seems to be randomly and
<BR>
silently killing peoples' tasks, both CPU-intensive numerical models
<BR>
and idle xterm sessions.  Of course, I haven't been able to reproduce
<BR>
it, so I'm at a loss to explain the problem.  This machine has two
<BR>
ethernet cards, the builtin one and an Intel Etherexpress 100.  There
<BR>
is a lot of nfs traffic over both cards (some of which seems to cause
<BR>
the machine to spontaneously reboot on heavy loads, but that's a
<BR>
different story), but the killing doesn't seem to be related to network
<BR>
load.
<BR>
<P>Sitting next to this machine is an LX that has been operating for over
<BR>
a year with no problems.  I initially upgraded to 2.2.x on this
<BR>
machine, but then backed off to 2.1.132 when 2.2 seemed flaky. 
<BR>
Unfortunately, I can't seem to get 2.1.132 to even compile on the UX. 
<BR>
We need 2.[12].* kernels, because we're using DU 4 binaries (we have
<BR>
licenses).
<BR>
<P>Has anyone seen anything like this?  Nothing shows up in the logs when
<BR>
tasks die.
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
