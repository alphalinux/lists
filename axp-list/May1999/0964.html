Eh?  Your mail address should be not on your local machine but on a mail
<BR>
server which stores incoming mail there.  Your client only retrieves
<BR>
mail from a server - using pop, for example.  You do not send mail with
<BR>
a help of pop.  BTW - do you know what is MX record in DNS?
<BR>
----snip----
<BR>
OK; erm - hang on a mo - I'm confused; you say that you have POP working,
<BR>
if you can't send it any mail how do you know????
<BR>
------
<BR>
I have local network at home. 3 Win98 machines and a Linux Server. I have
<BR>
DNS and Apache working. The next challenge is mail. With the tid-bit about
<BR>
imap i can now log into the server to check mail. it just says there is no
<BR>
new mail. When i send mail it connects and sends, where its sending to im
<BR>
not sure. I have MX records in DNS. Although yes send mail config. is very
<BR>
large looking. Im sure once you have a system for setting up the email you
<BR>
need its not so bad, kind of like DNS. At first DNS is &amp;%^#*!! then you get
<BR>
the idea and its not so bad. There seems to be 4 times the settings in mail.
<BR>
<P>I guess the question would be how do i get the SMTP to deposit the mail in
<BR>
the POP accounts. If that makes sense.
<BR>
<P>I hope this is a little clearer. Ill look at the /usr/lib/sendmail file
<BR>
thanks.
