<P>
Hello all,
<BR>
<P>I'd like to thank everyone who responded to me and especially
<BR>
rth@twiddle.net for trying to help figure out why my binutils package was
<BR>
not performing.  I'd like to say that I've successfully now figured it
<BR>
out!  The problem appears to have been a rogue glibc2.1 installation into
<BR>
/usr/lib.  I noticed that there were some glibc2.1 type files in that
<BR>
directory and removing them has solved the problem.
<BR>
<P>Specifically what was wrong I cannot say.  libbfd.so lives in /usr/lib
<BR>
instead of /lib; and binutils is the only package that depends on libbfd,
<BR>
making me think that was the problem.  What appears to have happened,
<BR>
though, is libbfd itself, having lived in /usr/lib, first looked in
<BR>
/usr/lib for libc.so, despite ldd reporting it looking in /lib for libc.
<BR>
<P>I believe this to be improper behavior, but I would not consider myself
<BR>
expert enough to make such a determination.  /lib is listed before
<BR>
/usr/lib in my ld.so.conf file, and my guess is that once /lib had been
<BR>
exhausted and /usr/lib was searched (for libbfd) it resumed at that point
<BR>
when trying to resolve libc, rather than restarting at the beginning of
<BR>
the search tree.
<BR>
<P>Would anyone care to comment on this assertation?  Such a change may want
<BR>
to be propogated up the tree if it is persisting in glibc 2.1 (which I do
<BR>
not want to even *think* about trying to install again!)  =)
<BR>
<P>Christopher
