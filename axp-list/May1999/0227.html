<P>The way I see it, DEC and Compaq have blown it with Alpha.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They are making their Fortran and C compilers available soon. Please
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; give credit where credit is due. This committment was made recently,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and they haven't even had a chance to not meet it.

<P>Linux can run DU binaries now.  To run some apps, you need the libraries.
<BR>
Those have been written.  It's all available.  It wouldn't take a software
<BR>
guy half a day to package it and have it on a ftp site.  What are they
<BR>
waiting on?  Until I see it, those annoucements are no different than 
<BR>
vaporware.  They were made to ride the Linux tide and cover their financial
<BR>
problems, IMO.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; For those of us who enjoy the Alpha platform because it is technically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; superior, it's over.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If it's over, then why are you posting about it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>It doesn't make sense for Intel to have 90% of the marketshare with a product
<BR>
like the Alpha.  The reason I'm posting is because I see absolutely no reason
<BR>
why Compaq can't make the libraries and development environment available
<BR>
to us now.  DEC/Compaq knew about Alpha Linux for a LONG time now.  
<BR>
If Alpha Linux wasn't working until this past Janurary, I would see their
<BR>
recent annoucement as sincere.  
<BR>
<P>I've used Linux for a long time so waiting for things to work is not new to me.
<BR>
But, when you have a technically superior platform that's being supported like
<BR>
someone's redheaded step child, it's just frustrating.  There's a reason why
<BR>
the top two guys at Compaq left... they didn't know what they were doing.
<BR>
<P>Managers... they can't make the right decisions to get out of a paper bag.
