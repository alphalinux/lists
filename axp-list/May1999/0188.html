<EM>&gt; I've had zero problems since.  The machine has been up for 7 days.

<EM>&gt; I think it was the reseat of all the connectors (power especially)

<P>This is a well-known problem with Multias. It was almost certainly the power

connectors that were the problem. I've known folks who actually re-tinned the
<BR>
fingers on the board with solder.
