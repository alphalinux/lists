[snipped the complete nonsense]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Finding intel 5.2 ( and maybe also 6.0, but at $80 a pop dealers will have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think harder to go for it  ) has been easy.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a relative term, of course.  The only nearby Linux-selling retailer to
<BR>
*me* is Best Buy (45 min drive).  I tend to do most of my software
<BR>
(and hardware) purchases mail-order.  Heck, there's not even a decent
<BR>
x86 hardware vendor locally, except for one gouge shop (over $100 for
<BR>
a plain-jane ATX case?????).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This year it has been 100% that those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; redhat blue boxes are for intel machines.
</EM><BR>
<P>This may be partly due to the observation that Redhat color-coded the
<BR>
5.1 and 5.2 boxes to the architecture they contained.  Sparc was
<BR>
red, I believe, Intel was blue, and Alpha was grey/black.  This would
<BR>
probably explain why all those blue boxes you looked at were for
<BR>
Intel. :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have not yet found a 5.2 for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alpha.
</EM><BR>
<P>Just mail order it.  It's not *that* difficult.  Do you *really*
<BR>
expect a very non-mainstream (even for Linux) distribution to get
<BR>
shelf space in Best Buy?
<BR>
<P><PRE>
