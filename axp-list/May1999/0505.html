Right, which seems like the only option left.  It seems like the onboard
<BR>
scsi is disabled with the system I have.  Is there some jumper I need
<BR>
to enable/disable to use the onboard scsi?  My co-worker has the rest
<BR>
of the manuals that came with the machine and I don't have access to
<BR>
his office during the weekends.
