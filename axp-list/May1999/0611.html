U are at liberty to inform me with some particulars, rather that the generic
<BR>
rants. Its rather easy to BS, and u appear to be no stranger. Reality will
<BR>
eventually prevail, even for those who do not observe.

<P>Finding intel 5.2 ( and maybe also 6.0, but at $80 a pop dealers will have to
<BR>
think harder to go for it  ) has been easy. This year it has been 100% that those
<BR>
redhat blue boxes are for intel machines. I have not yet found a 5.2 for the
<BR>
alpha. AND dealers that sold those Blue boxes for the alpha in the past, no longer
<BR>
do so.
<BR>
this is my reality. bizarre as you may think.

<EM>&gt; Finding 5.2 or 6.0 disks at the swap meets is EASY. And certainly finding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software for Intel or Alpha is not all that hard assuming one actually tries.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As for Alpha NT, software is easy to find. it is not as plentiful as Intel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software, but certainly not hard to find.

<EM>&gt; &gt; I suppose being on the axp-list, this particular statement has little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; creditability. If i could ever find the official release of the alpha 5.2 cd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; from a computer show, i will *probably* not find the third party software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that one could find with the 5.2/intel version.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; third party/NT/alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; software is also hard to find which probably explains why Compaq is shying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; away from desktop alpha/nt .
