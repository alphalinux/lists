<EM>&gt; I have a little problem with one of my multia's. I got the machine two weeks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ago, I installed the OS everything was ok, suddenly the machine was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dead, no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ping no telnet. After rebooting I was able to connect via telnet but after a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; few keystrokes it turned dead again. Only this time a reboot didn't help.

<P>The same thing happened to my Multia a few weeks ago.  One day, I
<BR>
opened it up to put in a PCI Ethernet card (another DEC Tulip card).
<BR>
I booted it, it worked just great.  I had eth0 and eth1, did the
<BR>
routing thing I needed it to, and decided I didn't need the card
<BR>
in there any more.  I took the card out.  I put the case back on
<BR>
and plugged the machine back into its normal place in the room.
<BR>
<P>Two days later it was dead... no video output, no network, no
<BR>
ping, no keyboard (couldn't use SysRq)--dead.  But power supply
<BR>
was still on (with fan).  I rebooted, let it fsck, and it stayed
<BR>
up for another day or two.
<BR>
<P>I got really worried, so I took it apart and left the case off
<BR>
to see if the fan by the CPU heatsink was working.  It was.  The
<BR>
CPU was quite cool, but it would still die off after a day or
<BR>
so of use (usually in the middle of the night).
<BR>
<P>5 days had passed since it first died, and I decided to unplug it,
<BR>
slide the guts tray out, reseat every component I could (including
<BR>
the power supply connector to the board) and put it back together
<BR>
solidly.  
<BR>
<P>I quickly booted and built a new kernel (I have no idea if the old
<BR>
kernel contributed to the problems, but I doubt it seeing as
<BR>
video output went away), 2.2.7pre4 with the Alpha 48-day uptime
<BR>
patches. 
<BR>
<P>I've had zero problems since.  The machine has been up for 7 days.
<BR>
I think it was the reseat of all the connectors (power especially)
<BR>
that did it.  I should mention that I had this machine for a good
<BR>
6 months before these problems, and not once did it not work as
<BR>
expected.
