For the XP1000, I think the upgrade will be a substantial cost if one wants
<BR>
a faster cache (highly recommended) since the core logic is also on the
<BR>
board. I don't know what the DS10 is..maybe you ment DS20? The DS20 will be
<BR>
fully upgradable with a simple new daughter card. It should cost less than
<BR>
a whole new system, otherwise they wouldn't sell the upgrade. The EV67
<BR>
parts will be at 667MHz and will also come with a 222MHz DDR cache (so its
<BR>
really 444MHz). DDR cache = 222MHz Address rate/444MHz Data rate. This will
<BR>
show a VAST imrovement in overall performance.....

<EM>&gt; Along the lines of Alphas and their future.  Does anyone know if the XP1000 or

<EM>&gt; the DS10's are going to be upgradeable.  The XP1000 looks to have a daughter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; card where the cpu sits, I assume the DS10 is the same.  Is it possible that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the daughter card can be upgraded when 600 mhz or EV67 versions come out?  Or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will that end up costing as much as a new system anyway??
