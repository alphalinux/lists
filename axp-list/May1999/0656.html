<P>
Certainly you appear to be no stranger to Immature rants and BS judging from the
<BR>
posting style you exibit.
<BR>
<P>Micro Center certainly stocks all Linux distributions of RedHat, and there is a neat
<BR>
little thing called a search engine Lycos, Yahoo, Infoseek etc. I assume you have
<BR>
heard of these and know how to use them?
<BR>
<P>I have yet to see a swap meet in southern california where one could not find plenty
<BR>
of Linux variety available for sale at reasonable prices.
<BR>
<P>Alternatively you can try
<BR>
<P>Cheap Bytes
<BR>
<P>Linux System Labs
<BR>
<P>Linux Mall
<BR>
<P>to name 3 mail order places. There are more but your attitude certainly does not bear
<BR>
going out of my way to help.
<BR>
<P>The next time you want to rant ignorantly, try making sure you know what you are
<BR>
talking about first.

<EM>&gt; Finding intel 5.2 ( and maybe also 6.0, but at $80 a pop dealers will have to

<EM>&gt; alpha. AND dealers that sold those Blue boxes for the alpha in the past, no longer

<EM>&gt; do so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this is my reality. bizarre as you may think.
