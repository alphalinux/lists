My last experience with traders was with trying to buy an smp/intel with
<BR>
ECC memory. Lots heard of 2 cpu's ( dont sell it though ), and ECC was a
<BR>
&quot;whats that&quot;. Alpha's are just not on their event horizon.

But a store manager might just buy one ( because its there to sell ),
<BR>
BUT its at list price.
