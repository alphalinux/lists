Jay,
<BR>
<P>I'll give it a try with the kernel you mention below and let you know
<BR>
what happens.  I think that the generic.img file shipped with Red Hat 6.0 alpha
<BR>
is using 2.2.5, which is newer than the 2.2.3 you mention below.
<BR>
<P>Thanks.
<BR>

&gt; &gt; I'm trying to install Red Hat 6.0 on a DS20.  I'm using the default images
&gt; &gt; from the distribution.  I have the ncr53c875 scsi controller on this
&gt; &gt; machine.  Every time I boot with the installation disk, the &quot;ncr53c8xx&quot;
&gt; &gt; driver is used.  However, this driver seems to timeout after resetting
&gt; &gt; the scsi bus.  I have this same card on my pc but I'm using the &quot;sym53c8xx&quot;
&gt; &gt; driver and I've had no problems.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My question is: how do I get the installation setup to use the &quot;sym53c8xx&quot;
&gt; &gt; driver instead of the &quot;ncr53c8xx&quot; driver?
&gt; 
&gt; You don't, as it was not built into the DP264 aka DS20 kernel on RH 5.2.
&gt; In fact, it wasn't even available then; check the kernel output, I think
&gt; you'll see it was based on 2.1.120 or some such, over 6 months old.
&gt; 
&gt; But I think you have two options:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. that old kernel didn't work well with that SCSI card on the second PCI
&gt;    bus, so you could simply move it into one of the top slots and try again.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. run with the 2.2.3 kernel found on getekeeper.dec.com at:
&gt; 
&gt; 	/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/Images/generic-up-223.img	# floppy image file
