<EM>&gt;         In another Linux system I got strange messages about bad blocks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from mke2fs, but: it must be the SCSI hardware, the drive is new and works
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fine in some other Linux system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         So: check your SCSI hardware!
</EM><BR>
<P>I have thought about that as well.  It's actually rather
<BR>
interesting/fragile.  The tape lives just below a seagate hard drive
<BR>
that is starting to give me trouble.  But the hard drive gets *very* hot
<BR>
and only at a certain capacity, so I think that it's just flaky (even
<BR>
though it too is new).  The IBM hard drive below the tape is working
<BR>
fine, as it has been for some years now.  I also have a cd-rom burner
<BR>
that makes the whole subsystem freak out if I move it too close to the
<BR>
hard drive while it is powered on.  It's in an external case that sits
<BR>
on top of the other devices in another case.  As long as there about 1&quot;
<BR>
of foam padding under the burner, all is well.
<BR>
<P>It seems unlikely to me that it's a hardware issue with respect to
<BR>
loading the driver since the code works when not compiled as a module,
<BR>
but the initial media error that set thing whole thing off may need to
<BR>
be looked into.  Termination, etc, should all be fine - nothing is
<BR>
terminated except the IBM hard drive sitting at device 0.
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
