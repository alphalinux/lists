Hello,
<BR>
<P>I have a little problem with one of my multia's. I got the machine two weeks
<BR>
ago, I installed the OS everything was ok, suddenly the machine was
<BR>
dead, no
<BR>
ping no telnet. After rebooting I was able to connect via telnet but after a
<BR>
few keystrokes it turned dead again. Only this time a reboot didn't help.
<BR>
<P>There is no screen output I supose no video signal, nothing, the fan is
<BR>
still running, is this the well know'n heat death?
<BR>
<P>Is there anything I can do? I am situated in Germany maybe somebody has some
<BR>
addresses for spare parts.
<BR>
<P><P><PRE>
