As I said, alpha stuff is harder to find if at all, maybe you should address your naiveté
<BR>
to the i386 group. your failure to recognize this is exceeding short sighted. Stores are
<BR>
plentiful, as u so admirably point out. My task to u was to list and find the alpha
<BR>
software. Other people got the message, why cant you!

<EM>&gt; &gt; U are at liberty to inform me with some particulars, rather that the generic

<EM>&gt; &gt; Finding intel 5.2 ( and maybe also 6.0, but at $80 a pop dealers will have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; think harder to go for it  ) has been easy. This year it has been 100% that those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; redhat blue boxes are for intel machines. I have not yet found a 5.2 for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; alpha. AND dealers that sold those Blue boxes for the alpha in the past, no longer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; do so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; this is my reality. bizarre as you may think.
