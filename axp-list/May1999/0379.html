Thanks, friends --
<BR>
<P>That worked! I got the aboot prompt and did the &quot;0/a root=/dev/fd0 
<BR>
load_ramdisk=1&quot;.
<BR>
<P>But...
<BR>
<P>It soon asked me:
<BR>
<P>&quot;VFS: insert root floppy disk to be loaded into ramdisk and press enter&quot;
<BR>
<P>I took the file named ramdisk.img from the RH6 alpha distribution and 
<BR>
dd'ed it onto a floppy.  So I stuck it in, and hit enter, and got this:
<BR>
<P>RAMDISK: Compressed image found at block 0
<BR>
[MSDOS FS Rel. 12,FAT 0,check=n,conv=b,uid=0,umask=022,bmap]
<BR>
Kernel: unaligned trap at fffffc................[gibberish]
<BR>
Translation block size = 512
<BR>
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 01:00
<BR>
<P><P><P>The Alpha has two hard drives:
<BR>
<P>sda: type 8
<BR>
&nbsp;sectors/unit: 832527
<BR>
<P>partition 1: ext2, cyls 0-7
<BR>
partition 2: ext2, cyls 8-813
<BR>
<P>sdb: type 8
<BR>
&nbsp;sectors/unit: 4110480
<BR>
<P>partition 1: swap, cyls 0-199
<BR>
partition 2: ext2, cyls 200-4014
<BR>
<P><P><P>So do you think my ramdisk is not correct or could it be my partition 
<BR>
schema? 
<BR>
<P>Thanks again,

<EM>&gt; I'm having trouble getting things (meaning Redhat Linux) going on a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jensen DECpc 150. I started (and ended) by reading the install guides 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from AlphaLinux.org and from Digital; specifically, the document at 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.alphalinux.org/docs/jensen-install.shtml">http://www.alphalinux.org/docs/jensen-install.shtml</A> which describes 
</EM><BR>
an 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; install using 'aboot.'  I've been through this thing 100 times.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I did do the firmware upgrade to 1.7 like the docs say.  That went 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fine.  But the problem is making the boot image disks and doing the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; copyboot thing...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Every time I run copyboot it starts up and copies for a while, but 
</EM><BR>
then 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; it stops with a read error and gives a read error number &quot;8&quot;.  Here's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what I've tried:
</EM><BR>
<P>[snip]
<BR>
<P>Sounds like the Jensen floppy has reverted to being a 2.88 drive. I had 
<BR>
a
<BR>
problem with copyboot and the solution was to tell SRM about the drive.
<BR>
Note that this involves going SET OS NT (or similar), entering SRM,
<BR>
changing and saving the floppy config and reselecting OSF boot method.
<BR>
<P>I have a working Jensen (running Debian), now if only I could get that
<BR>
Ethernet card working...
<BR>
<P>Just in case: you know about sync when writing to raw floppies, right?
<BR>
<P>Good luck!
<BR>
Giuliano.
