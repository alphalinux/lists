Hello Linux/Alpha community,
<BR>
<P>We've been having some problems with RedHat 6.0 and MILO lately on our
<BR>
AlphaServer 1000 4/233.  Our 4 GB SCSI disk has a small (4 MB) DOS partition
<BR>
with the following on it:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;loadlin.exe (from the RedHat 6.0 distribution tree)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mikasa (a file containing MILO from the RedHat 6.0 distribution tree)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mikasa2 (the latest MILO from genie.ucd.ie)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;milo (the latest MILO in the 'mikasa' directory on gatekeeper.dec.com)
<BR>
In short, none of the MILOes do what we want them to.
<BR>
<P>'mikasa' and 'mikasa2' have several problems. Perhaps most confusing is that
<BR>
their syntax seems to be slightly different from the syntax described in the
<BR>
MILO Howto - the variables are altered, disk names must always be specified
<BR>
with a colon suffix (e.g. sda2: - it is unclear how the 'boot sda2 linux' as
<BR>
described in the Redhat 6.0 Alpha Installation Addendum is supposed to work),
<BR>
and so on. Furthermore, if we try to boot the system with a path or from the
<BR>
boot: prompt as follows:
<BR>
<P>boot: linux
<BR>
boot: boot/vmlinuz
<BR>
boot: boot/vmlinuz-2.2.5-16
<BR>
<EM>MILO&gt; boot sda2:boot/vmlinuz
</EM><BR>
<EM>MILO&gt; boot sda2:boot/vmlinuz-2.2.5-16
</EM><BR>
<P>the screen blinks briefly and MILO just reboots. What DOES work is to
<BR>
specify the uncompressed kernel image, as in
<BR>
<P><EM>MILO&gt; boot sda2:boot/vmlinux-2.2.5-16
</EM><BR>
<P>but we'd really rather it boot the compressed image specified in
<BR>
/etc/milo.conf (this file is not modified - it is RedHat's own) so that
<BR>
kernel updates are quick and painless.
<BR>
<P>'milo' has fewer problems, in that it will boot the linux image described in
<BR>
/etc/milo conf and seems to match the syntax described in the MILO Howto.
<BR>
The one thing it will not do is boot that image automatically when passed
<BR>
the argument 'boot sda2 linux' by the ARC console or from the prompt. It
<BR>
instead sits at the boot: prompt after telling us that 'linux' is one of the
<BR>
available images.
<BR>
<P>My questions are:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I stop the new versions of MILO from rebooting themselves?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I get both versions of MILO to boot the image specified as 'linux'
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in /dev/sda2's /etc/lilo.conf automatically?
<BR>
<P><P>Thanks a lot,
<BR>
--Tom
