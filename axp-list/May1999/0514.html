I'm hoping the hardware is okay.  The configuration is &quot;as is&quot; shipped
<BR>
from Compaq.  NT was preinstalled and working fine, not that means much.
<BR>
Could it be this card?  It has two channels and an integrated network
<BR>
interface (looks ike a DE500-AA).
<BR>
<P>I've tried pulling everything off the card and when the driver initializes,
<BR>
the card _still_ times out.  Weird huh?
<BR>
<P>Compaq's web page with Linux info lists this card as tested to work.

&gt;   Okay, I just tried the 2.2.3 Red Hat 5.2 generic image that you suggested.
&gt;   That also picks the ncr53c8xx driver and that too times out after the
&gt;   scsi bus resets.
&gt;   
&gt;   I would prefer to use the 875.  I guess I might need to run the drives
&gt;   off the motherboard.
&gt;   
&gt;   Any suggestions?  Can a Red Hat 6.0 image file be made with the syn53c8xx
&gt;   driver?
&gt;   
&gt; you sure the hardware is ok? i've had no problems with either the ncr
&gt; or the sym drivers with a sym 875. have you checked termination,
&gt; cables, id conflicts?
