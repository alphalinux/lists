<P>
FWIW, the product name is actually &quot;AlphaServer 400 4/233&quot;, and it is an
<BR>
Avanti, sold as a server.  The project name for this was &quot;Chinet&quot;, to go
<BR>
along with the dishware theme long used by the Alpha volume server group
<BR>
over the years; this started with &quot;Mikasa&quot;, the AlphaServer 1000 4/200.
<BR>
Product developers referred to the card containing the EV4 and APECS
<BR>
chip set as the &quot;CPU module&quot;, and you could configure the box to accept
<BR>
an Intel-based module.  Digital did try, for volume platforms, to use
<BR>
common components to make Alpha- and Intel-based systems, where
<BR>
possible.

<P><P><P>It is, in fact, an Avanti-class machine.  The MILO image you want is
<BR>
'/milo/images/avanti.img'.
<BR>
<P>Linux runs well on the Avanti's.  The CPU does sit on a riser card; if
<BR>
you
<BR>
look at the backplane board, you will notice jumpers that say
<BR>
&quot;alpha/intel' and the like on them.  That way, DEC could use the same
<BR>
casing, backplane board, drives, etc... with an Intel riser card.
<BR>
<P>As for hardware, I've had good luck with Toshiba CDROM's, Quantum and 
<BR>
Seagate drives, and Matrox Millenium (I/II) and S3 graphics cards.  
<BR>
<P>As always. YMMV. ;-)

<EM>&gt; For some reason I had a difficult time determining which milo image

<EM>&gt; to use for the AlphaServer 400 4/33.  (I think that's the name.)  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looked like avanti.  Could someone confirm?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, I trust that Linux will work on this machine.  I believe it uses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a 21064 @233MHz.  I took a peek inside one that I might be getting and
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; it looked like the CPU was on a special proprietary riser card.  Other
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; Anyone have Linux running on such a machine?  I have a Multia, and
</EM><BR>
since

components.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Any tips for an AS 400?
