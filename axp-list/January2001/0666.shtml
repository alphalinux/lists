<P>
Michal,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;This &quot;automatic&quot; stuff I did not try.  I always had something else
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on a test machine which I was not going to risk.  But - /boot does 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not have to be a separate partition.  It might be but this is not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a requirement.  Maybe you are mixing things with a small FAT partition 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which is holding bits and pieces for milo?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm using SRM 5.8.1, not AlphaBIOS, so no FAT SYSTEM partition.  I
<BR>
completely blew away the partition table and rebooted before making a new
<BR>
attempt at installing and partitioning (good general practice across all
<BR>
platforms). 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  - 'anaconda' is very cautious when writing a boot block.  Probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    a tad overcautious but this is better then a possiblitiy of loosing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    your data.
</EM><BR>
<P>Any schmuck who doesn't backup before doing upgrades and rebuilds deserves
<BR>
to lose partitions (I speak from experience). : )
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  - It is quite trivial to write that bootloader _after_ the whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    installation if you are really sure that there is a space for it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I used SWRITEBOOT repeatedly, but apparently the partition was hosed and it
<BR>
refused to write anything.  Rebuild using the above mentioned procedure was
<BR>
followed time and time again.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It did not leave space or a bootloader was not automatically written?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;These are two different things.  Frankly I do not know what Disk Druid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will do when it will find an already existing partition table.
</EM><BR>
<P>No partition tables were present, I NUKED 'EM and rebooted.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If you have a separate /boot then 'aboot.conf' file will have to live on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this partition as well.  Minor, but worth to remember.
</EM><BR>
<P>Checked and confirmed repeatedly, eventually I knew every bit of syntax and
<BR>
option. I can rewrite the whole file in my sleep.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;&gt;From your description it looks like that you were possibly at the very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;end save a small step.  Hard to be sure.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's what I thought.  Just an exercise in learning the more intimate
<BR>
details of BSD partitioning.
<BR>
<P><P>Did you file a detailed report on <A HREF="http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla?">http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla?</A>
<BR>
<P>At the time, I didn't know if that would do any good.  Reporting bugs had
<BR>
always been something of a one-sided affair in the bygone days of Alpha/NT.
<BR>
I have yet to get one useful bit of technical support (at $250.00 per hour)
<BR>
from MS tech support. By the time I run out of ideas, KNOW ONE seems to
<BR>
know, at least on NT.  Self-support with a major price tag.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Is not a bad policy but I am a bit confused.  In one place you said that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Disk Druid was from RH 7 and in the other that this was 9 month ago.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That Disk Druid was not available at that time.  Maybe I misunderstood
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;something?
</EM><BR>
<P>You'd be right on that, no Disk Druid yet. I did an &quot;automatic&quot; with the
<BR>
workstation configuration trashing everything on disk (if there was
<BR>
anything, usually not) and building a 10MB /boot, a 16MB /SWAP and a
<BR>
variable / filling up the disk. I was highly reluctant to use FDISK to do
<BR>
the work myself. I only created /boot as a separate partition because I
<BR>
wanted to follow OSF/1 conventions I learned from my first Digital UNIX
<BR>
class and of course ARC conventions (NT) which dictate a small bootstrap
<BR>
partition as part of the spec.  Both are &quot;optional&quot; because you can easily
<BR>
install the bootstrap program onto the same partition as the OS install,
<BR>
with some restrictions and some loss of flexibility.  NT would have to run
<BR>
in a FAT portion, Digital UNIX would have to share the same UFS.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;An output of 'fdisk -l' _may_ clear up something or maybe you do have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problems with reading your disks.  It is hard to guess.
</EM><BR>
<P>FDISK -L did what again? I would just wipe, write the cleaned partition-free
<BR>
config, quit, reboot and start all over.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If you are using 'fdisk' then make sure that this is rather new version.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There were miscounting problems with fdisk on BSD type partitioning in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the past.
</EM><BR>
<P>I used whatever 5.2, 6.0 and 7.0 ship with. I didn't even go hunt down the
<BR>
latest aboot (even though the latest is still technical beta).  I was not
<BR>
yet in the know.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;You definitely do not have to switch between the two.  The whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;installation can be done with one or another and definitely with fdisk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only (there was a lot of Alphas running Linux before Disk Druid showed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;up on a scene :-).
</EM><BR>
<P>What is the best method for setting the mount point from FDISK? I attempted
<BR>
to determine this from the installation guide, but this was not very
<BR>
helpful.
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
<P>--KE
