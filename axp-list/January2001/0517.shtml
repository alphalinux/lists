<EM>&gt; one of the RedHat folks made some comments that seem to be contrary.

<EM>&gt; I thought that I would ask you to clarify what you meant, and help us

<EM>&gt; figure out what you really meant.
</EM><BR>
<P>Basically, we have two different versions of &quot;gcc-2.96&quot;.
<BR>
<P>There's the original RH-7.0 gcc-2.96, and that one is known to be broken.
<BR>
People can still use it, but we _know_ for example that it miscompiles at
<BR>
least reiserfs on x86. It so happens that it probably is better on Alpha,
<BR>
because the bugs are less likely to show up on alpha (&quot;long long&quot; is same
<BR>
as &quot;long&quot;, and not nearly the same kind of register pressure anyway), but
<BR>
in any case it's something to be avoided unless you just cannot find
<BR>
anything else.
<BR>
<P>There's the _other_ gcc-2.96. This is the current redhat compiler if you
<BR>
update to their rawhide (or whatever their beta is called), I think they
<BR>
name the RPM something like gcc-2.96-96, as opposed to tbe original
<BR>
2.96-57. Or something. This other gcc doesn't have any _known_ bugs, and
<BR>
I'd actually be fairly interested in hearing what happens with it.
<BR>
<P>In addition to this simple issue of two 2.96 compilers is another, fairly
<BR>
practical issue: it's clear that RH can't just go back to 2.95.2 or
<BR>
anything like that. Once they released with gcc-2.96, they were kind of
<BR>
stuck. For political as well as just technical reasons (ie now they have
<BR>
all the libraries compiled with the 2.96 C++ calling conventions etc, so
<BR>
it's more pain than it's worth to backtrack). So I entirely understand RH
<BR>
wanting to stay with 2.96. Which is ok as long as it's a _fixed_ 2.96.
<BR>
<P>Right now, the fixed (as opposed to the originally shipping) gcc-2.96
<BR>
actually seems to not only have had no known bugs found, but it's known to
<BR>
also _not_ miscompile some stuff that older, more &quot;stable&quot; compilers get
<BR>
wrong. Now, the kernel has worked around those issues, so that's not a big
<BR>
deal per se, but it's a good sign of the stability of the compiler itself.
<BR>
<P>So I'm basically still of the opinion that it was incredibly stupid of RH
<BR>
to ship with an unproven compiler without even asking the gcc steering
<BR>
committee. But what's done is done, and apart from lambasting them on the
<BR>
'net in order to hopefully shame them into not doing the same mistake in
<BR>
the near future, there's nothing I or anybody else can do about that. So
<BR>
the best action is to just grumble a bit, and live with it, and work at
<BR>
making sure that the newer 2.96 compilers are _solid_.
<BR>
<P>I doubt we'll see a real gcc-3.0 release for some time yet, and even when
<BR>
it comes it will take time to stabilize, so we'll probably live with the
<BR>
2.96 series for at least half a year. Could be more. And the more people
<BR>
that bite the bullet, the better. As long as people are aware of the
<BR>
inherent risk in testing new compilers. Even if that risk looks fairly
<BR>
small with the new 2.96-version.
