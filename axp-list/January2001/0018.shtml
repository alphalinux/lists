<P>
It seems that we have a similar setup for installing RedHat Alpha on Multias. I do
<BR>
use Slackware on my x86, though :-)
<BR>
<P>Anyhow, the way I was able to net-install RH (5.2, 6.0 and 6.2) on the Multia was
<BR>
through using the x86 machine with an apache server pointing to the CDROM with
<BR>
RedHat on. When attempting to use ftp I always got the error you describe, but at
<BR>
least in 5.2 and 6.0 it was also related to a bad tulip driver when using the
<BR>
10Base2 port (BNC). Now I finally got an inverted cable to use on the 10BaseT port
<BR>
(RJ45) so I don't know if it is still the case for 6.2 (a transmitter on the
<BR>
AUI port, converting to BNC was what I used then).
<BR>
<P>Also, you should make sure that the httpd server (apache?) is actually working and
<BR>
providing access to the CDROM where you expect it. This might seem as an insult to
<BR>
you, but something I at some times didn't check when I should have and it didn't
<BR>
actually work (having only one monitor and switching back and forth helps with the
<BR>
confusion:-)
<BR>
<P>And finally, do you know that during the RedHat installation you can switch
<BR>
virtual terminals (F1 through F4 I believe) and from there see better information
<BR>
about what is going on during the installation. That will help you debug your
<BR>
installproblems.
<BR>
<P>I don't know if any of this was news, but those were what came to my mind when I
<BR>
read your email.
<BR>
<P>Have fun,
<BR>

<P><EM>&gt; hey there, im trying to get redhat 6.2 running on my multia.  this is a basic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; multia setup, but its all basically never used hardware (ruling out the heat

<EM>&gt; death).  ive got an external scsi hard drive/cdrom that im trying to install

<EM>&gt; to/with.  here is my problem:

<EM>&gt; everything boots fine, but the install program dies with the error &quot;unable to

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; local image, http, and ftp from 4 different sources.  this is unbeleivably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discouraging, and i am very new to the alpha architecture, so it is likely that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; im doing something wrong, i just dont know what.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hopefully someone has had this problem and knows a solution, as i have tried
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything that makes sense to me.  any help would be very appreciated.
