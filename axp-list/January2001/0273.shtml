<EM>&gt; &gt; Is is possible to install RedHat Linux 6.2 on an alpha system, with

<EM>&gt; &gt; console over serial -- or just with a graphical console?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yes, just add console=ttyS0 to your boot flags.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually I do not think that you need to do that - at least with some
<BR>
versions of an SRM console.  In an absence of keyboard/graphics card
<BR>
a console i/o gets redirected to a serial line automagically.
<BR>
<P>In some of my tests it was even _better_ not to do this 'console=...'
<BR>
stuff.  If I did then a console was &quot;silent&quot; until I was getting
<BR>
'login: ' prompt all of sudden.  Without that I had a full complement
<BR>
of boot messages on my screen and that can be easily captured with
<BR>
various terminal emulator programs in a case of troubles.
