<P>
Nikos,
<BR>
<P>UP2000 and UP2000 plus use the same Tsunami 21272 chipset (83.5MHz, 300+MHz
<BR>
system interface, memory point to point ports from 128 bits to 256bits) as
<BR>
the API DP264 and Compaq's DS20/DS20E.  The biggest distinction between
<BR>
UP2000/UP2000+ and the DP264/AlphaServer DS20 is the Slot B cartridge used
<BR>
on Alpha Processor Inc. (API NetWorks, more recently) motherboards as
<BR>
opposed to the proprietary CPU cards used in Compaq wares.  Additionally,
<BR>
the UP2000/UP2000+ has fewer DSW (&quot;D&quot;) chips for interfacing the memory, so
<BR>
the channels are narrower than DP264/DS20 though the memory port runs at the
<BR>
same frequency as the CIA controller, 83.5MHz. 
<BR>
<P>DP264/DS20 systems have a 5.2GBps main memory bandwidth aggregated between
<BR>
two 2.6GBps ports (256bit each).  DP264/DS20 also has more PCI slots (6) and
<BR>
all of them are 64 bit.  UP2000/UP2000+ uses half as many DSW, so its main
<BR>
memory performance is 2.6GBps (1.3GBps per 128bit memory channel).  Making
<BR>
up for this, the UP2000+ (the UP2000 is EOL and has been replaced by the
<BR>
fully software configurable &quot;+&quot; model) supports much more recent vintage
<BR>
CPUs (EV68, EV69 soon) on Slot B cartridges with up to 8MB of
<BR>
high-throughput DDR HSTL SSRAM. Cache bandwidth on these new parts is
<BR>
8GBps+. Compaq ships some of its DS20E systems with 8MB cache on their
<BR>
proprietary cartidges, but neither the DS20E nor DP264 support CPUs faster
<BR>
than the 667MHz EV67 (21264A) with 4MB of HSTL cache. DP264/DS20 machines
<BR>
are also unique in that they use a &quot;traditional&quot; RISC-style memory
<BR>
format-200 pin registered ECC SDRAM DIMMS. The UP2000x uses much more
<BR>
available and less costly 168pin registered ECC SDRAM, though its max memory
<BR>
capacity is lower than the DP264/DS20.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;From NT's perspective, both systems use the same HAL and share most of the
</EM><BR>
same board devices and system drivers (Adaptec SCSI, National SuperIO, etc).
<BR>
Same goes for Linux which uses the same &quot;system variant&quot; information in the
<BR>
build of the kernel. I believe the XP1000 shares this architecture since it
<BR>
has a 256bit main memory port, is Tsunami based and may even use the same
<BR>
processor boards as the DS20 (can't verify that).
<BR>
<P>Be prepared to shell out a good $7,000 for a board/CPU(s) and associated
<BR>
memory for either DP264 or UP2000+.  A licensed VAR could obtain and build
<BR>
one for less and provide support for it as well.  DCG, Hard Data, Aspen
<BR>
Systems and Microway are all good choices, though you'll pay a price premium
<BR>
for their knowledge.

<BR>
<P><P>Hi,
<BR>
<P>Is UP2000 a Jensen or a DP264 (or something else?)
<BR>
Anyone with a definite answer?
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
