I have recently configured an Intel architecture dual head Matrox G450 (AGP) video card for a customer and we are having trouble getting it to work.  I knew this was coming.  The beta release from Matrox does not seem to support the G450!??  I need to know if anyone has had any luck getting this card to work under Redhat 7.0?  If so, please tell me the driver, kernel revision and how you configured it.  Of course, the card would need to be able to run at it's full potential.  The person that comes up with this solution will be quite the hero.  We have many universities and gov't labs that are requiring better graphics performance along with all the bells and whistles (ie dual head, TV out).
<BR>
<P>Many thanks in advance for your hard work.
