<P><EM>&gt;Actually the largest 1&quot; now available are the IBM and Seagate 73GB in

<EM>&gt;controllers. An example of this is the DP264 planar board ( same as

<EM>&gt;used in our Hard Data DP264 and Compaq DS20 machines) but these are far
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from 1U.  6U is the typical rack form factor of those.  We find no

<EM>&gt;Of course you could also buy Compaq ES40 machines and get over 4GB. And
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for the cost of those machines you could also buy a Rolls Royce and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have the data driven to Florida..  But they aren't 1U either.  In terms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of rackspace versus power the CS-20 is about as dense as one can buy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nowadays,
</EM><BR>
<P>This is the conclusion I kind of came to myself earlier.  In addition
<BR>
to the greater capacity, I like the large memory bus that the DP264
<BR>
gets from the dual controllers.  However, I'm wondering if it can run
<BR>
CPUs at greater than 667 MHz.  It seems to me that if there is twice
<BR>
the memory bandwidth, the bus should be able to support faster CPUs.
<BR>
<P>Yes, I am looking for the most compute power per cubic volume, but I
<BR>
also need lots of memory as well (don't we all?).  Like a lot of other
<BR>
problems, ours become less efficient as the data is distributed due to
<BR>
the higher percentage of the time moving the data among the processors,
<BR>
instead of actually processing them.
<BR>
<P>Actually, Sun's new US-III blade 1000 workstations can hold up to 8GB
<BR>
to support 2 CPUs.  Too bad their performance are a little low, and
<BR>
their availability is somewhat scarce (due to chip yield problems, I
<BR>
hear).
<BR>
<P>Thanks for your reply.
