<P>
Michal,
<BR>
<P>Thanks Michal for your reply.  Here is some background:
<BR>
<P>When installing Linux via a CD install from a fully SCSI (Qlogic 1040B)
<BR>
based PWS 600au (SRM 5.8.1), I allowed a &quot;fully automatic&quot; partitioning
<BR>
using the &quot;Workstation&quot; installation option.  When I rebooted upon
<BR>
installing all of my desired packages, the /boot partition had not been
<BR>
created properly and the aboot bootloader had not been installed.
<BR>
<P>I then performed a manual install using Disk Druid, created a 20MB /boot
<BR>
(sda1) a 256MB /SWAP (sda2) and a 8548MB / (sda3). Disk Druid supposedly
<BR>
knows not to use the first cylinder for the first partition to avoid
<BR>
overwriting the SRM bootstrap (or preventing it from being written), but
<BR>
When I completed with the installation and rebooted, I found that it had
<BR>
once again failed.
<BR>
<P>I performed an identical install in TEXT mode but did not get any further.
<BR>
<P>The next time I attempted an install, I switched to one of the consoles
<BR>
showing the status of the disk partitioning and formatting using CNTRL+ALT
<BR>
F1-F5.  I completed the installation from GUI and switched to the second or
<BR>
third virtual console to see what the status was.  It read &quot;unable to read
<BR>
partition, failed&quot; or something similar (this was 9 months ago).  The GUI
<BR>
had formatted the partitions as instructed but something was still obviously
<BR>
very wrong.
<BR>
<P>I checked my cabling, replaced the controller with a different controller (a
<BR>
Qlogic 1080 64bit controller), replaced the cabling (Granite Digital 68pin
<BR>
Silver/teflon ribbons, the best on earth) replaced the drive, turned off
<BR>
termination on the disk and used a diagnostic active terminator (Granite
<BR>
Digital, LVD rated) on the end of the bus and placed the CD-ROM drive,
<BR>
SLS-120 and Panasonic DVD-RAM/ROM/CD-R on the legacy 1040B controller. I
<BR>
performed an identical install and checked the status of my partition
<BR>
building and formatting attempts along the way.  Same issue.
<BR>
<P>The last time I did the installation, I chose FDISK and changed the options
<BR>
per some old archives off the axp-list (circa 1998).  I created a 20MB /boot
<BR>
partition and toggled some options for the BSD labels, switched to sector
<BR>
mode (option &quot;u&quot; I think it was) created a 256MB /SWAP partition and a
<BR>
8438MB / partition.  I saved the changes (&quot;w&quot; to commit) and waited for the
<BR>
IO message to complete.  I then quit the program, chose &quot;sda&quot; again and
<BR>
verified the changes with a &quot;p&quot; to print the partition table.  This time
<BR>
everything looked fine, though I still was going to need mount points,
<BR>
according to the post.
<BR>
<P>I rebooted the system, restarted the installation and used Disk Druid to set
<BR>
the mount points on my partitions.  This time everything installed fine.  I
<BR>
have since ALWAYS built my partitions in FDISK and created the mount points
<BR>
in Disk Druid.  This is far from a clean solution but at least on two of my
<BR>
Alpha systems (1 PWS 600au, 1 OEM home-grown 164LX-4, both running SRM
<BR>
5.8.1) with similar hardware (Qlogic 1040B, Qlogic 1080 SCSI controllers,
<BR>
one dedicated to SLS-120, CD-ROM and DVD-RAM/DVD-ROM/CD-R device, the 1080
<BR>
being for 1 or 2 9 or 18.2GB U2 disks) the &quot;automatic&quot; installations and
<BR>
&quot;manual&quot; installations always failed or the /boot partition could not be
<BR>
read properly and the swriteboot command never issued to write the boot
<BR>
block and Aboot bootstrap program.  If its my procedure, I'm not sure what
<BR>
I'm doing wrong.  SCSI buses 1 and 2 are totally rock solid with everything
<BR>
in the bus showing clean REQ/ACK without resends or bad termination (beauty
<BR>
of the diagnostic terminator).
<BR>
<P><P>Maybe a more &quot;new user&quot; friendly version of FDISK with more descriptive help
<BR>
and better examples would make this process easier.  Having to switch from
<BR>
FDISK to Disk Druid to cover both parts of the install seems excessively
<BR>
complex.  My UltraSPARC IIi SPARCEngine based machine (home grown) and the
<BR>
Sun Ultra 30 did not have such a difficult time with Red Hat Linux on SPARC
<BR>
(UltraLinux), even though they have very similar firmware/partitioning
<BR>
requirements. The Red Hat/Mandrake/SuSe installation instructions were
<BR>
extremely sparse in this regard.  I have sent recommendations for
<BR>
documentation improvement as they are ambiguous when one gets into as much
<BR>
trouble as I did.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>

<P>Hm, I certainly cannot claim to see every possible situation but I did

try some &quot;naive test&quot; installations using exactly this Disk Druid you

mention and Alpha with an SRM console.  Maybe this is not the way I
<BR>
would do a serious installation, mostly because I want to have more

control on what is happening with my disk, but I do not recally any

show-stopper issues.  What precisely is what got in your way and why do

you think that this was Disk Druid at fault?
