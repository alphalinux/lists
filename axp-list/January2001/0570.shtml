<P>it's called em86.  it's about 5 years old by now.  it's based on the
<BR>
technology of fx!32, which compaq included with alpha WinNT, so that you
<BR>
could run intel winodws binaries on alpha NT.  fx!32 was successful as an
<BR>
emulator (although there is some argument that it contributed to the death
<BR>
of alpha NT because nobody ported any applications).  em86 runs intel
<BR>
linux binaries in alpha linux.  em86 was much slower than fx!32 however,
<BR>
because it didnt recompile the applications, but instead just emulated,
<BR>
instruction-by-instruction.  typically, it will run intel linux apps about
<BR>
as fast as a 486 on a fast EV56 machine.  for that reason, it was never
<BR>
very useful.  to make it work, you need a binary kit from compaq for which
<BR>
source is not available.  you also need to compile the right option into
<BR>
the kernel and you need all the shared libraries from an x86 linux box.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; would be great if the source is free!
</EM><BR>
<P>sorry ... no such luck.  there are people within compaq that are working
<BR>
to get it released, but since compaq owns patents on the technology, it is
<BR>
an uphill battle with the lawyers.  don't expect to see em86 sources any
<BR>
time soon.
