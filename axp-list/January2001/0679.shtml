<P><EM>&gt; OKay, so after much studying of SCSI arch. I came to the conclusion that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the problem was my SCSI controller which has two physical busses (68pin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and 50pin) shared on the same SCSI bus.  So, I went down the street and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; got a dual channel QLogic ISP board.  MILO supported it so I figured I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cool.  Come to find out - AlphaBIOS doesn't like it and I can't get SRM on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my box for the life of me.  I guess SRM doesn't like any of the video
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cards I have lying around.  Tried an ATI Rage IIc, and a Matrox Mystyque -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all I get is a blue screen with a flashing cursor in the upper left
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corner.  
</EM><BR>
<P>If you see the blue screen and the flashing cursor, that's good. That
<BR>
(usually) means that card made it through the x86 emulator. Chances are it's just
<BR>
set to serial console. Wait a minute or so and press enter several times,
<BR>
then do a:
<BR>
set console graphics
<BR>
<P>you should be in good shape after that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I have a FireGL 1000 at home which I will try tomorrow.  Anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have any idea how I can make this configuration work?
</EM><BR>
<P>That card should work as well.
