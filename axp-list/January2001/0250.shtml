<P>While all this is so very true, SteveCraft probably meant the
<BR>
&quot;non-contiguous files %&quot; that fsck reports. That number actually is the
<BR>
(internal) fragmentation, i.e. the percentage of files that have at least
<BR>
one jump in their sequence of blocks. As this number says nothing about
<BR>
how large these jumps are, it doesn't really tell how severe fragmentation
<BR>
is. Ext2fs tries to avoid jumps, and tries to keep them small if
<BR>
unavoidable.
<BR>
<P>This number therefore does not mean the same as the equivalent number a
<BR>
certain less refined OS from Redmond reports. In practice you shouldn't
<BR>
worry unless the percentage gets larger than 10 - 15%. You won't notice
<BR>
fragmentation effects when loading binaries (page by page) to memory in a
<BR>
multitasking, multiuser environment. You may notice the effects if you
<BR>
sequentially read large files, though.
<BR>
<P>Note that, when using the default 1k blocks, having 8192 blocks per group
<BR>
means that every file larger than 8 MB extends beyond one block group and
<BR>
will be non-contiguous according to fsck. At home, I have a backup
<BR>
partition containing large tar.gz's only. It's 100% fragmented ;-)
