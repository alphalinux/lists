Hi,
<BR>
<P>(please be kind: I am NO hacker by any means, just an admin with little AXP
<BR>
experience wondering if his AS200s are really slow)
<BR>
<P>I am (still;-) trying to set up a netfilter/iptables firewall on an AS200
<BR>
(233MHz, 128 MB) or (if it the AS200 doesn't cut it) a Ruffian (533 MHz,
<BR>
256MB). We have a 100MBit/s connection (honestly) to our ISP for internet
<BR>
traffic and web site production, so I'd rather have a firewall that is
<BR>
capable of routing at least 10 MBytes/sec with some headroom for filtering.
<BR>
The NICs I tested are
<BR>
<P>- Intel dual eepro100 (Dell OEM, pretty new)
<BR>
- Adaptec quad starfire (not so new)
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately I cannot get either of them running stable with a 2.4.0 kernel
<BR>
on Alpha, so I went back to 2.2.18 plus the latest netdrivers from
<BR>
www.scyld.com (Donald Becker). To measure the performance I have set up a
<BR>
server (Dual 1GHz-PIII, rh6.2 + kernel 2.2.18), dual eepro100 and 4 clients
<BR>
(Celeron 600, plain rh6.2).
<BR>
<P>I then measured the maximum the server and the clients can do with &quot;tbench
<BR>
4&quot;:
<BR>
<P>- server over lo: 40 MBytes/s
<BR>
- client over lo: 6 MBytes/s
<BR>
- 2 clients directly connected to a dedicated nic on the server: 10 MBytes/s
<BR>
each
<BR>
- 3 clients directly connected to server: &gt;8 MBytes/s each
<BR>
- 4 clients directly connected to server: ~7 MBytes/s each
<BR>
- i.e. the clients can saturate a 100MBit/s NIC and the server can saturate
<BR>
2 100 MBits/s NICs with hardly any trouble.
<BR>
- FWIW: all connections are switched over 3Com switches
<BR>
<P>Next I put an Alpha in the middle, connected two clients each to two ports
<BR>
and two server ports to the remaining two ports and set up routing
<BR>
accordingly. (I have an ISA VGA card in the AS200 to be able to use both PCI
<BR>
slots).
<BR>
<P>- 4 clients get ~5 MBytes/s each through the Ruffian. Excellent.
<BR>
- 4 clients get 0,8 MBytes/s each through the AS200. Not so good. (The
<BR>
switches do show that autonegotiation resulted in 100MBit/FD!)
<BR>
<P>vmstat on the Alpha shows ~25% sys load on the Ruffian and close to 100% sys
<BR>
load on the AS200 at ~6000 interrupts per second.
<BR>
<P>To me this means that the AS200 does max out here, most probably due to the
<BR>
high interrupt load.
<BR>
<P>My questions now:
<BR>
<P>- If I am totally wrong here: Which mailing list should I have posted this
<BR>
kind of question to? linux-alpha@vger? linux-kernel? Anywhere else I haven't
<BR>
come across yet?
<BR>
- Can anybody quote similar or better figures for the AS200? Or should I
<BR>
just ditch the 5 AS200s I have and use the Ruffians right away?
<BR>
- Would interrupt mitigation be able to help? I'd be willing to trade
<BR>
latency for throughput.
<BR>
- If so, how can I activate it in the drivers? I see a line &quot;static int
<BR>
interrupt_mitigation = 0x0;&quot; in starfire.c, but I cannot see that this
<BR>
variable is being used at all nor do I have any idea what to set it to and
<BR>
if this will work at all. I cannot find anything similar in eepro100.c.
<BR>
- Or should I rather play with &quot;max_interrupt_work = 20&quot; which both drivers
<BR>
offer as a module option?
<BR>
- Are there any kernel parameters I can play with?
<BR>
- Who and where should I report the trouble I am having with the quoted NICs
<BR>
and 2.4.0?
<BR>
<P>Thanks a lot for reading this much!
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
Ingo
<BR>
<P>P.S. And thanks a LOT to Rich and Michal who got me running with my Alphas
<BR>
in the beginning!
