<P>
I have tried uprgrading to Redhat Linux 7.0 as well, and have had problems
<BR>
with X with numerous cards. I have tried a Permidia and a DEC PBXGA-AA/An.
<BR>
On the DEC, I aonly got it working at 640x480. On the Permedia, for some
<BR>
reason, GNOME started but never finished loading. I don't know if this is a
<BR>
bug......
<BR>
I thunk I will stick with 6.1.

<EM>&gt; Er... The last time I looked RH 7 CD included both 4.0.1 and 3.3.6

<EM>&gt; X servers.  Not to mention such things like a compiler.

<EM>&gt; This does not make the bug less real, but was it reported?  Both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; XFree guys and <A HREF="http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/.">http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/.</A>
</EM><BR>
<P>I have also had problems with X since I upgraded (side-graded?)
<BR>
from RH6.1 to RH7.  A partial solution in my case was to
<BR>
install the version 3.3.6 XFree servers from source.  The
<BR>
source RPM is on the source CD, XFree86-Servers-3.3.6 or
<BR>
something close to that.  After doing an rpm --rebuild, the
<BR>
binary RPMs are stored in a path that shows up right at the
<BR>
end of the output from the rebuild.  Install all those
<BR>
binary RPMs, one per server type.  Then, do 'Xconfigurator
<BR>
--preferxf3' to use the XFree 3.3.6 servers.
<BR>
<P>I may have had hardware problems complicating the RH7 software
<BR>
issues.  I had a Voodoo3-3K in my UP2K system, and today the
<BR>
Voodoo died.  Even in the text console, _and_ in SRM console,
<BR>
every fourth scan line was blank, with its active pixels
<BR>
shifted up or down (I can't remember which) one line.  It
<BR>
looked kind-of strange.  I was fortunate I still had a Permedia
<BR>
card, but the RH7 X stuff (4 or 3.3.6) doesn't play well with
<BR>
that card, either.
<BR>
<P>Good luck with your system.
