<P>
Rich,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;EV69 soon, really? It's amazing what you learn on these lists :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Little birdy, could'a been fluffing though.  Concrete facts can be hard to
<BR>
come by, as I have found out the hard way.  There have been tales of EV68
<BR>
cores extended to EV68&quot;E&quot; which was supposed to include on-die L2 cache
<BR>
between 1.5-8MB (hard to believe the 8MB, but 1.5MB sounds like EV7). Even
<BR>
Terry Shannon has talked about this (privately anyway). Also, a new die
<BR>
shrink with a couple of fixes supposedly puts the EV69 at 1.0-1.2GHz, but
<BR>
this isn't supposed to be available until the end of the year, debuted with
<BR>
the new, hush-hush chipset to replace Tsunami/Typhoon. I'd be surprised if
<BR>
you were willing to confirm or deny any of this. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Aren't they doing an 833MHz 8MB DDR for the DS20E? At least I thought I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;saw a reference to that.
</EM><BR>
<P>I haven't seen anything for DS20E published, but they are amping up the
<BR>
ES40E. The Alphaserver report that was just sent today covered that upgrade.
<BR>
The old timeline for 21264 was that we would see 933MHz and 1GHz+ parts by
<BR>
now.  Is this a yield problem, a thermal problem or the limitation of the
<BR>
memory controller in the Tsunami/Typhoon chipset to keep up with these
<BR>
faster processors?  I can only hope that the new chipset supports 66MHz PCI,
<BR>
my oldest UltraSPARC (an Ultra 30) had support for 64 bit/66MHz PCI way back
<BR>
in 1997.  A lot of impressive new Fibrechannel/SCI/Gigabit Ethernet wares
<BR>
are starting to make good use of all that bandwidth.  PCIX support for
<BR>
GByte/ps slots would be even better (backward compatible) and jump over the
<BR>
competition. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Nope, they are actually quite different. All the Tsunami machines (DS20[E],
</EM><BR>
DS10[L], XP1000, UP2000[+], CS20, ES40 did I 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;miss any?) use the same kernel type in Linux - DP264.
</EM><BR>
<P>Having inspected the NT setup disk, I saw that both UP2000 and DP264 were
<BR>
using the same HAL (DP264). I didn't want to include the DS10/DS10L/ES40 or
<BR>
XP1000 since these are different markets and wouldn't be used in the same
<BR>
roles. I didn't even want to compare them, Tsunami based or not.  I don't
<BR>
think DS10/DS10L ever supported NT (at least publicly), I've never seen an
<BR>
AlphaBIOS for either of them.  
<BR>
