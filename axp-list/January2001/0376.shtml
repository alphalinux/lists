<P>
I've installed RH6.2 on mine. (haven't been daring enough to try 7.0 yet).
<BR>
<P>to change it to SRM, turn the power on and hold the HALT button in until it
<BR>
comes up in SRM. when it comes up, at the 'P00&gt;&gt;' prompt type in:
<BR>
'set os_type Unix'
<BR>
<P>the next time that you reboot it'll come up in SRM from now on.
<BR>
<P>There's only a few issues to watch for when you install on it.
<BR>
<P>-&gt;The onboard SCSI card is a 53c810 and shows up as the first controller in
<BR>
SRM. The only thing that's on it is the CDRom.
<BR>
<P>I'm not sure if the Advansys card works in AlphaLinux or is recognised by
<BR>
SRM. if it isn't recognised by SRM you can't boot off of it. My 5300 has an
<BR>
intraserver card w/ dual 53c875's and a tulip on it that is fully supported.
<BR>
<P>check and see if you have the 'stock' dual 875 based card in there too.
<BR>
<P><P>good luck,
<BR>
Kurt

Subject: Digital Server 5000 (Need some info on install)
<BR>
<P><P>Hi,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just gotten a Digital Server 5000. This is the one that was
<BR>
made for NT. I plan on running Linux on this box. I know there are some
<BR>
issues. The most I have been able to gather is that I would need to
<BR>
switch it to SRM(then reboot).
<BR>
<P>But, I would like to know if anyone can give me some detailed steps in
<BR>
getting Linux on this box.(I do have RedHat 7 Alpha cd's). Basically, a
<BR>
little walk trhough on hwo to change the SRM, then do I boot from floppy
<BR>
or cd, any issues with lilo(or is it milo on Alpha?).
<BR>
<P>My config:
<BR>
<P>Digital Server 5000
<BR>
400MHz 4mb cache 21164 cpu
<BR>
256mb ram
<BR>
3com 3c905b 10/100 PCI
<BR>
Integrated scsi on-board + Advansys PCI SCSI card(for external  use)
<BR>
Intergraph Computer Systems video card w/ Cirrus Logic chipset (Takes up
<BR>
two PCI slots)
<BR>
4gig hd in a drive sled
<BR>
<P><P>Thank you for all and any help.
<BR>
<P>Kyle
