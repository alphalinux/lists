<EM>&gt; Hm!  In theory you may be right.  In practice whenever I see &quot;Java&quot; I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expect troubles.  When some site has Java applets then it likely means
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that a browser will die and I do not even need Alpha for that.  Go to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.Colorado.EDU/physics/2000/atomic_lab.html">http://www.Colorado.EDU/physics/2000/atomic_lab.html</A> (I think that this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is _this_ URL; if not then some other on this &quot;physics/2000/&quot; site),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; walk through all &quot;experiments&quot; and tell me how you fared.  Using Windows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or lynx for that is cheating. :-) And you really have a full blown Java
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; runtime for Linux/Alpha?  Tell this to Uncle George, please.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you run netscape on alpha then you are already expecting the browser
<BR>
to die. That problem has nothing to do with Java. I do not have proof of
<BR>
this but my feeling is that the problem with Java is not in the Virtual
<BR>
Machine emulation but in the surronding libraries. There is a lot of
<BR>
code there that has been written quickly and I expect without a lot of
<BR>
care. Remember Sun was being driven to prodouce as much volume as
<BR>
possibly to insure Microsoft would not hijack the process.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I don't think anybody would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; suggest the you just recompile/rewrite Java applications because the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; will run faster in native C code.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Very frequently infinitely faster and that is where the fun begins... :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>I am not all that personaly enamored of Java. I feel that it is a half
<BR>
baked attempt to implement the ideas that I first saw embodied in a
<BR>
language called Turing.
