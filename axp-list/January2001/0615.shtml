<EM>&gt; This is the Alpha list. We, the Alpha users, are missing a lot of applications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that are solely available for Intel Linux. I'm for instance searching for a CAD
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; package.
</EM><BR>
<P>So port one.  Can't find any free CAD software?  Build it.  No time?  Buy it. 
<BR>
Can't buy it for Alpha?  Forget it.
<BR>
<P>Whenever you buy software priced for volume shipment (i.e. anything with fewer
<BR>
than six zeros), you are on the vendor's terms.  You buy the software on the
<BR>
platforms they support.
<BR>
<P>It sucks, but that's part of the reason free software is picking up steam: 
<BR>
Users want to do whatever they wish with the code.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Therfore wine cold be an option, but even wine is not able to run on Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux because it doesnt emulate the x86 code, it emulates the windows run-time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environment.
</EM><BR>
<P>FX!32 might be the best emulator ever, but it still sucks.  There's no
<BR>
substitute for native execution.
<BR>
<P>And don't forget that your commercial software vendor won't support you if you
<BR>
run an emulator.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; We are a lot of serious businesses, that are very willing to pay for good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; applications. We did not enter the Linux world because of the free software.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then why exactly do you use Linux?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; We see the problem as &quot;the hesitance of porting to Linux because the Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; community resists to pay for software&quot;. If a market doesn't provide a business,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there is no market.
</EM><BR>
<P>I see the problem as normal market tendencies.  Even Linux on Intel doesn't have
<BR>
critical mass.  Why do you think Quake for Linux was pulled from retail
<BR>
channels?
<BR>
<P>Of course, if Windows came with the full complement of software found on just
<BR>
about any Linux distribution, even that market wouldn't be nearly what it is
<BR>
today.  Imagine if Linux distributions came with a kernel, shell and window
<BR>
system, and everything else was &quot;sold separately&quot;.
