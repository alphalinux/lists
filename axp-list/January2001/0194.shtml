<P>
I'm trying to get Squeak (Smalltalk) to run on Alpha Linux, and
<BR>
it's doing some strange things, so I'm seeking suggestions.
<BR>
<P>------------
<BR>
<P>In one sandbox, I'm trying to build from sources.  After working
<BR>
around a few issues in the source, and after following Michal
<BR>
Jaegermann's excellent advice on how to get a &quot;ld&quot; that takes
<BR>
-taso (and how to recover from a big mistake), I have &quot;ld&quot;
<BR>
building a binary.  However, &quot;ld&quot; gives a warning:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ld: warning: cannot find entry symbol __start; defaulting to 0000000012013ae0
<BR>
<P>Then, when I try to run the binary, I get &quot;command not found&quot;
<BR>
errors.  The file exists and has the 'x' bit set.  However, even
<BR>
gdb refuses to run it.
<BR>
<P>What is this missing __start?  Any suggestions to make the binary
<BR>
actually run?
<BR>
<P>------------
<BR>
<P>In another sandbox, I'm trying to install the OSF binary, for
<BR>
alphaev56-dec-osf4.0e, and it almost works.  (I have the Tru64
<BR>
compatibility package.)  When I run the binary, the window comes
<BR>
up, but the fonts are mangled, and there seem to be off-by-one
<BR>
errors in pixel addressing (slivers left behind when moving
<BR>
windows, etc.).
<BR>
<P>I have a UP2000 (ev67).  Should this be able to run the ev56 OSF
<BR>
binary?  Any suggestions for fixing the font and pixel addressing
<BR>
issues?
<BR>
<P>------------
<BR>
<P>I may build a third sandbox, trying to run the X86-Linux binary
<BR>
under em86.  I imagine that will be fun.  :-)
<BR>
<P>Thanks.
