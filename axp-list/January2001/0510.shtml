<P>It is worth discussing so that people know all the issues involved,
<BR>
not just the sensationalist hipe posted on slashdot.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; gcc-2.96 is not suited for kernel, nor development work. The C++ APIs will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not be forward or backward compatible.
</EM><BR>
<P>And C++ ABIs (not APIs) have *nothing* to do with kernel development.
<BR>
Further, all Linux development recommendations require that C++
<BR>
applications link all C++ symbols statically (in both the LDPS (Linux
<BR>
Development Platform Specification) and soon to be in the LSB (Linux
<BR>
Standard Base) drafts by consensus of the LSB meeting in NYC on
<BR>
Tuesday).  C++ won't be covered until later.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It's a development snapshot.
</EM><BR>
<P>That has had considerable work done on it to make it stable.  In fact,
<BR>
GCC 3.0 will be in much better shape sooner because of the development
<BR>
during Red Hat Linux 7.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The GCC people and the linux kernel development people have both come out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strongly against RH shipping 7.0 with gcc-2.96 ...
</EM><BR>
<P>The GCC people were upset about the naming.  Linus followed up saying
<BR>
that while he wasn't happy about it appearing in a major distribution,
<BR>
the GCC snapshot may well produce the best code of any other released
<BR>
GCC.  In fact, he encouraged people to give it a try, but to qualify
<BR>
bug reports with gcc version (which is good practice anyway.)  I can
<BR>
dig up his post if you would like to see it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've had about 1 in 4 luck compiling things with it, and out of that, a 1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in 4 of them running.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've put your email address in the &quot;Reporter&quot; field of the bugzilla
<BR>
query page and got zero (0) matches.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The good news is that gcc-3.0 has entered a feature freeze, where they're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just concentrating on bug fixes for it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which is what we've been doing for our compiler snapshot for months.
<BR>
In fact, almost every bug we've fixed needed to be applied to CVS HEAD
<BR>
GCC (which we do, along with the appropriate regression test cases for
<BR>
the test suite)
<BR>
<P>In short, we are dedicated to providing support for this compiler.  It
<BR>
bootstraps the entire distribution (except the kernel, for the kernel
<BR>
makefile and inline assumptions in 2.2.x, and qt 1.2 apps as we wanted
<BR>
to keep the ancient egcs 1.1.2 ABI for them).  This is no small feat.
<BR>
<P>I won't promise that there are no bugs, but people who say that it is
<BR>
broken without reporting any do no good for either 2.96 or 3.0
<BR>
development.
<BR>
<P>Reporting a bug against the 2.96 snapshot in Red Hat Linux 7 will be a
<BR>
sure-fire way to make sure that it is fixed in 3.0 as well.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
<P>Matt
