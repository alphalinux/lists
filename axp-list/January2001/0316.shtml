The problem was that mkdosfs wasn't installed and I couldn't find one for the
<BR>
alpha on RedHat. I then searched for generic source code to mkfs to see if I
<BR>
could compile one on the alpha that would then be able to create a
<BR>
FAT filesystem. No luck, so I gave up and since no response from this list
<BR>
appeared, I have since just used the milo floppy.
<BR>
<P>I will have to check if I can find a submenu on ARC (when I get home) that will
<BR>
create a FAT FS.
<BR>
<P>When I installed RH (5.2, 6.0 and 6.2) I thought I was very careful about
<BR>
selecting stuff that should have included mkdosfs, but I could of course be
<BR>
wrong. Would you happen to know what package it would be in, in any of these
<BR>
RedHat distributions? When doing 'man mkdosfs' I don't recall that it told me
<BR>
anything useful, or if it even was there.
<BR>
<P>Thank you very much for responding,
<BR>

<EM>&gt; what you have done or not done - and this includes typing 'man mkdosfs'.

<EM>&gt; The last time I was running mkdosfs on Alpha it worked exactly as

<EM>&gt; Besides most versions of ARC, and similar, have somewhere (usually well

<EM>&gt; hidden under five layers, or so, of submenus) a menu entry for laying

<EM>&gt; out a FAT file system on a chosen partition.  For ARC this has to be
