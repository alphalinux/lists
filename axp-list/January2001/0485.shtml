<P><EM>    Ron&gt; Ok, I took out the ESS SOLO1 PCI sound card from my ruffian
</EM><BR>
<EM>    Ron&gt; and put in a AWE64. Sound cards are not my cup of tea, so of
</EM><BR>
<EM>    Ron&gt; course I can't seem to get it to work. Could someone who has
</EM><BR>
<EM>    Ron&gt; one working in an Alpha send me their kernel '.config' and
</EM><BR>
<EM>    Ron&gt; '/etc/isapnp.conf' files?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>    Ron&gt; TIA, Ron
</EM><BR>
<P>This works on my lx164 linux 2.2.18.
