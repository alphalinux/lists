<EM>&gt; You want the compiler written in Java?  Interesting idea.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I would like to see some serious, really useful, code
<BR>
written in Java and performing in a decent manner.  Not necessarily
<BR>
compiler.  I only said that gcj cannot serve as a shining example
<BR>
of a Java code as it is nothing of that kind.
<BR>
<P>I do not negate that some interesting stuff did show up in Java,
<BR>
although Boehm garbage collector was available for Objective-C,
<BR>
and succesfully used, long before Java showed up.  Also Perl, Python
<BR>
and Ruby manage memory pretty well - thank you very much.
<BR>
I was quite interested in Java at the very beginng, and even bought
<BR>
some books about it, :-) but I am still waiting for Java to come
<BR>
close to its promisses, and waiting, and waiting ...
<BR>
<P>As for Objective-C then at least the whole NeXTSTEP interface was
<BR>
written in it.  Not a huge commercial success but quite sizeable
<BR>
chunk of a real code which mostly worked as advertised.
