<EM>&gt;  &gt;We're wating to see how Jobs deals with the 1ghz barrier that Motorola
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;has slammed into... maybe at the Developer Conference coming up.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  True Bill, and with IBM fabbing Alpha CPUs now, it doesn't hurt.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  But then Alpha seems to have bloodied it's nose on that same barrier..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  If I look at the various documents (mainly Powerpoint slides) of DEC, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Compaq, and Samsung/API conferences and releases of 4 years ago until last 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  year, I see a common thread in that we should already be running EV7, newer 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Alpha chipsets, and well over 1GHz.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Yeah, I guess... sort of.
<BR>
<P>Hmmm... had to go dig out some files.
<BR>
<P>Compaq is now (as of 14 Feb) shipping the EV68 - 883mhz, and the 1.1 Ghz
<BR>
EV7 is expected to ship in May (which May depends upon the meaning of the
<BR>
word &quot;next&quot;) [Hey, if you can't believe the Register, who can you
<BR>
believe?] and Apple's ADC is in May...
<BR>
<P>So depending upon the way I read the graphs, 1.1 ghz EV7 was due on the
<BR>
last day of 2000... but then those graphs I have all refer to first
<BR>
tape-out, not shipping-to-end-customer production.  
<BR>
<P>Also, when mine were done, IBM wasn't in the picture, they were strictly
<BR>
the initial Samsung projections. And according to Shannon (SKC), IBM is now
<BR>
clocking the EV68 at 1.1 GHZ - faster than Samsung's EV7! 
<BR>
<P>My guess is that the pressure on EV7 is from Tandem, not High-Performance
<BR>
Computing. And that IS an interesting implication.
<BR>
<P>Call it wishful thinking, but Apple sized production volumes would do
<BR>
wonders for the cost of the Alpha Chip! It would be kind of ironic if the
<BR>
first EV7 chips were to be available in your Titanium.
<BR>
