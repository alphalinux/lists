<P>
Thanks to some advice from posters to this list, I have ported some
<BR>
computationally intensive Fortran code to my alpha Linux system (XP-1000,
<BR>
RH7.0).  While the code gives correct output, my recent benchmarks indicate
<BR>
a substantial difference in the code's performance on alpha Linux vs. Tru64
<BR>
systems with nearly identical hardware (both using the same optimization
<BR>
flags with Compaq compilers).  I would like to profile the code using
<BR>
gprof or iprobe, but neither of these seems to work:
<BR>
<P>Gprof: I can compile the code with -pg, and a gmon.out is produced,
<BR>
but the subsequent execution of &quot;gprof &lt;binary&gt;&quot; gives the error: gprof:
<BR>
gmon.out file is missing call-graph data.  I know from my perusal of the
<BR>
archives at alphalinux.org that gprof has had serious problems in the past,
<BR>
but most of the discussion appears to be out-of-date.
<BR>
<P>Iprobe: The RPMs available at the Compaq site are geared to RH6.0.  When I
<BR>
run the iprobe binary, it fails and reports an ioctl error.  I also tried
<BR>
to compile the source myself, but there are numerous header errors and
<BR>
incompatibilities to current Linux distributions.  From past discussion of
<BR>
iprobe on this list, it seems to be the method of choice, if only I could
<BR>
get it to work.
<BR>
<P>If anyone has dealt with these problems and had more success than I, I
<BR>
would appreciate your input.
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
<P>-Daniel
<BR>
<P>P.S. Can anyone explain the current state of system time accounting on
<BR>
alpha systems?  Part of my problem involves very large system times
<BR>
relative to reasonable user times, and the elapsed time is pretty darned
<BR>
close to the sum of the two, with nearly 99% utilization.  This is rather
<BR>
confusing.
