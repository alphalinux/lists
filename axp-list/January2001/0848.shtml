<P>
Strange, I hope others have run into this and found a fix already though
<BR>
I have not found any reference in the mailinglist archives. My old LX
<BR>
running 6.2 was upgraded to 7.0. Now Xfree-4.0 does not work. even the
<BR>
DRI build I used when I ran 6.2 doesnt work, even after I rebuilt it.
<BR>
What happens is X starts and comes up all the way but then my keyboard
<BR>
and mouse go dead. I can't shutdown the system gracefully and have to
<BR>
clunk it. Anyone else run into this?
<BR>
<P>I also tried installing RH-7.0 fresh on a spare HD (what I should have
<BR>
done to begin with) and I see the same problems with X 4.0. X 3.3.6
<BR>
starts but its kinda broken. I.e when I move windows they aren't
<BR>
redrawn... The video card is a voodoo 3000 PCI and i'm running SRM
<BR>
5.8-1. 
<BR>
<P>TIA
