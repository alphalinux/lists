Hey Kirk...
<BR>
<P>If you partitioned your drive to emulate TRU64 ( e.g. partition 3 spans the
<BR>
entire disk ), You need to specify -f3 on your swriteboot.
<BR>
<P>HTH...

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Michal,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;This &quot;automatic&quot; stuff I did not try.  I always had something else
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;on a test machine which I was not going to risk.  But - /boot does 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;not have to be a separate partition.  It might be but this is not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;a requirement.  Maybe you are mixing things with a small FAT partition 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;which is holding bits and pieces for milo?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm using SRM 5.8.1, not AlphaBIOS, so no FAT SYSTEM partition.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; completely blew away the partition table and rebooted before making a new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attempt at installing and partitioning (good general practice across all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; platforms). 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  - 'anaconda' is very cautious when writing a boot block.  Probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    a tad overcautious but this is better then a possiblitiy of loosing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    your data.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Any schmuck who doesn't backup before doing upgrades and rebuilds deserves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to lose partitions (I speak from experience). : )
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  - It is quite trivial to write that bootloader _after_ the whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    installation if you are really sure that there is a space for it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I used SWRITEBOOT repeatedly, but apparently the partition was hosed and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; refused to write anything.  Rebuild using the above mentioned procedure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; followed time and time again.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;It did not leave space or a bootloader was not automatically written?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;These are two different things.  Frankly I do not know what Disk Druid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;will do when it will find an already existing partition table.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No partition tables were present, I NUKED 'EM and rebooted.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If you have a separate /boot then 'aboot.conf' file will have to live on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;this partition as well.  Minor, but worth to remember.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Checked and confirmed repeatedly, eventually I knew every bit of syntax
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; option. I can rewrite the whole file in my sleep.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;From your description it looks like that you were possibly at the very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;end save a small step.  Hard to be sure.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's what I thought.  Just an exercise in learning the more intimate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; details of BSD partitioning.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Did you file a detailed report on <A HREF="http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla?">http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla?</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; At the time, I didn't know if that would do any good.  Reporting bugs had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; always been something of a one-sided affair in the bygone days of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha/NT.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have yet to get one useful bit of technical support (at $250.00 per
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hour)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from MS tech support. By the time I run out of ideas, KNOW ONE seems to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know, at least on NT.  Self-support with a major price tag.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Is not a bad policy but I am a bit confused.  In one place you said that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Disk Druid was from RH 7 and in the other that this was 9 month ago.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;That Disk Druid was not available at that time.  Maybe I misunderstood
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;something?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You'd be right on that, no Disk Druid yet. I did an &quot;automatic&quot; with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; workstation configuration trashing everything on disk (if there was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything, usually not) and building a 10MB /boot, a 16MB /SWAP and a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; variable / filling up the disk. I was highly reluctant to use FDISK to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the work myself. I only created /boot as a separate partition because I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wanted to follow OSF/1 conventions I learned from my first Digital UNIX
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; class and of course ARC conventions (NT) which dictate a small bootstrap
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; partition as part of the spec.  Both are &quot;optional&quot; because you can easily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; install the bootstrap program onto the same partition as the OS install,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with some restrictions and some loss of flexibility.  NT would have to run
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in a FAT portion, Digital UNIX would have to share the same UFS.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;An output of 'fdisk -l' _may_ clear up something or maybe you do have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;problems with reading your disks.  It is hard to guess.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; FDISK -L did what again? I would just wipe, write the cleaned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; partition-free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; config, quit, reboot and start all over.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If you are using 'fdisk' then make sure that this is rather new version.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;There were miscounting problems with fdisk on BSD type partitioning in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the past.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I used whatever 5.2, 6.0 and 7.0 ship with. I didn't even go hunt down the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; latest aboot (even though the latest is still technical beta).  I was not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yet in the know.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;You definitely do not have to switch between the two.  The whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;installation can be done with one or another and definitely with fdisk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;only (there was a lot of Alphas running Linux before Disk Druid showed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;up on a scene :-).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What is the best method for setting the mount point from FDISK? I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attempted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to determine this from the installation guide, but this was not very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; helpful.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks,
</EM><BR>
