<P>
The idea of running a binary for a foreign architecture on a system is
<BR>
not not new and is in use all over the place.
<BR>
SCO and Linux support old xenix binaries.
<BR>
Java runs in a virtual machine.
<BR>
<P>In the case of the x86 there is a built in emulator so there a
<BR>
reasonable level of performance.
<BR>
<P>Java is targeted to a psudocode machine. nobody seems to have a problem
<BR>
with emulating the java virtual machine. I don't think anybody would
<BR>
suggest the you just recompile/rewrite Java applications because the
<BR>
will run faster in native C code.
<BR>
<P>There are 2 general approaches to solving the problem of how to run a
<BR>
binary on a foreign system.  Hardware emulation or recompilation.
<BR>
<P>Hardware emulation is in some ways the easiest and most reliable but
<BR>
suffers greatly from performance issues. The X86 strange register
<BR>
configuration and instruction set are difficult to emulate in a 64 bit
<BR>
RISC CPU. Well at least efficiently.
<BR>
<P>Recompilation can be far more efficient since there is an opportunity to
<BR>
evaluate the code and to optimize it so that it does not require a full
<BR>
register emulation of the original hardware. This is a far from trivial
<BR>
task and can in some cases become impossible if you have self modifying
<BR>
code.
<BR>
About 20 years ago I was involved in a research project to evaluate the
<BR>
possibility of recompiling 8086 code to run on a mainframe class
<BR>
computer system.
<BR>
In other areas work appears to be underway to recompile java binaries so
<BR>
that they can run natively instead of having to blindly run an
<BR>
instruction code interpreter.
<BR>
<P>There are some systems that will do a combination of interpretation and
<BR>
recompilation or incremental compilation. Transmeta's new CPU seems to
<BR>
be one of these along with a number of Java runtimes.
<BR>
<P>FX!32 from what I have read is more of a recompilation system using this
<BR>
technology it should be possible to take an x86 binary and convert it
<BR>
into a binary that will run natively on the Alpha.
<BR>
<P>It would be interesting to see if we can beat up on Compaq to release
<BR>
the FX!32 core technology into the Linux community. It would be
<BR>
interesting to take the FX!32 core software and build a wine like
<BR>
windows converter and being able to recompile X86 linux binaries would
<BR>
be useful.
