<EM>&gt; i dont know anything definitive, but i've heard a rumour that intel was so

<EM>&gt; that's not official though :)

My guess is something akin to this (again, not official).  See, you're
<BR>
supposing things were that overtly obvious - I'd be willing to bet that
<BR>
Intel couldn't (or wouldn't(?)) fab parts at the quality that DEC wanted
<BR>
at the time (I wasn't here then, so I wouldn't know), so it was just
<BR>
easier to have them keep making other, &quot;easier&quot; chips and find someone
<BR>
else.  I this case, the someone else was Samsung and then IBM.
<BR>
<P>Some of this makes sense when you also consider the billions of dollars
<BR>
Intel is pouring into Hudson now to &quot;modernize&quot; it.  Sounds like they
<BR>
really managed to screw up what I understand was a pretty nice plant at
<BR>
the time.  But again, as with all things at this level, I have no clue
<BR>
what really happened.  Boy, I'd have loved to be a fly on the wall for
<BR>
some of the meetings tho'... ;)
