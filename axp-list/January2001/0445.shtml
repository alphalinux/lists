<EM>&gt; &gt; What is &quot;the new ldmilo&quot;?  Dates and sizes?  The one I used looked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; like this &quot;18944 Nov 18  1998 ldmilo.exe&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That may be a different one though it's the same file size. Where did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you get it from?
</EM><BR>
<P>Most likely from <A HREF="ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/Milo">ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/Milo</A>
<BR>
but this was years ago so I do not remember.  If the size is the
<BR>
same then 'ldmilo' is probably also the same.  The date may got
<BR>
reset in some moment.  'md5sum' gives b7147b6a28d6e2005e2a9eca2f06f508
<BR>
on it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The milos and ldmilo from RH5.1 work fine with that and earlier
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distributions but for some reason (something to do with the size of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the kernel) won't install RH6.2 and later.
</EM><BR>
<P>I thought that I have seen quite a few things on Alphas but maybe
<BR>
not enough. :-)   Something does not compute here, in my experience.
<BR>
<P>If what you are saying is correct then use any kernel you can load to
<BR>
install any distribution you want and later make yourself a custom
<BR>
kernel, small enough, to work with your loader.  Replacing a kernel on a
<BR>
boot floppy is quite simple operation if you have an access to any
<BR>
machine which can write on floppies with ext2 file system.  Even some
<BR>
'Windows' boxes, with proper utilities installed, fit the bill.
<BR>
<P>Besides is it quite likely that with 5.x root/boot pair of floppies you
<BR>
can install any 6.x distro (not RH 7, though, as 'rpm' has different
<BR>
underlying formats).  I was installing &quot;wrong&quot; versions that way
<BR>
although I do not remember now exactly which particular ones.
