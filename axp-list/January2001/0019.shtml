<P>
<EM>&gt;It seems that we have a similar setup for installing RedHat Alpha on Multias. I do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;use Slackware on my x86, though :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>i was using openbsd a week ago, ill probably go back ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Anyhow, the way I was able to net-install RH (5.2, 6.0 and 6.2) on the Multia was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;through using the x86 machine with an apache server pointing to the CDROM with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;RedHat on. When attempting to use ftp I always got the error you describe, but at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;least in 5.2 and 6.0 it was also related to a bad tulip driver when using the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;10Base2 port (BNC). Now I finally got an inverted cable to use on the 10BaseT port
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(RJ45) so I don't know if it is still the case for 6.2 (a transmitter on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;AUI port, converting to BNC was what I used then).
</EM><BR>
<P>my http install was done with a working apache install, everything was checked and
<BR>
rechecked, and i got the error a few times.  i tried it with 10baseT through a switch,
<BR>
havent tried bnc yet, didnt think itd make a difference.  the problem seems to have
<BR>
happened no matter how i try the install.  http through the lan, ftp through the lan,
<BR>
cdrom through a scsi cable, and ftp install through sunsite.ualberta.ca, as well as
<BR>
two others.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;And finally, do you know that during the RedHat installation you can switch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;virtual terminals (F1 through F4 I believe) and from there see better information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about what is going on during the installation. That will help you debug your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;installproblems.
</EM><BR>
<P>you know, i knew this, but i forgot to look.  im gonna try to botch the install again
<BR>
and look for output....
<BR>
<P>thanks,
<BR>

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, you should make sure that the httpd server (apache?) is actually working and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; providing access to the CDROM where you expect it. This might seem as an insult to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you, but something I at some times didn't check when I should have and it didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually work (having only one monitor and switching back and forth helps with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; confusion:-)
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't know if any of this was news, but those were what came to my mind when I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; read your email.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Have fun,
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt; &gt; hey there, im trying to get redhat 6.2 running on my multia.  this is a basic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; multia setup, but its all basically never used hardware (ruling out the heat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; death).  ive got an external scsi hard drive/cdrom that im trying to install
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to/with.  here is my problem:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; everything boots fine, but the install program dies with the error &quot;unable to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; load second stage ramdisk&quot;.  ive tried the install via cdrom (many many times),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; local image, http, and ftp from 4 different sources.  this is unbeleivably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; discouraging, and i am very new to the alpha architecture, so it is likely that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; im doing something wrong, i just dont know what.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; hopefully someone has had this problem and knows a solution, as i have tried
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; everything that makes sense to me.  any help would be very appreciated.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thanks,
