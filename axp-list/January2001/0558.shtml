<EM>&gt;   Hi
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   I have a bunch of XP1000s, each with two 9gig Compaq drives on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   standard QLogic isp1020 scsi controller. They are mostly running Redhat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   6.0 with a 2.2.13 kernel, though one now has RH7.0 with kernel 2.2.17.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   On all these machines hdparm -t is showing about 15 mb/sec disk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   transfer rates, which is probably about right for these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   disks. However, I recently added software raid (0, striping two 6 gig
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   partitions) to the RH7.0 version and much to my surprise, hdparm -t on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   the md0 device gave me 15 mb/sec!!!. I have verified the transfer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   rate using dd and I believe it is real.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Don,
<BR>
<P>I have encountered exactly the same poor I/O performance on my XP-1000s.
<BR>
I am dismayed by this, because my calculations are very I/O intensive.
<BR>
I haven't solved the problem yet, but I am pursuing options.  My current
<BR>
answers to your questions:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    1) what sort of disk performance should I expect with the standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       xp1000 hardware?
</EM><BR>
<P>The QL ISP1020 is an Ultra Wide SCSI adapter, which means you can get a
<BR>
maximum transfer rate of 40 MB/s.  The disks Compaq shipped with my XP-1000
<BR>
are all Ultra3 SCSI, which have a max. rate of 160 MB/s.  This fabulous
<BR>
rate doesn't matter, though, because the controller is totally incapable
<BR>
of handling it.  It doesn't matter if you use raid0, because the hardware
<BR>
is inadequate.  Also, it has been suggested that, because the SCSI
<BR>
controller is built into the motherboard on the XP-1000, this can actually
<BR>
degrade performance --- I do not know if this is true at all, though, so
<BR>
I'm just passing along a rumor here.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    2) is the current performance limited by the isp1020 or the driver
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       software?
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe the problem is *mostly* hardware.  I've tried the same I/O tests
<BR>
on a Tru64 XP-1000 with the same SCSI hardware and obtained the same
<BR>
results.  However, when you jump to better hardware, it is possible that
<BR>
the Linux ext2 filesystem may become a limiting factor.  I plan to try the
<BR>
SGI XFS in the next couple of days to test this theory.  I have not noticed
<BR>
substantial differences among 2.2.14, 2.2.17, 2.2.18 or 2.4.0.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    3) is there a recommended &quot;good&quot; controller to add to the system to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       improve the disk storage performance (one I could boot from via
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       SRM)?
</EM><BR>
<P>I've just ordered an Ultra2 SCSI controller from my Compaq rep to test
<BR>
these I/O problems.  Compaq is not currently selling Ultra3 controllers for
<BR>
the XP-1000 (which I don't quite understand, since they'll sell the Ultra3
<BR>
disks).
<BR>
<P>Let me know if you learn anything.
<BR>
<P>-Daniel
