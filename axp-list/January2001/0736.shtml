<P>Putting my name in the subject is a good way to get my attention,
<BR>
IF the message gets sorted into a bucket that I look at.  A better
<BR>
way is to just send it to Tom.Morris@api-networks.com.  Then
<BR>
I'll be sure to look at it.

<P><EM>&gt; Same Tsunami chipset? Where are the newer systems based on the Caspian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chipset?  Are these still under development?  My understanding was that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these would incorporate a faster memory channel, support 66MHz PCI and new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DDR SDRAM on the EV68 and EV69E processors (at least according to the ol'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Register).

<P>I think Rich Payne answered all the CS20 aspects of this question.  As
<BR>
far as futures go, far be it from me to contradict The One True Source
<BR>
(aka the register).  Without delving too far into the boring technical
<BR>
details,
<BR>
suffice it to say that the fact a new generation (CS20) is commercially
<BR>
available
<BR>
now, means that the next generation is well along in development.  As is
<BR>
traditional, it will have the usual assortment of &quot;ers&quot;  (e.g. better,
<BR>
faster, 
<BR>
prettier), while at the same time retaining the traditional Alpha &quot;ests&quot;
<BR>
(fastest, baddest, hottest, ...)
<BR>
<P>Tom
<BR>
<P>P.S.  For anyone else who just received the message that KirkE is
<BR>
responding to, please ignore my invitation to stop by the booth.
