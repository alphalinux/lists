</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   From: alvin &lt;alvin@Iplink.net&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   The idea of running a binary for a foreign architecture on a system is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   not not new and is in use all over the place.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   SCO and Linux support old xenix binaries.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Java runs in a virtual machine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Don't forget Apple and the PowerPC vs 68K.
<BR>
<P>Then there was some outfit in Blue that was emulating the living daylights
<BR>
out of things on something called an SP2.
<BR>
<P>I've been pushing the prediction that by about 2003-2005, we are going to
<BR>
see the &quot;end&quot; of the &quot;midrange&quot; computer... boxes that TODAY cost around
<BR>
$100 or $200K and look like EV7 based machines. Those EV7 class machines
<BR>
will be &quot;shrunk&quot; to under $10K and have EV9 performace... and we're going
<BR>
to call them &quot;appliances.&quot; Supporting those boxes (ie as aplication
<BR>
servers, etc) will be Wildefire class machines... priced down to the $250K
<BR>
level.
<BR>
<P>Once you get &quot;real&quot; performance down to the silicon level, &quot;emulation&quot;
<BR>
becomes a much more intellegent solution.
<BR>
<P>Then there is the thing called Transmeta.... it emulates everything and
<BR>
supposedly everything.
<BR>
<P>The technologies and capabilities of emulation have changed pretty
<BR>
radically in recent years and I would expect them to continue changing at
<BR>
much the same pace.
<BR>
<P>A few years back Soft-PC ran on DEC. But Soft-PC only ever ran a pretended
<BR>
version of Windows... Unlike Connectix Virtual PC which emulates the X86
<BR>
and can run Windows/NT and Linux on top of the Mac OS. (And remember,
<BR>
Connectix also has the Virtual Game Station.)
<BR>
<P>Now if the Mac OS ran on Alpha.... but then something called OSX (aka
<BR>
Darwin) DOES... and, I've been told by reasonably reliable rumor mongers,
<BR>
that OSX AND Mac OS 9.1 are up and running on ALPHAs in Cupertino. Hmmm...
<BR>
<P>So maybe we should see about geting Connectix to port to Alpha. (If they
<BR>
haven't already done so.)
<BR>
<P>We're wating to see how Jobs deals with the 1ghz barrier that Motorola
<BR>
has slammed into... maybe at the Developer Conference coming up.
<BR>
