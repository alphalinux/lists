<P>This &quot;automatic&quot; stuff I did not try.  I always had something else

on a test machine which I was not going to risk.  But

&nbsp;&nbsp;- /boot does not have to be a separate partition.  It might be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is not a requirement.  Maybe you are mixing things with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a small FAT partition which is holding bits and pieces for milo?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- 'anaconda' is very cautious when writing a boot block.  Probably
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a tad overcautious but this is better then a possiblitiy of loosing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your data.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- It is quite trivial to write that bootloader _after_ the whole
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;installation if you are really sure that there is a space for it.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, indeed, for the first time you cannot boot from a hard disk
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but you have to do that from a CD or floppy.  Shrug!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I then performed a manual install using Disk Druid, created a 20MB /boot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (sda1) a 256MB /SWAP (sda2) and a 8548MB / (sda3). Disk Druid supposedly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; knows not to use the first cylinder for the first partition to avoid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; overwriting the SRM bootstrap (or preventing it from being written), but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When I completed with the installation and rebooted, I found that it had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; once again failed.
</EM><BR>
<P>It did not leave space or a bootloader was not automatically written?
<BR>
These are two different things.  Frankly I do not know what Disk Druid
<BR>
will do when it will find an already existing partition table.
<BR>
<P>If you have a separate /boot then 'aboot.conf' file will have to live on
<BR>
this partition as well.  Minor, but worth to remember.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I performed an identical install in TEXT mode but did not get any further.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;From your description it looks like that you were possibly at the very
</EM><BR>
end save a small step.  Hard to be sure.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The GUI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had formatted the partitions as instructed but something was still obviously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very wrong.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe a partition table was just not re-read properly?  A reboot
<BR>
and restart of an installation would have clear that one.
<BR>
<P>Did you file a detailed report on <A HREF="http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla?">http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla?</A>
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I rebooted the system, restarted the installation and used Disk Druid to set
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the mount points on my partitions.
</EM><BR>
<P>Is not a bad policy but I am a bit confused.  In one place you said that
<BR>
Disk Druid was from RH 7 and in the other that this was 9 month ago.
<BR>
That Disk Druid was not available at that time.  Maybe I misunderstood
<BR>
something?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; the &quot;automatic&quot; installations and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;manual&quot; installations always failed or the /boot partition could not be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; read properly and the swriteboot command never issued to write the boot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; block and Aboot bootstrap program.
</EM><BR>
<P>An output of 'fdisk -l' _may_ clear up something or maybe you do have
<BR>
problems with reading your disks.  It is hard to guess.
<BR>
<P>If you are using 'fdisk' then make sure that this is rather new version.
<BR>
There were miscounting problems with fdisk on BSD type partitioning in
<BR>
the past.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Having to switch from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; FDISK to Disk Druid to cover both parts of the install seems excessively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complex.
</EM><BR>
<P>You definitely do not have to switch between the two.  The whole
<BR>
installation can be done with one or another and definitely with fdisk
<BR>
only (there was a lot of Alphas running Linux before Disk Druid showed
<BR>
up on a scene :-).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The Red Hat/Mandrake/SuSe installation instructions were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extremely sparse in this regard.
</EM><BR>
<P>As far as Red Hat is involved then you have bugzilla.  See above.
