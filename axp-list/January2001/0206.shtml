I was a bit premature.... While after I rebuilt the ftp client I could xfer
<BR>
data Linux to Linux and Unix to Linux (all possible combinations of the two)
<BR>
I found this morning my Windows95 system got the &quot;unable to create data
<BR>
connection&quot; errors when connecting to my RH7.0 Linux/alpha server....
<BR>
(wu-ftpd-2.6.1), there is no passive command in the w95 ftp client.   I got
<BR>
a wu-ftpd-2.6.0-14.6x src kit, --recompiled and installed it,
<BR>
Every thing is working again......
<BR>
<P>commands used to build/install
<BR>
rpm --recompile wu-ftpd-2.6.0-14.6x.src.rpm
<BR>
rpm --erase --nodeps wu-ftpd
<BR>
rpm -Uvh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/alpha/wu-ftpd-2.6.0-14.6x.alpha.rpm

<P><P>recompiling and installing the ftp client from &quot;src&quot; eliminated my problem.
<BR>
<P>I copied ftp-0.17-6.src.rpm from the RH7.0 source CD. Then rebuilt the kit
<BR>
using:
<BR>
rpm --recompile ftp-0.17-6.src.rpm
<BR>
<P>Removed the old rpm
<BR>
rpm --erase ftp
<BR>
<P>Installed from the new kit
<BR>
rpm -Uvh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/alpha/ftp-0.17-6.alpha.rpm
<BR>
<P><PRE>

I can now ftp to RH7.0 alpha servers without the socket errors.
<P>A interesting note is this build from the source, does not default to
passive mode. So, what was used to build the rpm that's in RH7.0????

<P><P>More.
	I turned on debugging (-d) and now the following message shows up in
the /var/log/messages  file on the RH7.0 xp1000
<P>ftpd[13051]: getpeername /usr/sbin/in.ftpd : Socket operation on non-socket

<P><P>Ok,
	I have a PWS 433a which was running RH6.2 and running as a
workstation and, a xp1000 running RH6.2 setup as a server, I frequently use
FTP to transfer files between these two systems and a 4.0F Unix system and
have had no problems.    The xp1000 is setup as an FTP server, the PWS433 is
only a client.
<P>	The other day I upgraded both systems to RH7.0, and immediately ran
into the new &quot;passive&quot; mode default setting, If I connect to the Unix 4.0F
systems from the 433a using ftp and try to copy an image I get a &quot;entering
passive mode, connection refused&quot; message, If I then do a  &quot;pass off&quot;
everything work ok which is what I expect...
<P>	However, if I connect to the xp1000, from the 433a, I get the same
message, If I then enter the command &quot;pass off&quot;  I then get a &quot;cannot build
data connection&quot; which is a different error. There is nothing in the logs,
has anyone seen this?  Server Version is   wu-ftpd 2.6.1(1)
