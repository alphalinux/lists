<P>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my scsi cdrom drive apparently doesnt like cd-r media.
</EM><BR>
<P>It looks that way.  This is not unheard of although scsi is not
<BR>
a factor here. :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; im actually using redhat 6.2, which may be part of the problem.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not likely but did you check updates?  Boot images in particular?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; last night i seemed to read a few fairly nasty things about the redhat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 6.x series on alpha, they all seem to have suggested the best redhat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for alpha is 5.2.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are folks, usually without a trace of a clue, which will say
<BR>
nasty things about mostly anything.  Actually 5.2 is obsolete and
<BR>
6.2 + updates is very solid on Alpha. 6.0 was a junk but this is
<BR>
a different story.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; on top of that, redhat seems to be fine with seeing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scsi hard drive, so it really should be able to dump the entire cd 10
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or 11 times onto the thing if it needed.
</EM><BR>
<P>If it can read that.  This seems to be a problem.  There are drives
<BR>
really sensitive to media and I have seen batches of CD-R media which
<BR>
were simply bad.  We (i.e. Hard Data) write quite a bit of that stuff
<BR>
so I know the trouble first hand. :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; i had noticed a few odd errors while booting any sort of floppy on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; multia.  last night i also read that the flimsy little floppy cable on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these machines tends to produce a lot of noise.
</EM><BR>
<P>Possible.  I did a number of installs on multias but this was a long
<BR>
time ago.  I expect that their hardware does not improve with age.
<BR>
They run pretty hot inside of this small case.  A heat corrosion on
<BR>
a connector providing a power to mobo was quite popular incident.
