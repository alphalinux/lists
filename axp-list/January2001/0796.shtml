On Mon, Feb 26, 2001 at 08:02:05PM +0000, Ricardo M. Oliveira came forth with:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 	I am as unlucky... however I have a problem that I believe can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; help us both boot this thing.. as soon as I overcome it...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	I downloaded the image from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	<A HREF="http://www.freiburg.linux.de/~stepan/Milo/binaries/2.2-17/">http://www.freiburg.linux.de/~stepan/Milo/binaries/2.2-17/</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	but I can't seem to get it on a MILO disk.. I had never tried
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; building a MILO disk by hand, only by rawriting images and since this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't an image, I just put it on a disk and put osfpal.nh and ldmilo.exe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; along with it, however, when I try to boot with this disk I get:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	Unable to find MILO files in current partition.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	Please insert floppy disk RUFF.MILO #1 and press a key...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Apparently the problem is a file called milo.ful that is created when I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rawrite an image of ruffian, but I can't find any information on how to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; build one anywhere.. what file is this? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Unless my memory is broken (which is entirely possible), I made
<BR>
a FAT disk (dos format, so you can do it from a windows machine), and
<BR>
copied
<BR>
ldmilo.exe (Jay's hacked version)
<BR>
and the milo-2.2.17 on as
<BR>
milo
<BR>
<P>that worked okay, and let me boot the kernel (from
<BR>
which I booted debian :))
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (The image of ruffian that comes with RH 7.0 does not include this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; file, and I get the same error message...weird...)
</EM><BR>
the RH 7.0 doesn't support MILO, so they don't necessarily have the right
<BR>
files on there. But you can use the MILO 2.2.17 to do initrd, so
<BR>
you should be able to get 7.0 on there
<BR>
<P>L.
