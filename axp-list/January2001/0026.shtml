<P>
<EM>&gt;If you are getting errors in &quot;random places&quot; that usually means
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that you have problems with reading meadia; either because media
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are faulty or your reader has troubles with reading it.  Various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;CD readers do not like specific blanks for CD-R or, even worse,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;CD-RW.  Other reader may be ok.
</EM><BR>
<P>my scsi cdrom drive apparently doesnt like cd-r media.  thats the problem with the
<BR>
cd install, but ive been doing it through http over my lan, with no success.  ive
<BR>
also tried ftp over the internet from a known good source.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;You have two CD install from RH 7?  If yes, then installer copies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a huge blob.......
</EM><BR>
<P>im actually using redhat 6.2, which may be part of the problem.  last night i seemed
<BR>
to read a few fairly nasty things about the redhat 6.x series on alpha, they all
<BR>
seem to have suggested the best redhat for alpha is 5.2.
<BR>
on top of that, redhat seems to be fine with seeing the scsi hard drive, so it
<BR>
really should be able to dump the entire cd 10 or 11 times onto the thing if it
<BR>
needed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If you will get assorted errors while reading this pile (a CD reader
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;does not like your media, for example) then there is a pretty good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;chance that 'anaconda' will interpret that as &quot;out of space on a target&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>i had noticed a few odd errors while booting any sort of floppy on the multia.  last
<BR>
night i also read that the flimsy little floppy cable on these machines tends to
<BR>
produce a lot of noise.  this usually leads to weird errors.  anyone ever
<BR>
successfully insulate one of these cables properly?  that may help my cause....
<BR>
<P>thanks,
<BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which device could it possibly be talking about?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  (around 150 Meg or more - something like that) of an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; install image which is basically a mini-system with X windows, various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; utilities, etc.  The idea is to make possible to unmount the first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CD and ask for the second one while still maintaining some resemblance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of integrity. :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Installer attempts to copy that blob on a file system mounted on /
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and, if there is not enough space there, on /usr.  If none of these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; works then basically you are screwed and install over a network.
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chance that 'anaconda' will interpret that as &quot;out of space on a target&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; although this does not has to be true by a long shot.  If you managed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get all this stuff, but it got corrupted in the process, then you can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expect all kind of weird errors later during an installation.
