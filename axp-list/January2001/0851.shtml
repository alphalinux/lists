<P>
since it's a slightly older rev DEC tulip card, you may want to try the
<BR>
tulip, or old_tulip driver instead (I forget exactly which one it is in RH7)
<BR>
<P>there was also a problem w/ the on board NICs on the ruffians, but
<BR>
considering you had it working in 5.2, I think your board is exempt from it.

Subject: New set of problems..
<BR>
<P><P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had already sent this message, but no one answered and I
<BR>
assumed that it was due to it's subject, since the thread was long
<BR>
already... But I still haven't managed to solve this and have now
<BR>
developed new problems.. If someone can help, I would appreciate it...
<BR>
<P>-----
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've finally managed to get RH 7.0 up and running, using
<BR>
ldmilo-ruffian-981020 and a milo that supported 2.2 kernels... however I
<BR>
have a new problem... the DC21142 card that comes with this board was
<BR>
working fine on RH 5.2 and doesn't work anymore... the module I'm using
<BR>
right now is de4x5 and I tried several options:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;insmod de4x5 args='eth0:fdx'
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;insmod de4x5 args='autosense=100Mb'
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;insmod de4x5 args='eth0:fdx autosense=100Mb'
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When using this last setup I get on /var/log/messages:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eth0: media is 100Mb/s full duplex.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the others I get:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eth0: media is unconnected, link down or incompatible connection.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried the tulip module also, but no go...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any ideas?
<BR>

	Meanwhile, I installed a 3com on the machine which is working ok,
but I have a problem with the ftp server... rather weird... it won't
accept a data connection... that means I can login fine.. but if I 'ls' or
anything that implies a data connection I get an error saying the data
connection was refused... I tried several clients, and all give me the
same error (ftp on linux, ftp on win2k, ncftp).. Is this a package problem
or something?
<P>	Btw.. thanks for all you help on getting me set up.. you were all
great!
