<P>
which version of RH are you running? the automounter was broken in 6.2, but
<BR>
last I checked was working in 7.0

Subject: automounting and NIS [a bit OT]
<BR>
<P><P>OK, sorry it's a bit off-topic but in my defense a) the client is a Digital
<BR>
PWS and b) I got no response from the redhat-list crew...
<BR>
<P>Can anyone tell me how to get exported home directories to automount on my
<BR>
PWS?  We have an NIS server that has the maps for our user accounts and
<BR>
their home directories, and it works for all the irix, tru64 and solaris
<BR>
workstations we have but not for this a-linux one.  portmap, autofs and the
<BR>
automount daemon are all running, and NIS is working to the extent that I
<BR>
can get in with my user account but my home directory isn't mounting.  I've
<BR>
been working on this for nearly a week now and I'm starting to feel really
<BR>
stupid.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
