AS1000 should have SRM 5.8 available. If so you should be able to
<BR>
do a &quot;run bios x&quot; to access the mylex's BIOS and configure the disks from
<BR>
there. On a related note, moving to version 3 firmware requires you to have 
<BR>
TWO flash chips. If the board already has v2x firmware it probably does not
<BR>
have
<BR>
a second chip. 
<BR>
<P>Mylex does not sell the upgrade set of chips anymore. Coincidently, There's
<BR>
been a major shortage of flash chips in the industry and especially so with
<BR>
the chip they used for this now retired product. Which is Intel
<BR>
N28F001BX-T120. I've found searching up and down the net no equivilent chip
<BR>
from other manufacturers. Does anyone have one of those semiconductor cross
<BR>
reference books handy? Supposedly AMD makes an equivilent part.  I have in
<BR>
my experimentation found the same intel chip but just a little slower,
<BR>
T-150. My attempts to burn the chips ala rom burner have failed and
<BR>
upgrading from 2x -&gt; 3x has failed as well. 
<BR>
<P>Good luck
<BR>
<P>Peter &lt;-- has two mylex controllers sitting on his desk doing nothing.

|-&gt; &gt; The short answer is: &quot;It does not work&quot;.
<BR>
|-&gt; &gt; The long answer is: &quot;To boot from&quot;
<BR>
|-&gt; &gt; The easy solutions are:
<BR>
|-&gt; &gt; Buy another disk and controller to boot from ( or use a 
<BR>
|-&gt; CDROM or floppy to 
<BR>
|-&gt; &gt; boot)
<BR>
|-&gt; 	Well my (newly acquired) as1000 5/300 sport an on-board 
<BR>
|-&gt; ncr 53c810
<BR>
|-&gt; controller which I intend to use to boot from anyway. (That 
<BR>
|-&gt; way I can
<BR>
|-&gt; continue to use my old hard-disk external scsi cabinet) In 
<BR>
|-&gt; addition I have
<BR>
|-&gt; an old adaptec 1742A that will go into the machine.  
<BR>
|-&gt; &gt; Use another RAID controller that is not so problematic. &gt; 
<BR>
|-&gt; 	My new machine containes one myley dac960 pd-3 and I just
<BR>
|-&gt; wanted to activate it because it is there.  I guess I will 
<BR>
|-&gt; have use it
<BR>
|-&gt; under the windows that came as well with the machine. (Oh dear
<BR>
|-&gt; it's back to dual-boot country) 
<BR>
|-&gt; 	One last question: is the only possibility to configure the
<BR>
|-&gt; controller (v3.xx) in another x86 machine? Or are there du 
<BR>
|-&gt; orr vms tools
<BR>
|-&gt; to do that?
<BR>
|-&gt; 
<BR>
|-&gt; Thank you for the quick answer...
<BR>
