The advansys cards arent supported by the rh  kernel by default and are not
<BR>
recognized in SRM. You'll need to compile your own , once you do that they
<BR>
run fine. For example.

<BR>
|-&gt; I've installed RH6.2 on mine. (haven't been daring enough 
<BR>
|-&gt; to try 7.0 yet).
<BR>
|-&gt; 
<BR>
|-&gt; to change it to SRM, turn the power on and hold the HALT 
<BR>
|-&gt; button in until it
<BR>
|-&gt; comes up in SRM. when it comes up, at the 'P00&gt;&gt;' prompt type in:
<BR>
|-&gt; 'set os_type Unix'
<BR>
|-&gt; 
<BR>
|-&gt; the next time that you reboot it'll come up in SRM from now on.
<BR>
|-&gt; 
<BR>
|-&gt; There's only a few issues to watch for when you install on it.
<BR>
|-&gt; 
<BR>
|-&gt; -&gt;The onboard SCSI card is a 53c810 and shows up as the 
<BR>
|-&gt; first controller in
<BR>
|-&gt; SRM. The only thing that's on it is the CDRom.
<BR>
|-&gt; 
<BR>
|-&gt; I'm not sure if the Advansys card works in AlphaLinux or is 
<BR>
|-&gt; recognised by
<BR>
|-&gt; SRM. if it isn't recognised by SRM you can't boot off of 
<BR>
|-&gt; it. My 5300 has an
<BR>
|-&gt; intraserver card w/ dual 53c875's and a tulip on it that is 
<BR>
|-&gt; fully supported.
<BR>
|-&gt; 
<BR>
|-&gt; check and see if you have the 'stock' dual 875 based card 
<BR>
|-&gt; in there too.
<BR>
|-&gt; 
<BR>
|-&gt; 
<BR>
|-&gt; good luck,
<BR>

<BR>
|-&gt; Hi,
<BR>
|-&gt;     I have just gotten a Digital Server 5000. This is the 
<BR>
|-&gt; one that was
<BR>
|-&gt; made for NT. I plan on running Linux on this box. I know 
<BR>
|-&gt; there are some
<BR>
|-&gt; issues. The most I have been able to gather is that I would need to
<BR>
|-&gt; switch it to SRM(then reboot).
<BR>
|-&gt; 
<BR>
|-&gt; But, I would like to know if anyone can give me some 
<BR>
|-&gt; detailed steps in
<BR>
|-&gt; getting Linux on this box.(I do have RedHat 7 Alpha cd's). 
<BR>
|-&gt; Basically, a
<BR>
|-&gt; little walk trhough on hwo to change the SRM, then do I 
<BR>
|-&gt; boot from floppy
<BR>
|-&gt; or cd, any issues with lilo(or is it milo on Alpha?).
<BR>
|-&gt; 
<BR>
|-&gt; My config:
<BR>
|-&gt; 
<BR>
|-&gt; Digital Server 5000
<BR>
|-&gt; 400MHz 4mb cache 21164 cpu
<BR>
|-&gt; 256mb ram
<BR>
|-&gt; 3com 3c905b 10/100 PCI
<BR>
|-&gt; Integrated scsi on-board + Advansys PCI SCSI card(for external  use)
<BR>
|-&gt; Intergraph Computer Systems video card w/ Cirrus Logic 
<BR>
|-&gt; chipset (Takes up
<BR>
|-&gt; two PCI slots)
<BR>
|-&gt; 4gig hd in a drive sled
<BR>
|-&gt; 
<BR>
|-&gt; 
<BR>
|-&gt; Thank you for all and any help.
<BR>
|-&gt;
