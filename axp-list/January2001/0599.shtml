With regards to your message at 11:58 AM 2/9/01, Mike Foley. Where you stated:
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You miss the point, Mike: It's increasinly frustrating, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; most ports to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Linux goes to the Intel only world.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         I don't think I do. I've been down this road before.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         FX!32 was an awesome engineering effort. There's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         no arguement there. I had many friends that worked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         on it. HOWEVER, it kept Microsoft and others from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         porting natively to Alpha. Why bother when &quot;I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         it'll run under FX!32?&quot;. Instead, all the energy that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         could have gone to helping PORT apps, went into making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         FX!32 run them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         I see that as unfortunate. Linux gives Alpha the chance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         to run a large number of apps natively. Even if they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         aren't optimized, they run native. ie:  No hacks.
</EM><BR>
<P>&lt;flamebait&gt;
<BR>
Oh, quit complaining fellas.
<BR>
<P>Soon enough Intel will make REAL 64 bit CPUs, and code will get written 
<BR>
finally.
<BR>
Then we can stop fooling around and get with the program and run Windows 
<BR>
software like God intended us to!
<BR>
<P>&lt;/flamebait&gt;
<BR>
<P>OK, so the above was a joke, right?
<BR>
<P>No, actually it wasn't.
<BR>
If you want &quot;mainstream&quot; software then buy &quot;mainstream&quot; hardware.
<BR>
<P>You didn't buy an Alpha to run Word on, nor to play Quake on. You bought it 
<BR>
for some very specific purposes.
<BR>
<P>So, if it does not do things outside of that list of specific purposes, is 
<BR>
it such a big problem?
<BR>
<P>After all, you can certainly buy a cheap PC and run everything else on 
<BR>
that, right?
<BR>
And as nearly none of that &quot;other&quot; software will gain much if anything from 
<BR>
the superior floating point and memory bandwidth, you will not need an 
<BR>
Alpha for it, right?
<BR>
Think of an Athlon, P3, or P4 computer as a &quot;compatibility emulator device 
<BR>
for Linux Alpha&quot; and it makes it a much different proposition. At around 
<BR>
$1000 to $2000 it is not even proportionally expensive, is it?
<BR>
<P>You don't buy a Ferrari to pick up groceries in.
<BR>
And you don't complain that it does not seat a family of 6..
<BR>
<P>Just my $.02 worth, anyway..
<BR>
<P>Have a great weekend folks!
<BR>
<P><P>With our best regards,
