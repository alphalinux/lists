The following is from a web page I found that was extremely helpful to me.
<BR>
My machine is actually an XL 266 but I found this step by step method to
<BR>
point me in the right direction enough that it was pretty easy to figure
<BR>
out. I hope it works for you. Bear in mind I did not write this...so any
<BR>
thanks should go to its real author.

This page merely chronicals my successful install of RedHat Linux 6.0 on my
<BR>
DEC Multia via FTP. I tried to be as specific as possible at most points
<BR>
about what I did that finally worked; however, they offer little explanation
<BR>
as to why. These notes do not represent my first try but my final try.

<BR>
Download generic.img and ramdisk.img from the images directory and
<BR>
udb-noname from the milo directory and rawrite.exe from the dosutils
<BR>
directory if you don't already have it.
<BR>
*Use RAWRITE2.EXE to create the MILO disk.
<BR>
Transfer the rawrite.exe and udb-noname files to the same directory in a DOS
<BR>
machine.
<BR>
Use: &quot;rawrite -f udb-noname -d a:&quot; to write the image file to a blank

<BR>
Use dd to create the KERNEL and ROOT disks.
<BR>
Transfer the generic.img and ramdisk.img imaes to the same directory on a
<BR>
Linux machine.
<BR>
Use &quot;dd if=generic.img of=/dev/fd0 bs=1440k&quot; to create the KERNEL disk.
<BR>
Use &quot;dd if=ramdisk.img of=/dev/fd0 bs=1440k&quot; to create the RAMDISK disk.
<BR>
Configure ARC Console and Boot MILO
<BR>
Insert your MILO disk into your Multia and power it up. The ARC 'Boot menu'
<BR>
should appear (eventually).

on the screen, the floppy drive whirs and we end up at a black screen with:
<BR>
<P>No environment present
<BR>
Linux/Alpha Miniloader (MILO) v2.0.35-c5.4 (Fri Mar 19 21:12:40 GMT 1999)
<BR>
MILO: unknown command, try typing Help
<BR>
<EM>MILO&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>**Type 'fd0:' It should respond with something like:
<BR>
<P>Please wait while setting up devices........
<BR>
Major devices are: fd (0002) sd (0008)
<BR>
VFS: Disk change detected on device 2/0
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Replace the KERNEL disk with the RAMDISK disk. Press &lt;return&gt;
<BR>
The Red Hat Linux Welocme screen should appear. Continue with the redhat
<BR>
install...
<BR>
Installing
<BR>
For the most part, the install is pretty standard for a RedHat system and
<BR>
rather straight forward. See the RedHat Install Guide for more information.
<BR>
Here are some particulars for my install.
<BR>
<P>When asked, use fdisk, not Disk Druid to partition your disk.
<BR>
Your first partition should be a DOS partion for MILO of no more than 2 MB.
<BR>
Use 'n' to create a new partion, 't' to change it's type.
<BR>
I made 3 primary partions:
<BR>
sda1: 2 MB FAT16 (DOS) partition
<BR>
sda2: 64 MB Linux Swap partition
<BR>
sda3: 1 GB Linux partion (since I'm just screwing around and not worried
<BR>
about security and whatnot, I made one giant root partition.)
<BR>
I did a custom install and installed the following packages:
<BR>
Printer Support, X Window System, KDE, Mail/WWW/News Tools, File Managers,
<BR>
Graphics Manipulation, X Games, Console Multimedia, X mulitmedia support,
<BR>
Networked Workstation, Network Management Workstation, Emacs, Emacs with X
<BR>
windows, TeX Document Formatting, C Development, Development Libraries, C++
<BR>
Development, X Development, Kernel, Development, Extra Documentation.
<BR>
<P>During a previous attempt I had installed GNOME but it kept crashing my
<BR>
machine so I went with KDE.
<BR>
Booting Linux
<BR>
After the install is done it tries to restart the machine (mine didn't quite
<BR>
restart). Power cycle your Multia and boot into MILO as you did above.
<BR>
Enter 'boot sda3:boot\vmlinuz root=\dev\sda3' at the MILO&gt; prompt.
<BR>
(substitute your linux root partion for both occurrences of sda3 if it is
<BR>
not sda3.
<BR>
After the system boots, login as root.
<BR>
With your MILO disk still in the floppy disk drive, enter 'dd if=/dev/fd0
<BR>
of=/dev/sda1 bs=1440k' to copy MILO to your MILO (DOS) partition.
<BR>
Shutdown your Multia using 'shutdown -h now' and then power cycle you
<BR>
multia.
<BR>
Reconfigure the ARC console to boot MILO from the hard drive. It is similar
<BR>
to the above procedure with the following changes:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;From the 'Boot selections menu:' choose 'Add a boot selection'.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;From 'Select a system partiion for this boot selection:' choose 'New system
</EM><BR>
partion'.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;From 'Enter location of system partition for this boot selection: Select
</EM><BR>
media:' choose SCSI Hard Disk.
<BR>
Enter '0' as the SCSI bus number, '0' as the SCSI ID and '1' for the
<BR>
partition.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;From 'Enter the osloader directory and name:' enter '\linload.exe'.
</EM><BR>
Answer 'Yes' to 'Is the operating system in the same partition as the
<BR>
osloader:
<BR>
Enter '\' as the operation system root directory after erasing any default
<BR>
information.
<BR>
Enter 'LINUX' as a the name for this boot selection'.
<BR>
Answer 'No' to 'Do you want to initialize the debugger at boot time:'.
<BR>
Choose 'Change a boot selection' from the 'Boot selections menu:'
<BR>
Choose 'LINUX' from 'Selection to edit:'.
<BR>
Using the up/down arrow keys, select 'OSLOADFILENAME' and press &lt;return&gt;.
<BR>
Enter '\milo' for the Value. Press &lt;return&gt; once more.
<BR>
Using the up/down arrow keys, select 'OSLOADOPTIONS' and press &lt;return&gt;.
<BR>
Enter 'boot sda3:boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/sda3' after erasing any information
<BR>
that is there and press &lt;return&gt; once more.
<BR>
Press &lt;esc&gt; to return to the 'Boot selections menu:'.
<BR>
Choose 'Setup menu...' from the 'Boot selections menu:'.
<BR>
Choose 'Setup autoboot' from the 'Setup menu:'.
<BR>
Answer 'Yes' to 'Should the system autoboot:'.
<BR>
Enter '20' for Countdown value.
<BR>
Choose 'Supplementary menu, and save changes...' from the 'Setup menu:'.
<BR>
Choose 'Boot menu...' from the 'Supplementary menu:'.
<BR>
To boot linux now, choose 'Boot LINUX' from the 'Boot menu:' else power off
<BR>
to shut down.
<BR>
Next time you power up, linux should boot automatically.
<BR>
Final Notes
<BR>
If your system is exactly the same as mine, the above 'scripts' should work.
<BR>
If not, you may have to make some changes. Feel free to email me if you want
<BR>
to question what I did or offer some advice as to how to do it better. I'd
<BR>
be happy to include any improvements you have to offer in this page.
<BR>
<P>Have fun!

<P><P>* Why didn't I just use rawrite2.exe or dd for all three disks you ask?
Well. I'll tell you. I could not get my KERNEL disk to work when I made it
with rawrite and I could not get my MILO disk to work when I created it
using dd. I read that someone else had problems getting a rawrtite image of
the RAMDISK to work so I used dd for it as well. This is just what worked
for me. BTW, I didn't actually run rawrite from a DOS machine, I did it on
my PowerMac using RealPC.
<P>** At this point, If you replace the MILO disk with the KERNEL disk, and
type 'boot fd0:vmlinux.gz', it will boot right to the point of where it asks
for the RAMDISK (I think)

Subject: Linux on Multia
<P><P>&gt;
&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I am new to this list and I do not know much about alpha or linux.
&gt;
&gt; I recentrly acquired a Multia from a friend of mine. The only thing the
&gt; computer can do right now when I turn it on is the  SRM console.  I have
&gt; red hat 6.2 CD ROM (downloaded using another computer from
&gt; alphalinux.org).
&gt;
&gt; My question/request for help is how to install Linux.
&gt;
&gt; The computer has the 21066 233MHz processor with 56MB physical memory and
&gt; 512kB cashe and I get the following when I ask for the devices detected:
&gt;
&gt; Devices detected by the firmware:
&gt;
&gt; multi(0)video(0)monitor(0)
&gt; multi(0)key(0)keyboard(0)
&gt; multi(0)disk(0)fdisk(0) (Removable)
&gt; multi(0)serial(0)
&gt; multi(0)serial(1)
&gt; scsi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0) (2 partitions) TOSHIBA MK1924FBV 802A
&gt; scsi(0)cdrom(5)fdisk(0) (Removable) CyberDrrSCSI CD-ROM 120S1.30
&gt;
&gt; and the PCI slot information is:
&gt;
&gt; Bus  Virtual Slot  Function  Vendor   Device  Revision  Device Type
&gt;  0        6           0      1000       1        2         SCSI
&gt;  0        7           0      8086     484        3        ISA Bridge
&gt;  0        8           0      1011       2       23        Ethernet
&gt;  0       11           0      1011       4        2        Video Card
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thank you in advance for your help,
