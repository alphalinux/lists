<P>
Carl,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;OKay, so after much studying of SCSI arch. I came to the conclusion that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the problem was my SCSI controller which has two physical busses (68pin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and 50pin) shared on the same SCSI bus.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds like either the IQ 10 PCI (1020 or 1020A) or the QLA 1040B. These
<BR>
have internal 68 and 50 pin connectors as well as a standard 68 pin external
<BR>
connector.  The QLA1040B is a Fast-20 (Ultra) controller while the IQ 1020
<BR>
is a Fast-10 (fast wide) controller.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So, I went down the street and got a dual channel QLogic ISP board.  
</EM><BR>
<P>I assume this is a QLogic QLA 1240 (Fast-20 Ultra) or a QLA 1280 (Fast-40
<BR>
Ultra 2)?  
<BR>
<P>MILO supported it so I figured I was cool.  Come to find out - AlphaBIOS
<BR>
doesn't like it and I can't get SRM on
<BR>
my box for the life of me.  
<BR>
<P>AlphaBIOS &quot;doesn't like it&quot; in what way? Does it report the controller in
<BR>
the device list and can you see the devices attached to it?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I guess SRM doesn't like any of the video cards I have lying around.  Tried
</EM><BR>
an ATI Rage IIc, and a Matrox Mystyque -
<BR>
<EM>&gt;all I get is a blue screen with a flashing cursor in the upper left corner.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>The Matrox Mystique should work fine on SRM 5.x and up.  The SRM 5.3 list is
<BR>
a bit shorter for bootable video controllers (I think it is a limitation of
<BR>
the x86 VGA BIOS emulation that was later improved).  
<BR>
<P>You may kill two birds with one stone (if video perf is not too important)
<BR>
with an Intranserver combined video and single or dual Fast Ethernet
<BR>
controller. These are Tru64 and OpenVMS compatible.  Remember to hit return
<BR>
a few times on the keyboard to get the &gt;&gt;&gt; prompt.  If you don't, you may be
<BR>
in serial console mode.  There are some good references to backing out to
<BR>
graphical console on the AlphaLinux.org site.  Go to the search engine on
<BR>
the top right hand corner and type in &quot;console mode&quot; you should get a hit.
<BR>
<P>Good luck,
<BR>
<P>--KE
