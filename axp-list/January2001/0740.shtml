On Wed, Sep 27, 2000 at 07:34:49PM -0400, S.D. Brown came forth with:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I have an AlphaPC 164 (Ruffian) and I have the desire to drop a sound
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; card into it.  My problem is that the Hardware Compatibility Lists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are not so helpful for sound cards because the model names change so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; often.  So far I have tried a newer &quot;Creative Ensoniq AudioPCI&quot; which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has a CT5880 chip on it and an &quot;Asound Express 32-bit PnP&quot; with an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Avance ALS4000 chip on it.  I have tried the default RedHat modules
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I have tried the OSS demo modules with no luck.  The CT5880 simply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does not work (/dev/dsp: Device not configured&quot;) and the ALS4000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spits back errors from any application that tries to use it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
I submitted this message back in September and it just showed up on the
<BR>
list this week.  In the mean time, let me fill you all in.
<BR>
<P>The short summary of my solution was this: fall back to a good old
<BR>
ISA SoundBlaster 16 card that I picked up from a used computer store
<BR>
for $10.  Kudzu found it on boot and grabbed the right drivers, etc.
<BR>
All my apps (including mpg123) worked just fine for all the sources
<BR>
I had (MP3, wav, etc.).  
<BR>
<P>I had been exchanging mail with the folks at OSS about the CT5880 and 
<BR>
ALS4000 based boards on Alpha and about a week after I was cruising 
<BR>
along with my ISA card they sent me some new modules to try.  Unfortunatly, 
<BR>
I had returned the PCI cards (minus the 10% restocking fee) so I didn't 
<BR>
get a chance to try them.  I have heard from various folks that the ALS4000
<BR>
does indeed work these days.
