<EM>&gt;          Samsung fabs Alpha's in Korea and has for a number
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;          of years. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;          You'd have to ask Intel if they are still fabbing Alpha's in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;          old DEC plant in Hudson, but I don't think they are. Primarily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;          StrongARM and PCI chips I think. (Just a guess)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
It was pretty well known that the PCI chips were what kept the Hudson fab
<BR>
from loosing its shirt, the Alpha chips were &quot;lost leaders.&quot;  And I don't
<BR>
believe that StrongARM ever achieved money-making quanities like the PCI
<BR>
chips did either. I was once told that the Hudson fab provided something
<BR>
like 60% of the PCI chips used in the industry! (No idea how true that
<BR>
statement might have been.)
<BR>
<P>Intel actually got a turkey when they bought Hudson. About the only thing
<BR>
they got was the site. Which for fabs is important. So assuming that Hudson
<BR>
is &quot;rock solid,&quot; the contents of the plant might not have been important.
<BR>
Especially with the other assorted &quot;technology licensing&quot; stuff that went
<BR>
along with the settlement. Also, buying the fab was probably a cheap &quot;out
<BR>
of court settlement&quot; for Intel.
<BR>
<P>Dec's switch to Samsung resulted in a 20% performance jump simply by
<BR>
switching fab technologies. Some have said a 10-15 year difference in fab 
<BR>
technology. DS20Es were DRAMATICALLY faster than everyone (in the field at
<BR>
least) expected compared to the DS20s -- and at the same clock rates.
<BR>
<P>The IBM copper fab jump is rumored to produce a similar jump in
<BR>
performance. I guess we'll see at Wednesday's announcements. (I assume they
<BR>
are still on for the 24th.)
