<BR>
<P><P>Ok,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a PWS 433a which was running RH6.2 and running as a
<BR>
workstation and, a xp1000 running RH6.2 setup as a server, I frequently use
<BR>
FTP to transfer files between these two systems and a 4.0F Unix system and
<BR>
have had no problems.    The xp1000 is setup as an FTP server, the PWS433 is
<BR>
only a client.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other day I upgraded both systems to RH7.0, and immediately ran
<BR>
into the new &quot;passive&quot; mode default setting, If I connect to the Unix 4.0F
<BR>
systems from the 433a using ftp and try to copy an image I get a &quot;entering
<BR>
passive mode, connection refused&quot; message, If I then do a  &quot;pass off&quot;
<BR>
everything work ok which is what I expect...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if I connect to the xp1000, from the 433a, I get the same
<BR>
message, If I then enter the command &quot;pass off&quot;  I then get a &quot;cannot build
<BR>
data connection&quot; which is a different error. There is nothing in the logs,
<BR>
has anyone seen this?  Server Version is   wu-ftpd 2.6.1(1)  
<BR>
