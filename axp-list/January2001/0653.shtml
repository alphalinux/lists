<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe.  I am waiting to get convinced.  In words of Linus: &quot;Show me the

<BR>
<P>Is that really what Linus meant? ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Over many years I see from Java proponents mostly hot air and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legal squables.  From the very beginning it looked to me that Java is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just a badly rewritten Objective-C, mostly to make a false impression on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; C++ programmers that they know what is going on, plus tons of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; marketting crap.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you s/Java/Sun/g I mostly agree.  I don't care much about the business
<BR>
side, and I don't care about Sun.  Luckily they can't fully control
<BR>
Java.  Now that they've dealt with Microsoft, there are various free
<BR>
implementations against which they have no recourse.  Some of these have
<BR>
improved on Sun's mistakes.
<BR>
<P>Objective-C was a good language too, but doomed to obscurity.  Java
<BR>
actually improved on Obj-C in a number of ways, for example strings as
<BR>
objects, automatic memory management, and multithread support.  I'm a
<BR>
convert on the first two... still undecided about threads :\
<BR>
<P>Consider bytecode.  OK, portable execution and interpreted runtimes are
<BR>
not such a great idea.  But bytecode also provides something the C++ guys
<BR>
should be envious of: the equivalent of precompiled headers.  You can
<BR>
think of jar archives as large repositories of type information.  For
<BR>
that, Java bytecode is a big win.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; gcj is great but it is not written in Java. :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>You want the compiler written in Java?  Interesting idea.  Actually its a
<BR>
nice language for abstract data types, and there are plenty of those in a
<BR>
compiler.
<BR>
<P>But the FSF has a tradition of using plain old C for free software.  Plus
<BR>
you have a bootstrap problem if the compiler is Java.  Not unsolvable, but
<BR>
what do you gain?  (I've heard that part of GNAT, the GNU Ada compiler,
<BR>
is written in Ada.  So there is a precedent for it.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It is not that I do not appreciate efforts of Blackdown guys, and Uncle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; George in particular.  Far from it.  But troubles he got in, and mostly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not of a technical nature, did nothing to elevate Java's image in my eyes.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, s/Java/Sun/ and I agree.
<BR>
<P>Just so this thread isn't completely off topic, I'll mention that GCC 3.0
<BR>
branched this week (so it'll be released &quot;real soon now&quot;) and will
<BR>
completely support Alpha/Linux.  In the meantime anyone can try it by
<BR>
downloading a snapshot dated 2/1 or later.  (I could post binaries
<BR>
somewhere too.)
