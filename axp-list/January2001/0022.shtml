<P>
<EM>&gt; Interesting...I had not time to look into the libtool issue.  What you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have found is interesting.  I'm a bit confused about the steps you have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; described.  Are you saying to do  1) alias gcc=ccc, 2) run ./configure,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then 3) run ./ltconfig or are you saying do 3) before 2).  If I do 3
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before 2, then configure wipes out the libtool that ltconfig built.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>The procedure is 1) 3) 2) :-).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It's doing it when I try this procedure on SDL.  Also if I do 3 after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2, then the libtool file does not match what came out of configure.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (I'm not sure if the mismatch is really a problem or not.)
</EM><BR>
<P><P>It shouldnt do that. configure should load the libtool previously
<BR>
created unless
<BR>
it's creating it's own libtool as &quot;part&quot; of the script. 
<BR>
It works here with MySQL and php consistantly.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Something strange is going on in configure.  There's something in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; configure that says if I'm not gcc, then don't create a shared lib.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It gets worse if you specify CFLAGS in the environment, then it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't work at all (gcc pukes on my -arch switch).  It seems to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be calling /usr/bin/gcc directly.
</EM><BR>
<P>You see. The whole idea of libtool is to use &quot;it&quot; to call your compiler
<BR>
so your makefile remains independant of such things and thus more
<BR>
flexiable.
<BR>
<P>The configure file that comes with SDL is doing something wrong. Is this
<BR>
just the SDL tarball or the current SDL rpm from RH? I want to try and
<BR>
reproduce 
<BR>
what you're seeing.
