<P><EM>&gt; No, actually it wasn't.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you want &quot;mainstream&quot; software then buy &quot;mainstream&quot; hardware.
</EM><BR>
<P>Except people like me who absolute HATE the whole x86 idea. It is the
<BR>
shittiest  arch I've EVER seen!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You didn't buy an Alpha to run Word on, nor to play Quake on. You bought it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for some very specific purposes.
</EM><BR>
<P>I did, except it was applixware and not word in my case.. and I still
<BR>
haven't gotten quake to work on a 32bpp display (grrr). I never liked
<BR>
winblow$ to begin with, so why would I want to run it?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So, if it does not do things outside of that list of specific purposes, is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it such a big problem?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, see above.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; After all, you can certainly buy a cheap PC and run everything else on 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that, right?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes and that cheap PeeCee has PeeCee quality and performance behind it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And as nearly none of that &quot;other&quot; software will gain much if anything from 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the superior floating point and memory bandwidth, you will not need an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha for it, right?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well yes, but.. things like nutscrape load in about 2 seconds on my
<BR>
system and takes over 10 on a similarly configured x86. Not to
<BR>
meantion how shitty arch x86 is for just about anything (especially
<BR>
coding). Plus I've always found that Alphas multitask better (not sure
<BR>
why that one is).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Think of an Athlon, P3, or P4 computer as a &quot;compatibility emulator device 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for Linux Alpha&quot; and it makes it a much different proposition. At around 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; $1000 to $2000 it is not even proportionally expensive, is it?
</EM><BR>
<P>At $2k I could have built me a nice 21164 system or bought a bare
<BR>
bones 21264... Besides, why would I want an x86 for? paper weight?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You don't buy a Ferrari to pick up groceries in.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And you don't complain that it does not seat a family of 6..
</EM><BR>
<P>No I didn't because the trunk is too small and they don't have cup
<BR>
holders!!! Besides, I personally am more into restoring older vehicles
<BR>
and putting large engines in them. (-; Also I am a pickup truck type
<BR>
person, so I'd be more likely to buy say.. a hummer!
<BR>
<P>JMO:-)
