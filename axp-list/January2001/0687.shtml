<EM>&gt; &gt; If I look at the various documents (mainly Powerpoint slides) of DEC,

<EM>&gt; &gt; Compaq, and Samsung/API conferences and releases of 4 years ago until last
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; year, I see a common thread in that we should already be running EV7, newer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Alpha chipsets, and well over 1GHz.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Probably.  But what's the hangup on clock speed?  If Intel/AMD have everyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thinking their slower Alpha/PPC/SPARC/whatever is inferior, they've won a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;major
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;marketing battle.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;1GHz isn't a real &quot;barrier&quot; in any engineering sense.  The memory wall is very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;real in comparison, and has a far more profound impact on system performance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nowadays than clock speed.  But nobody is interested in that :(
</EM><BR>
It is a marketing barrier and a perception barrier though..
<BR>
Intel HAD to have a faster clockrate chip than the Athlon, and as they 
<BR>
couldn't push the P3 beyond 1GHz they released the P4 early with piddly 8K 
<BR>
L1 cache, a crippled floating point engine, and a pre-release scheduler.
<BR>
So, in most software the P3 at 1GHz kicks the P4 - 1.5GHz in the butt.
<BR>
<P>However, Alpha has &quot;stalled at the jump&quot; for 667 to 833 taking 2 years, and 
<BR>
the jump to 1GHz not yet even at a real ship date yet. Even the 833 are 
<BR>
still mainly vapourware. We were promised CPUs in December, then January, 
<BR>
then February.. You guessed it.
<BR>
&nbsp;From what I can tell so far Samsung has shipped a couple of hundred, API 
<BR>
none, and Compaq perhaps some in ES40's although I get conflicting reports 
<BR>
on that, whether they are actually a &quot;production&quot; product, or a 
<BR>
pre-production sampling for PR purposes..
<BR>
Anyone I know who tried to order them has been told &quot;April&quot; unless they 
<BR>
happened to be a high enough PR profile for Compaq to get them some 
<BR>
&quot;special&quot; product.
<BR>
Apparently from what I hear the problem is not so much in the CPU but in 
<BR>
some components that go with it on the processor daughtercard modules, such 
<BR>
as the DDR cache RAM chips..
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Gimmee faster cache, and lots of it...
</EM><BR>
Exactly, and there is the problem..  &lt;grin&gt;
