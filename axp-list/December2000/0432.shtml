I'm not 100% sure, because I only have a 1.6GB&nbsp;IDE&nbsp;disk myself,
but I can't see why there should be any limitation that would not let you
use the whole 10GB. I have a Multia myself, and I just want to caution
you to remember to upgrade the firmware to one that is IDE&nbsp;capable
at all., because when I started using my Multia I hadn't ensured that and
the machine just couldn't see the disk :-)
<p>So without messing up the 10GB&nbsp;disk, you could just install it
and then boot the Multia as you normally do and see if Linux will recognize
it. Using fdisk afterwards to look at the disk (or hdparm) shouldn't do
it any harm in case you see that it doesn't work the way you want. If it
doesn't you can just pop it back into the PC&nbsp;where you took it. Isn't
the PC&nbsp;BIOS&nbsp;flashupgradable? Then you might become able to use
the disk there after all.
<p>Then I would like to ask you what kernel you are using on the Multia?
I haven't been able to either compile or successfully run a 2.4.0 kernel
(I attempted with both testing and the latest prerelease), and I did check
the Documentation/Changes file. I am running RedHat 6.2 installed as a
server and then I added the kernel source myself. Any information you can
give would be appreciated.
<p>Thanks,

<p>Before I potentially make a real mess, will (1) the Multia firmware

<p>I was going to keep the 10gb in my Intel Multia, but the peecee BIOS
<br>refuses to work with anything over 8gb, and I need to use this drive.
