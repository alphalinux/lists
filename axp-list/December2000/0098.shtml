Can you afford to re install?
<BR>
<P>Jump start Is a program from Compaq, what it does is:
<BR>
Alpha JumpStart! is a powerful and versatile tool designed to help overcome
<BR>
many of the traditional difficulties of installing and running Linux on
<BR>
Alpha systems.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
It will:
<BR>
<P>provide a graphical interface that makes installing Linux easy 
<BR>
make a corrupted system bootable 
<BR>
function as a Linux boot CD 
<BR>

<BR>
<P>This should get you on your way.
<BR>
It requires that you have an SRM Consol.

Subject: problem after upgrade to SRM
<BR>
<P><P>Hi,
<BR>
<P>I have 164LX machine, and for 2 years I've been booting from MILO
<BR>
floppy and then typing command:
<BR>
<P>boot hda3:/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.14-6.0 root=/dev/hda3
<BR>
<P>Today I upgraded to latest firmware, which means SRM.  Now I can't
<BR>
figure out how to boot into Linux.  I tried from SRM prompt
<BR>
<P>boot dqa -fi /boot/vmlinuz-2.2.14-6.0 -fl root=/dev/hda3
<BR>
<P>but it says 'block 0 of dqa is not a valid boot block'.  I am guessing
<BR>
I need 2nd stage ramdisk, but honestly I don't picture the whole boot
<BR>
process quite well.  I read SRM howto, and it talks about getting
<BR>
aboot or raw boot installed.  But if I can't boot to the system, how
<BR>
can I install those?
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I know it's pretty pathetic, but I'd really appreciate if
<BR>
some1 could point me to the simplest way of booting into my system
<BR>
based on the info above, I'd greatly appreciate it.
<BR>
<P>Thanks
<BR>
<P>Igor
