<P>
The reason that writes are slower than reads on HDs is that the drive has to
<BR>
generate ECC information, but more importantly, the drive re-reads the data back
<BR>
in to check that it was written successfully (RAW - ReadAfterWrite).  As you can
<BR>
see, much optimization is done in the drive itself so that write performance isn't
<BR>
half of read performance.

As you can see they can pull 30MB/sec in reads, but only 20MB/sec in writes.
<BR>
Again buffering is the biggest difference between the two rates.
<BR>
Think of it this way:
<BR>
How can the rates be different?
<BR>
Same platter, same rotation speed, same density, same heads, same bus, same 
<BR>
everything. It's not like the drive is  slowing down it's spin rate for writes!
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Especially interesting to see as the write proceeds to fill the disks, the 
<BR>
rate drops from about 23MB/sec to under 20MB/sec.
<BR>
This is because it is going from the longer outer tracks to the shorter 
<BR>
inner ones.
<BR>
Same spin rate means less media is passing the heads.
<BR>
<P>As for price these are $299 USD SRP drives. 60GB, 7200rpm, 2MB cache.
<BR>
That's $4.98/GB
