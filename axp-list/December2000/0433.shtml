It turns out the peecee will keep the 10gb HD.  There was a BIOS setting
<BR>
buring inthere for &quot;large disk access mode DOS/OTHER&quot; and I picked OTHER
<BR>
and now it works.  The BIOS is Phoenix 4.057 in a Pentium100 Multia, and
<BR>
there is no later upgrade - Phoenix is notoriously bad about that kind of
<BR>
thing.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I don't have the AXP Multia powered up right now (I got a
<BR>
McMaster-Carr fan upgrade and I need to get that in there before I play
<BR>
with the Multia any more, I feel like its liviing on borrowed time), but
<BR>
whatever kernel comes from the stock RH6.2 install is the one I am using.
