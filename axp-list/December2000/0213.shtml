<EM>&gt; I still have this problem on my Alpha SX164

<EM>&gt; and have had for almost a year now.  I have gone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; through every possible iteration of /etc/svc.conf,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; etc. etc. etc.  It is really driving me banana's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I am desperately hoping that upgrading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to RH 7.0 will fix the problem.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is not likely to change anything as these are Tru64 binaries,
<BR>
and their supporting libraries, and as such are rather distribution
<BR>
independent.  You may equally well install that on any system with
<BR>
5.x distro (which I did, by the way, and it works without any problems)
<BR>
as long as your kernel has support for ECOFF (&quot;AOUT&quot;) binaries.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Nothing that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has been suggested to Peter has worked for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me and I have tried many other things as well.
</EM><BR>
<P>Did you try to set MOZILLA_NO_ASYNC_DNS environmental variable?
<BR>
This is known to help in certain circumstances.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Peter can confirm that he has the same problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I do by going into netscape and opening
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a web page BY IP ADDRESS.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which means that your name resolution has problems. One possible
<BR>
suggestion to try would be to set your machine as a name server
<BR>
(&quot;cache-only&quot; should be good enough and there is a prepared setup
<BR>
like that in your distro) and point all your name resolution to it.
<BR>
Maybe responses from a name server you are using right now are so
<BR>
slow that Netscape is loosing a patience?  Or maybe you have some
<BR>
proxy/firewall in between which is mangling packets?
<BR>
<P>Other than that you can get tcpdump and start tracing packets to
<BR>
find out what is going on.  'ethereal' from Powertools may make that
<BR>
easier but there was a recent security update for it.
