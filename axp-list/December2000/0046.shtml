<EM>&gt; hdparm is pretty bogus though. try bonnie/bonnie++/tiozone.

<P>hdparm does give an indication of the disk speed.
<BR>
It's just limited to a small portion of the platter
<BR>
so it's not representative of the rest of the platter.
<BR>
<P>I like the test below for measuring disk speed.

<EM>&gt; that's not bad at all.

<EM>&gt; here's a question: what happens if you do that 10GB read twice in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parallel (and do you have a scsi system to compare with?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Due to caching, it reads both streams in the same
<BR>
elapsed time as one stream. 
<BR>
<P>I run several hundred GB of SCSI. The SCSI drives
<BR>
are slower than the UATA drives. (50GB 7200rpm Seagates
<BR>
are good for mid-20MB/sec performance)
<BR>
<P>As has been mentioned, there are reasons to use Cheetahs.
<BR>
In fact, if you are small I/O bound, the more spindles you
<BR>
have the better so that multiple requests don't interfere
<BR>
with each other. All HD's perform worse when you hit them
<BR>
with multiple I/O requests to different zones on the disk
<BR>
due to seek times. A Cheetah has the fastest average seek
<BR>
time so it can do the most small I/O's in that case. It is 
<BR>
interesting to note that if you consider disk size, the seek 
<BR>
speed of the 60GB 7200rpm UATA drive mentioned in the other 
<BR>
post is actually quite good. It averaged around 14.5ms seek 
<BR>
time. The X15 Cheetah is around 4ms. However, since the Cheetah
<BR>
is only 18GB, and the UATA drive is 60GB, the amount of data
<BR>
covered per ms of seek is quite close, 4.14GB/ms vs 4.5GB/ms.
<BR>
Basically, around 10% difference, Cheetahs of course are the
<BR>
faster drives but not by much.
