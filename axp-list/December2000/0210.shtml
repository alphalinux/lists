<EM>&gt; Consider why there are two C compilers in RH7.0.

<P>With this it is even well-known where.  All familiar with these issues
<BR>
acknowledge for quite a while that there are spots in Linux kernel
<BR>
sources which depend too heavy on a particular compiler behaviour.
<BR>
Those with a less benign disposition are calling them simply &quot;bugs&quot;.
<BR>
Some points are disputed in that if some undocumented corners should
<BR>
behave that or another way but this does not change the picture
<BR>
overall.  Remember that Linux kernel is not, and never was, written in
<BR>
Standard C but is some dialect implemented by gcc and this hits from
<BR>
time to time.
<BR>
<P>Things are getting cleaned but the matter is delicate and this will
<BR>
take a while.  Besides the situation is not exactly equivalent for
<BR>
x86 and other architectures; Alpha in particular.  OTOH asking from
<BR>
a distribution maker to put together the whole thing substantially
<BR>
differently for every architecture would be way too much.
<BR>
<P>Not that I want to claim that everything is hunky-dory, as it is not,
<BR>
but it makes me wonder why when there were similar issues in the past
<BR>
(they were, in times quite a bit more severe than now) there was only a
<BR>
bit of grumbling here and there and now we have all these noisy
<BR>
discussions?
<BR>
<P>BTW - a separate compiler in a distribution for a kernel is a Debian
<BR>
&quot;invention&quot; and 'kgcc' name, now picked wider, comes from Conectiva.
