<P>
<EM>&gt; I was wondering what is the usually percentage that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; /var, /usr, /home, and ect  partitions should be..
</EM><BR>
<P>This is going to be fun. This question is about as religious as the one for
<BR>
the &quot;best editor&quot;.
<BR>
<P>I'll try and give my opinion - but only for servers, not workstations:
<BR>
<P>a. Don't use percentages - use what you need in certain partitions, leave
<BR>
the rest for future use.
<BR>
<P>b. my usual choices:
<BR>
/ will hardly ever need more than 200 MB
<BR>
<P>/usr on a server with no X is usually between 200 MB and 500 MB if you
<BR>
really only install what you need. I usually give it a GB to be safe with a
<BR>
couple of kernels, sambas and whatever I need to compile.
<BR>
<P>/var depends on the server's tasks. One of my web servers easily gets a GB
<BR>
logs daily,
<BR>
mail spools can be worse, same goes for squid proxies. I usually start with
<BR>
a GB here unless I know in advance it is going to be more
<BR>
<P>/root is root's home directory, i.e. new packages to be installed, the
<BR>
server docs you will of course write ;-) will completing the server
<BR>
configuration and the like  - 300-500 MB will do here
<BR>
<P>For /tmp I usually give 250-500 MB, depending on the disk size
<BR>
<P>/home only depends on how many users you have and what you'll allow them. An
<BR>
rpm install of ftp and http servers will put there data here.
<BR>
<P>/opt is hardly ever used under linux these days, again unless you have X. I
<BR>
make it 100 MB to be safe that a package does rather fail upon install than
<BR>
bust /.
<BR>
<P>On Intel I would always put a 30 MB /boot at the beginnging of the disk just
<BR>
to make sure lilo doesn't get in trouble.
<BR>
<P>I usually leave the rest free so I can use it where I need it when I need
<BR>
it. (webspace, database, even bigger mail spool, whatever). Others will have
<BR>
better suggestoin. Listen to them all and find your personal guesstimates.
<BR>
<P>Good luck!
<BR>
<P>Ingo
