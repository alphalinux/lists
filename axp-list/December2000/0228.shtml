<EM>&gt; OK. This then begs the question &quot;how many C compilers shipped with RH7.0

<EM>&gt; Alpha?&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't have it so I don't know off hand. Did they do the same thing on Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as x86, gcc and kgcc? One would assume only one if (2) is really the case.

<P>There are two.  The reason is this - it is well known that the Linux
<BR>
kernel depends on known compiler behavior.  While I'm doing fine
<BR>
running my 2.96-built kernels, there is that distant chance that there
<BR>
may be some timing bug in some diver that a customer uses that will
<BR>
pop up and corrupt their data.  Now, my feeling is that most of this
<BR>
is kernel developers feeling uneasy about 'new things'.  That's just
<BR>
my opinion.
<BR>
<P>I think that the sooner that we can get developers using a new GCC
<BR>
codebase the better.  GCC 3.0 is very important to the Linux and GNU
<BR>
communities.  Hopefully with the fixes in 2.2.18 and the general
<BR>
fixups in 2.4.x, developers will give 2.96 built kernels a try.  If
<BR>
folks run into problems, we're here to find them and fix them.  If the
<BR>
problem is in the kernel, we'll fix it there.  If it's in GCC, we'll
<BR>
do the same.  I personally feel that the GNU/Linux development
<BR>
platform will be better for it.
