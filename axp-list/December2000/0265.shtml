At 13:26 18/12/2000 -0700, it was written:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;It is somewhat frustrating when various people over time are telling in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a response to a complaint &quot;It looks like that your DNS is set
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;incorrectly&quot; and after that you annouce &quot;Big News!  By a long trial and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;error it was established that my DNS is set incorrectly&quot;.  Indeed.
</EM><BR>
<P>While this sort of generic response may be fine for experienced Linux 
<BR>
users, raw newbies (such as myself) are often frustrated by these sort of 
<BR>
responses.  Yes, I have read the man page, and it was still unclear.  Not 
<BR>
until a plain English answer was offered did I know what to change.  For 
<BR>
the record, my /etc/resolv.conf file did not have any search line in 
<BR>
it.  If I was not informed by Peter Watkinson of what exactly to put into 
<BR>
this file, I would still be none the wiser.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Let's see what documentation happens to say.  From 'man 5 resolver':
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;.....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      search   Search list for host-name lookup.  The search list is normally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;               determined from the local domain name; by default, it contains
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;               only the local domain name.  This may be changed by listing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;               desired domain search path following the search keyword with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;               spaces or tabs separating the names.  Most resolver queries 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will
</EM><BR>
<P>&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<P>This may as well be in French for the most part.  I am running a single 
<BR>
box, no &quot;domain&quot;, and a randomly assigned IP address.  As far as I could 
<BR>
tell, it was not relevant to my case.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;For most dial-up connections it is quite clear that this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;line is just superfluous.  Did you notice, conditional, &quot;slow&quot; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;a lot of network traffic&quot; and &quot;will time out&quot; above?
</EM><BR>
<P>It may well be superfluous, but putting it in resolv.conf, and running bind 
<BR>
on the same machine has fixed a lot of problems.  Not real good for 
<BR>
security (maybe ... I don't know), but it works.
