<P>
don't forget 9)  you get an up to date PAL code.  Someone at dec has a performance ( profiling) system that
<BR>
uses the 'meters' available with the SRM's palcode. The palcode that comes with milo just does not have the
<BR>
code:-/  When one tries this switchover ( ARC -&gt; SRM ) , one sees quite plainly that when u want the SRM  -
<BR>
BUT u also need to buy into a DIFFERENT set of supported hardware (problems!) .

<P><EM>&gt; 1. You can run some very sophisticated diagnostics on the hardware from it.
</EM><BR>
<P>u might, if u know how, or do it. How many of u let your car warm up (stabilize) before driving it?. Arc seems
<BR>
to do more ( maybe I should say spend more time doing ) mem testing without having to ask for it. Maybe I
<BR>
should ask if u run FSCK ( fsck -f )  every time u boot up  to insure that your disks are ok? I also find it
<BR>
difficult to believe that there will be any diagnostics for the ISA 3com 3c509b nic card i have in my lx.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2. You can boot several OSs from it. (linux,Tru64,OpenVMS,*BSD)
</EM><BR>
<P>Missing NT. Although the jenson could do both.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3. You can netboot from it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Must buy supported net card
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4. You can run diskless from it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Must buy supported netcard
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 5. It's simple, efficent console.
</EM><BR>
<P>So was DOS, but look who's winning now!  Its also not simple to use, or intuitive. Can u create  a DOS/FAT
<BR>
partition using the SRM ? Can u 'disklabel' using the SRM.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 6. You don't have to hop through ten levels of windows/screens to get to the function/information you want.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup. But there's not really that much info I want from a console program. This also presumes that u know how
<BR>
to ask it ( nice  :-)  ) !  do You know how long it took me to figure out how to set the HW clock?  How long (
<BR>
hops before ur ttl expires ) would it take u to figure out  that this function is just not available,
<BR>
considering that just about everyone has a way to do it from the console, without booting anything!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 7. It can be ran through serial connection without having to remember some keycode to mimic navigation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Im not sure what will happen if  ARC lost the keyboard/console.  For NT this would be a total loss. As would
<BR>
any other Windoz system
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 8. It is still supported and development will continue.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes it is. But I suppose that development will continue to support things that are supported by Dec. Its hard
<BR>
to support everything that is available ( or will be available ) in the world. You just dont get a lot of
<BR>
other manufacturers making available 'DRIVERS' for the SRM on an alpha that can be loaded from a floppy!
