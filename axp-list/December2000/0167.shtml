Hi Michal,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Is any specific reason why are you using here a development kernel,
</EM><BR>
with
<BR>
<EM>&gt;all possible troubles which may come with that, for something which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sounds like a pretty standard &quot;production&quot; use?
</EM><BR>
<P>Oops, no! The system in production is an x86/2.2.17 with ipchains.
<BR>
<P>It's just that I will get a new department hooked up to this network
<BR>
which needs a more flexible fw with more connection tracking and the
<BR>
like. Netfilter/iptables from 2.4 would do most of what I need out of
<BR>
the box which I cannot easily provide with ipchains. To see if this is
<BR>
a viable path I am now in the process of setting up a testbed with an
<BR>
alpha to replace the x86 and 2.4 to replace 2.2.17.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;There is something wrong with this picture.  Do a bit of a
</EM><BR>
back-envelope
<BR>
<EM>&gt;arithmetic.  Tasks which you are talking about should barely
</EM><BR>
register,
<BR>
<P>Top shows itself as the only non-idle task, while &quot;system time&quot; is at
<BR>
99%. 100 MBit/s in my arithmetic is roughly 10 MByte/s, I only get an
<BR>
accumalated 3,6 MByte/s when http'ing _through_ that box in both ways
<BR>
from multiple clients to multiple servers. Am I totally off with some
<BR>
figures or concept here?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;You have only 100MBit/sec so it will not take long to use it all.  We
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are not talking here about an Internet backbone.  This is only a
</EM><BR>
speed
<BR>
<EM>&gt;of a faster standard ethernet connection.  Do you really think that
</EM><BR>
most
<BR>
<EM>&gt;machines around is either only pushing packets, without doing any
</EM><BR>
useful
<BR>
<EM>&gt;work, or it has vast resources to spare?
</EM><BR>
<P>I am afraid I can't follow you here (please be kind, it might be a
<BR>
problem with my English).
<BR>
<P>To make my picture a little clearer: The machine has no other task
<BR>
that pushing or filtering packets. On both sides there are Suns
<BR>
(Netras + a E450 in production, Ultra5s and an Ultra10 in staging). We
<BR>
produce news content in the order of a few GB of which a small part
<BR>
changes every couple of minutes. Plus we now have a few hundred, but
<BR>
soon &gt;1000 VERY active internet users (newspaper/trade mag/online
<BR>
production).
<BR>
<P>BTW: This IS a fast Ethernet connection to a city-wide
<BR>
ring (fiber optic I think) (in Hamburg) that connects us to our
<BR>
providers' backbone (&gt;=155MBit/s) and thus to our production cluster
<BR>
at the ISPs headquarter in Frankuft. We do have &gt;=100 MBit/s all the
<BR>
way there. So I guess this is what you'd call an &quot;internet backbone&quot;.
<BR>
