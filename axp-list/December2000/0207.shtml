<P>
I did a complete brand new installation of RH 7.0
<BR>
on a brand new disk.  Netscape gives the same
<BR>
darned  error as always, DNS isn't working,
<BR>
you have got a problem with your $SOCKS_NS
<BR>
variable crap.
<BR>
<P>I did the edit on svc.conf and removed every
<BR>
mention of yp, I left local,bind on nameservice.
<BR>
<P>This is really beginning to hack me off.  The worst
<BR>
problem this error causes me is that seti at home
<BR>
appears not to be planning an update the alphaev5
<BR>
unknown-linux version.  I have tried running the
<BR>
Tru64 version and it just runs beautifully until it
<BR>
comes time to finish, send the data set home and
<BR>
get another.  The same DNS problem prevents
<BR>
it from doing any kind of exchange with the seti
<BR>
at home servers.  This problem needs to be
<BR>
resolved and I am at my wits end with it.
