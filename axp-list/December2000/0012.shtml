<P>With the exception of Humungous Database Servers, virtually all computers 
<BR>
deal in small, random disk accesses -- things like web servers or news
<BR>
servers, mail servers, general purpose time-sharing machines, DNS servers,
<BR>
and anything that EVER uses swap (aka Virtual Memory). The emphasis is on
<BR>
random, unless the box is dedicated to only ONE application. And even
<BR>
&quot;gifs&quot; are small. Streaming  video and I assume audio, are (I guess) based
<BR>
on humungous block sizes.... but then again maybe not, if the &quot;stream&quot; is
<BR>
optimized for a 33.6K modem. [Video/graphics editing are about the only
<BR>
applications I can think of where there are huge files, which are not
<BR>
databases.] [And Humungous Database Servers cram everything into memory for
<BR>
performance reasons anyway. Ever see an Oracle server &quot;boot up&quot; and take 30
<BR>
or 60 minutes just to load the data into many gigs worth of main memory?
<BR>
All they ever do is write to disk; they &quot;never&quot; read from disk once the
<BR>
server is loaded. ANY disk I/O is simply too slow.]
<BR>
<P>But small is relative to track size.
<BR>
<P>The real I/O size that matters is the size being written to or read from
<BR>
the disk. 
<BR>
<P>I'm going into dusty corners of the brain now so I may not have the details
<BR>
right... Back in the old days of Ultrix 4.4 (circa 1992?), they (Eric
<BR>
Schott, I think) discovered that deep down in the bowels of the I/O driver,
<BR>
the size of reads and writes was something like 512K, so to write a single
<BR>
8K page of memory to disk took 16 I/Os! That small size made sense back
<BR>
when track sizes were only 2 or 3 times block sizes. But when track sizes
<BR>
grew to 100+ times block sizes, the number of actual I/Os necessary to read
<BR>
or write a single track became a BIG issue. The end result was that drivers
<BR>
were modified and reads and writes chained together to more closely
<BR>
approximate the capabilities of the hardware.  
<BR>
<P>Cutting down on the number of I/Os dramatically reduces code path length at
<BR>
the driver level, and hence increases performance. Not to mention the idea
<BR>
that as one should be able to read or write an entire track at one pass
<BR>
means that one can read/write 100 blocks at a time with one I/O. [And this
<BR>
has nothing to do with on-disk caching, this is all OS level stuff.]
<BR>
<P>One assumes that Linux is not simply copying the old BSD implementation
<BR>
(which is what Ultrix was based on), but did build from current (now 10
<BR>
year old) technology improvements.
<BR>
<P>[The fact that EVERYBODY still talks in units of 512 bytes is one of the
<BR>
most brain dead things in Unix(tm) today. ...talk about the High Priesthood 
<BR>
maintaining job security!][And don't disillusion me and tell me that things
<BR>
REALLY are still implemented based on 512byte records and that's why there
<BR>
are constantly buffer-overrun security holes and the like.]
