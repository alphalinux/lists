<P>
Too many misconceptions to let go by:
<BR>
<P>Building all the software to be big endian is insufficient,
<BR>
I believe.  There may be hardware assumptions make by systems
<BR>
designers as well (motherboard hard-wired to be little-endian)
<BR>
<P>But that's _completely_ irrelevant in this particular case.
<BR>
If you have big-endian data you want to use on a little-endian
<BR>
machine, you do NOT have to do byte swapping on every single
<BR>
access, unless you are actually trying to run a big-endian
<BR>
program (for example, binary translated SPARC or mips executables)
<BR>
Even then, there is a theoretical trick (called &quot;the Martin maneuver&quot;
<BR>
after the guy who thought it up) to avoid a bunch of swapping.
<BR>
<P>All you really have to do is to swap the data at file I/O time
<BR>
if you want to preserve the endian-ness of the data.
<BR>
Some compilers (the compaq fortran compiler) have switches which
<BR>
will make this behavior happen transparently.  The switch for
<BR>
that compiler is '-convert big_endian', and it has other conversion
<BR>
switches for cray data as well.
<BR>
<P>If the problem is that there are big-endian assumptions in the
<BR>
source code, then those would need to be corrected as well.
<BR>
(C code knowing to access byte 3 instead of byte 0 of an int, etc)
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regards,
<BR>
