Subject: Re: rexec problems
<BR>
<P><P>This is looking more and more like an NT/routing problem.  Can you
<BR>
ping through the NT router from affected subnets to the rexec server?
<BR>
If not, this is a routing problem (rather than rexec), and I would
<BR>
suggest trying the following:
<BR>
<P>1)Make sure your NT router has the correct subnet masks for both of
<BR>
its subnets (otherwise RIP won't work).  I've seen this screw NT
<BR>
routing before.
<BR>
<P>-&gt;Those are all set as far as I know because users can telnet through the
<BR>
routing NT server and get to the Linux
<BR>
-&gt;server. most common things work (ie X, telnet, ssh...etc) other than rexec
<BR>
<P><P>2)You could try running gated or similar on the linux hosts to feed
<BR>
rip info to the NT host and make it see the error of its ways.
<BR>
<P>-&gt;I don't think the actual *routing* is a problem, but you never know...
<BR>
everything else works (see above)
<BR>
<P><P>3)Scrapping the NT box and putting a proper router in :)
<BR>
<P>-&gt;yeah I thought about that too... we'll see what happens there =). These
<BR>
particualr computer labs aren't managed by -&gt;the department that I work for,
<BR>
so that's a remote possibility
<BR>
<P>-&gt;I can see if they have another computer that they can dump a couple of
<BR>
100Mbps nic's and make it a linux router to -&gt;see if that helps
<BR>
<P>4)Running &quot;traceroute&quot; and its NT equiv on all hosts to make sure
<BR>
<P>-&gt;traceroutes fine
<BR>
<P>If you can ping, the next stage is to try telnetting to real ports (eg
<BR>
mail and telnet) on the alpha server from affected subnets.  If you
<BR>
have everything closed off, consider opening a port or two just for
<BR>
test purposes until you've got this cracked.
<BR>
<P>-&gt;pinging works fine too... so does telnet, X, etc.... just not rexec
<BR>
-&gt;mail also works
<BR>
<P>Once you can ping, try doing a tcpdump on the server host and port
<BR>
while attempting connections to see what is happening.
<BR>
<P>-&gt; will take a look see at this. I'm at a different school right now so I
<BR>
have to rely on others to do my
<BR>
-&gt;troubleshooting work =)
<BR>
<P><P><P>If that doesn't work, mail me how each of these tests worked and I'll
<BR>
see if I can come up with better suggestions.

<EM>&gt; This isn't a tcp wrappers question, by any chance?  Are the affected

<EM>&gt; subnets pervented by /etc/hosts.allow or /etc/hosts.deny?

<EM>&gt; &gt; here's an interesting bug for ya... hopefully someone knows the answer

to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; =)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I have an alphaserver set up and I am trying to run REXEC connections to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; most of the subnets at my community college can connect to it just fine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; REXEC to it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; unfortunately a few cannot.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I have enabled rexecd, taken out the nologin stuff in /etc/pam.d/rexec
</EM><BR>
as
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; suggested by RedHat.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; here is an example of a subnet that can connect:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; WORKSTATION-&gt;NOVELL ROUTER-&gt;ROUTER-&gt;.....-&gt;ROUTER-&gt;Alphaserver
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; here is an example of a subnet that can't connect:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; WORKSTATION-&gt;WINNT ROUTER-&gt;ROUTER-&gt;..-&gt;ROUTER-&gt;Alphaserver
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; everything has real world IP addresses on them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; any ideas as to why the same user can connect through a novell routed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; instead of an NT RIP system?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the attempt at connection usually just closes, but if you telnet to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; rexec port on the server from an affected subnet (the ones that don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it comes back with &quot;Where are you?&quot; whereas an unaffected subnet just
</EM><BR>
sits
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; there...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; hopefully I haven't confused everyone on the list.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thanks
