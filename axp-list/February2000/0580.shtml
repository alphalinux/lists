All;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had an unfortunate occurance with xscreensaver that I thought deserved a
<BR>
warning.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight, my PC was running unattended, and as always, xscreensaver had
<BR>
kicked in. I was downstairs watching a movie, and my wife was in the Office
<BR>
working on her PC. When she turned around and looked at mine, there was
<BR>
pornographic material on the screen. (I'm very glad my young daughters were
<BR>
not in the room at the time!!!!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked me about it later, and I had no idea where it came from. A
<BR>
little investigation turned up the culprit. There is a module to
<BR>
xscreensaver called &quot;webcollage&quot;. What it does is go out onto the web (on
<BR>
it's own!!!!), and collects &quot;random images&quot; that it finds there, and puts
<BR>
them on the screen!  (does anyone else see the danger here?!?!?).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've disabled this particular hack from my system, and I would suggest
<BR>
that any of you who have a system running in a situation that would be
<BR>
sensitive to this sort of thing do the same! (do you want your boss walking
<BR>
by your PC with that on the screen? How about your 8 year old daughter?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is putting aside the obvious dangers of having your PC &quot;roam the
<BR>
internet&quot; unattended, looking for material to put on the screen!!!!!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll forgo writing a pointed letter to the creators of this hydra. They
<BR>
are on these lists. I hope that they will take heed, and take that hack out
<BR>
of future releases. I personally don't need something like that!
<BR>
