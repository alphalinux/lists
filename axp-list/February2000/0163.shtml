<EM>&gt; &gt; It seems that there is a beta version of RH6.2 up on various ftp sites.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The even have a Alpha AXP version up both in RPM and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ISO image version. So for the dare devils among us...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hmm.. RH 6.1 came out just a little while ago.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm a UNIX geek -- always have been. My first PC (at home) was built
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to run 386BSD; prior to that I used oddball hardware -- low end
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; workstation stuff, and Motorola VME boards with real-time OS's.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, I can't say that I moved to Linux because I wanted to escape
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Microsoft. I moved to Linux because I hoped (and it looks like I'm right)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that it would provide the UNIX dream: compatibility. I wanted to be able
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to run the same software on all my machines without headaches.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Along the way, I gained an appreciation for Linux's staying power. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't like having to wipe my system out every 6 months because RH
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decides to make another release. I like being able to upgrade a few parts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here and there -- want a new kernel's features? Upgrade the kernel, not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the OS.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have a K6-2 downstairs running stock RH 5.2. Nothing is upgraded, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that box performs fine. It runs all the commercial packages that I throw
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at it, too.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I upgrade my OS when I want a) a new libc; b) when I upgrade the hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It seems to me that all of the &quot;new functionality&quot; present in each new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RH release could just as easily be achieved through loads of package
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; updates.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I understand RH needs to release product so that they can make money. More
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power to them. But, sometimes I wonder whether all these constant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distribution upgrades do more harm than good (introduce incompatibilities)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and whether or not they are taking advantage of the consumer's tendancy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (probably due to the mentality of the Windows crowd of &quot;always upgrade
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so that we don't Blue Screen&quot;) to always want the last release of any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given software package -- even when they don't need it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hey.. I'm a geek, and I'm all for lots of toys and tricked out systems ..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but I wonder how people can get work done if they are always upgrading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the OS.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Don't know how you run your systems but I can upgrade a
<BR>
lot of computers in a day. One day every 6 months to a
<BR>
year is not a big deal. I never put valuable data on anything
<BR>
but servers so wiping any one of them clean is no big deal,
<BR>
even the server since I put the OS on it's own disk/partition
<BR>
separate from my own stuff. This of course assumes the distribution
<BR>
is itself stable. Sometimes RH makes me wonder so I wait for
<BR>
other folks to try it and see what they have to say first.
<BR>
I'd say a beta falls into the &quot;wait and see&quot; category.
<BR>
<P>YMMV
