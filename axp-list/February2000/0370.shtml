What is happening on your Miata?  I have loaded (successfully) 5.2, 6.0
<BR>
(+errata) and 6.1.  What problems are you running into?  Granted you may have
<BR>
put them out there already.  I am really buisy lately.  I am still a newbie in
<BR>
many respects (ok, just about all of them) and I have gotten a lot of help
<BR>
from people on the list.  Even on stupid questions where I should have known
<BR>
better.  I don't think that the attitude is all that bad when it comes to
<BR>
helping newbies.  Mostly.
<BR>
Just a quick comment.

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, organization is indeed lacking.  We - both Alpha Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Organization 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  and the community we represent - need more hands and eyes to help out.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Personally, I am exceedingly busy with work that I don't have time 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to code/test kernels/write articles on alphalinux/etc.  Today's an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; exception.. slow day.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I couldn't agree more with Dan on this point. I must admit that I've seen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; quite a few new people posting to axp-list (and others) lately which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; encouraging, but it does still seem to be the same group doing the work. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I know from an alphalinux.org perspective that our biggest constraint is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people. We've got some interesting things that we'd like to do but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it's all a function of manpower.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; At least at the moment, there are at least 2 full time employees at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; LLNL (myself and another) that do nothing but kernel development with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Alpha being our platform of choice.  I would imagine that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other national labs have other people.  Being new to this, I have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looking for a more centrally organized group or repository for Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; related development.  I would like to be able to help keep the Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; port more up to date but I would rather not duplicate effort on that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; front.
