Hi all,
<BR>
<P>I've read the archives of posts here and on deja about RH6.1 and Alpha
<BR>
installs, but nothing that's been posted seems to be close to my problem.
<BR>
<P>I have one of those OnSale AS200 boxes [4/166]. I stuck a ~4gig Micropolis
<BR>
SCSI 3243NT drive and a &quot;cyberdrive&quot; brand 24x SCSI CDR in it, along with
<BR>
24MB of RAM [will be upgrading RAM soon]. I grabbed the latest firmware
<BR>
from digital's ftp site last week and boot via ARC into MILO on a floppy
<BR>
[MILO - forgot the version, but the date is 3/23/99]. Purchased RH 6.1
<BR>
Alpha CDR complete with printed manual, support, etc.
<BR>
<P>I've checked and double checked termination, and all appears ok, but I was
<BR>
having some pretty funky problems with SCSI timeouts. I *think* that is
<BR>
now gone, as I made one last scsi bus change this evening. 
<BR>
<P>I'm doing a KDE or Gnome workstation install, and letting the installer
<BR>
partition my HD, as I would get a &quot;Autopartitioning FAILED&quot; message on the
<BR>
ALT-F2 console when choosing to partition myself. I would like to do a
<BR>
custom install so I can pick a large swap space [i'll have 128MB of RAM in
<BR>
this sucker if I can confirm the hardware is working ok]. 
<BR>
<P>In the boxed version of RH6.1, there is a small supplement to the Alpha
<BR>
docs which state that section 1.2.1 and 1.5.5 aren't nessecary [ie: Disk
<BR>
Druid is capible of creating BSD Disk Labels, and the RH Linux Install
<BR>
Program automaticly installs and configures aboot].
<BR>
<P>As I am booting with ARC, I boot into MILO via floppy and put my 6.1
<BR>
generic disk and RH6.1 CDR in their drives and type: boot fd0:vmlinux.gz
<BR>
root=/dev/scd0
<BR>
<P>In this case, I go with a generic/automatic KDE install. After all the
<BR>
packages are installed, I am asked to pick my monitor. Acording to step
<BR>
1.5.6/1.5.7 I am to first copy MILO to my HD via the mount command.
<BR>
<P>Well, 'mount' produces this:
<BR>
<P>/dev/root / iso9660 rw 0 0
<BR>
/proc /proc proc rw 0 0
<BR>
/dev/ram /tmp ext2 rw 0 0
<BR>
/tmp/sda2 /mnt/sysimage/ ext2 rw 0 0
<BR>
/tmp/sda1 /mnt/sysimage/boot ext2 rw 0 0
<BR>
/proc /mnt/sysimage/proc proc rw 0 0
<BR>
<P>If I type, &quot;/mnt/sysimage/usr/sbin/chroot /mnt&quot; as the docs describe,
<BR>
[well, actually, they state to just type 'chroot /mnt' but 'chroot' isn't
<BR>
in my $PATH apparently] I get:
<BR>
<P>/mnt/sysimage/usr/sbin/chroot: cannot execute /bin/bash: No such file or
<BR>
directory
<BR>
<P>That's cuz /bin/bash is actually located in /mnt/sysimage/bin/bash. I can
<BR>
not create a sym link between the two [error: Operation not permitted], so
<BR>
I don't know how to proceed. If I go through my X setup, the system will
<BR>
reboot [though it can't configure my machine to run X, as it doesn't seem
<BR>
to like my Digital ZLXp-E2 PCI card [i have an 8mb version, where the RH
<BR>
hardware requirements state that the 16MB is supported, but they don't
<BR>
state that the 8mb isn't], but I'm unable to boot or access my hard drive
<BR>
once the reboot has happened; MILO complains that the filesystem on my HD
<BR>
isn't recognized.
<BR>
<P>Note that I've had a lot of SCSI problems, which I'm hoping are not
<BR>
related and are hopefully behind me. If the above problem sounds like a
<BR>
SCSI-related problem, please let me know, as I might still have some SCSI
<BR>
issues to resolve.
<BR>
<P>Hope y'all can enlighten me a bit...
