<P>
<EM>&gt; organized group working on the Linux Alpha kernel.  I have absolutely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no idea who the main contact(s) are for submitting patches or how to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; find patches for the latest kernels in regards to the Alpha platform.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It always seems to lag behind the Intel code by several versions.  In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this regards, I can see where people would want to throw up their arms
</EM><BR>
<P>Right.  Most of my frustration comes from the mainstream developers
<BR>
trying to force x86isms into what should be platform-independent
<BR>
areas of the code; for example, the first few rounds of the 
<BR>
memchr() implementation were hardcoded x86 asm in ./mm/slab.c.
<BR>
Had to code an axp asm equivalent (stuck in ./arch/alpha/lib/, 
<BR>
&nbsp;thank you very much) before the C implementation.  
<BR>
<P>As far as people working on the kernel... here's who I know of over the 
<BR>
past year.. not an official list, just what I can think up right now):
<BR>
Richard Henderson	2.3 fixes
<BR>
Jay Estabrook    	2.3 new arch support
<BR>
Andrea Arcangeli	-aa branch, bigmem, misc. on alpha
<BR>
Me			2.2.x-ac fixes, -sec branch
<BR>
A cast of hundreds? 	Many unattributed bugfixes
<BR>
<P>Don't send Alpha patches to Linus or Alan Cox.  They do not have the 
<BR>
time nor do they care much for the Alpha.  Think we discussed this
<BR>
on the list a couple weeks ago..
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; On the other hand, API seems to be trying real hard to get things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; moving.  They seem like a likely candidate for throwing a little more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resources and/or effort into organizing things better.  Maybe setting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up a sourceforge account for Alpha Linux related development would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good.  Along with encouraging Alpha developers to post their patches
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with a core set of people who maintain the CVS tree.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, organization is indeed lacking.  We - both Alpha Linux Organization 
<BR>
&nbsp;and the community we represent - need more hands and eyes to help out.  
<BR>
Personally, I am exceedingly busy with work that I don't have time 
<BR>
to code/test kernels/write articles on alphalinux/etc.  Today's an 
<BR>
exception.. slow day.
