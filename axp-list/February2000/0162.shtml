<P>Hmm.. RH 6.1 came out just a little while ago. 
<BR>
<P>I'm a UNIX geek -- always have been. My first PC (at home) was built
<BR>
to run 386BSD; prior to that I used oddball hardware -- low end
<BR>
workstation stuff, and Motorola VME boards with real-time OS's.
<BR>
<P>So, I can't say that I moved to Linux because I wanted to escape
<BR>
Microsoft. I moved to Linux because I hoped (and it looks like I'm right)
<BR>
that it would provide the UNIX dream: compatibility. I wanted to be able
<BR>
to run the same software on all my machines without headaches. 
<BR>
<P>Along the way, I gained an appreciation for Linux's staying power. I 
<BR>
don't like having to wipe my system out every 6 months because RH
<BR>
decides to make another release. I like being able to upgrade a few parts
<BR>
here and there -- want a new kernel's features? Upgrade the kernel, not
<BR>
the OS. 
<BR>
<P>I have a K6-2 downstairs running stock RH 5.2. Nothing is upgraded, and
<BR>
that box performs fine. It runs all the commercial packages that I throw
<BR>
at it, too. 
<BR>
<P>I upgrade my OS when I want a) a new libc; b) when I upgrade the hard
<BR>
drive.
<BR>
<P>It seems to me that all of the &quot;new functionality&quot; present in each new
<BR>
RH release could just as easily be achieved through loads of package
<BR>
updates. 
<BR>
<P>I understand RH needs to release product so that they can make money. More
<BR>
power to them. But, sometimes I wonder whether all these constant
<BR>
distribution upgrades do more harm than good (introduce incompatibilities)
<BR>
and whether or not they are taking advantage of the consumer's tendancy
<BR>
(probably due to the mentality of the Windows crowd of &quot;always upgrade
<BR>
so that we don't Blue Screen&quot;) to always want the last release of any
<BR>
given software package -- even when they don't need it. 
<BR>
<P>Hey.. I'm a geek, and I'm all for lots of toys and tricked out systems ..
<BR>
but I wonder how people can get work done if they are always upgrading
<BR>
the OS.
