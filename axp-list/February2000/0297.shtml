Thus said &quot;Jeffery A. White&quot; on Wed, 16 Feb 2000 12:26:36 EST:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I am using top to watch memory use and recently ran the test
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; case twice in a row so that (as far a top is concerned) the memory was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; completely depleted and the job started to swap.
</EM><BR>
<P>What does the second line of 'free' show?  This is what I would use to 
<BR>
judge how much memory is currently allocated---the others have to do 
<BR>
with the memory allocated in buffers which isn't in use and can be 
<BR>
re-used if needed.  If you notice that the number doesn't decrease when 
<BR>
you close your application then I would suspect a memory leak.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is there a better tool than top to monitor memory? Does anybody
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have any idea why the memory is not being de-allocated after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the job completes?
</EM><BR>
<P>top is a good tool, but not for tracking down memory leaks---it's 
<BR>
display can be misleading.  I would try using 'free' instead even 
<BR>
though it isn't the best program either.  I'm sure there must be some 
<BR>
type of tool for detecting memory problems...  Keep looking.
