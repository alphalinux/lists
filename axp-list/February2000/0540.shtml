<P>Andrea recently made a push for discussing/submitting kernel related
<BR>
alpha stuff on linux-alpha (instead of axp-list or /dev/null).  He
<BR>
has gotten increasingly focused on the alpha architecture, AFAICT.
<BR>
Also, don't forget that HPA recently made noise about developing for
<BR>
alpha; I believe someone sent him a machine (or was planning to).
<BR>
<P>not all bad news,
