<P>
Ever since upgrading from the 2.2.5 kernel, my AS 3300 is 
<BR>
crashing frequently. If I do any sort of networking the machine
<BR>
will hang anywhere from immediately to up to 20 or 30 minutes
<BR>
afterwards. In particular, FTP causes an immediate crash
<BR>
with the 2.2.13 kernel. 2.2.14 holds up most of the time but
<BR>
eventually crashes during long downloads. When I say crash
<BR>
I mean it's frozen and I have to reboot. I can't even ping from
<BR>
my other boxes.
<BR>
<P>I had no previous problems with 2.2.5 under RH6.0. It *seems*
<BR>
like it might be a race condition in the networking code somewhere.
<BR>
I'll see if I can get a counter when I reboot and check it against
<BR>
the system.map. Also, my other Alpha's don't share this problem.
<BR>
It's only the AS3300. It's not a hardware fail...the same components
<BR>
work in other boxes and RH6.0/kernel 2.2.5 has no problems on this
<BR>
box.
<BR>
<P>Anyone else with flakey network hangs with 2.2.13/14?
<BR>
