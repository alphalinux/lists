<P>
I have a 533MHz LX board at home. It has an Adaptec SCSI UW controller,
<BR>
a SCSI scanner, a SCSI Toshiba 32X CDROM and a Yamaha SCSI CDRW drive in
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P>I got sick and tired of Windows 2000 being flakey on the system. So I
<BR>
decided to install Linux.
<BR>
<P>I got a Redhat 6.1 disc. I changed my AlphaBIOS over to SRM using the
<BR>
lx164srm.rom file on the Digital ftp site.  Then I tried to boot up 
<BR>
the Redhat disc using the command:
<BR>
<P>boot dka100 -fi /kernels/generic -fl root=/devs/scd0
<BR>
<P>At least I think it was scd0.  Anyway, it would get partway and then 
<BR>
SRM (still on the blue screen) started complaining about the disc not 
<BR>
having 512 byte blocks. Then it halted.
<BR>
<P>Not sure what was up there.
<BR>
<P>So I made a floppy using the MILO image on the digital ftp site. I
<BR>
booted that up through SRM. Then I could boot up the linux CDROM.
<BR>
<P>I figured I could use MILO to boot the CDROM and then use SRM to boot
<BR>
the system.
<BR>
<P>Well, I got to the disk partitioning section on Disk Druid. I created a
<BR>
/ (900MB), a /boot (16MB), a swap file (256MB) and a /usr (the rest).
<BR>
Then I remembered that someone at work told me something about needing 
<BR>
cylinder 0 to be free for a boot record. Well, I couldn't see any 
<BR>
options regarding this. And there was no way to control where the 
<BR>
partitions went on the disc.  So I left the partitions as-is.
<BR>
<P>I set up the rest using the custom installation.
<BR>
<P>When I went to reboot, I set up the SRM like the Redhat 6.1 install PDF
<BR>
had told me to. But SRM complained that block 0 was not bootable! Argh!
<BR>
How did I know that would happen?
<BR>
<P>So, back to MILO I went. That booted up my system just fine.
<BR>
<P>So, my question is, before I get too much stuff installed (already
<BR>
downloaded the new Netscape RPM), how do I set up Linux to boot via SRM.
<BR>
MILO is nice, but it takes a little while to get into it. And since
<BR>
Linux is the only OS on the machine, there is no need for it.
<BR>
<P>Oh, it would also be nice to know why I couldn't boot up the Linux
<BR>
installation CDROM. :)
<BR>
<P>Thanks! 
<BR>
