<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Where can one find up to date info on tools to detect

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; intrusions and possible things to look for that indicate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; something is wrong. I just noticed my wtmp files have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; a gap in them and inetd was restarted and I didn't do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; it on my firewall system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; A URL or anything else helpful would be appreciated.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; (where to start looking in general...)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; CERT didn't look all that useful and I'd like Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; specific info.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; OK, you're dead wrong about cert.  The place to start the postmortems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is usually the classic:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/root_compromise.html">http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/root_compromise.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Compared to the other sites, CERT is not particularly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up to date nor Linux specific.
</EM><BR>
<P>True, but some might argue that it is more accurate and generic.  For
<BR>
example, a lot of sites recently posted a load of rubbish about supposed
<BR>
tcp exploits saying they were linux vulnerabilities (search for
<BR>
&quot;stream.c&quot;), when in fact they were only a problem in FreeBSD.  Cert
<BR>
was accurate.  Similarly the oft-repeated assertion that &quot;users
<BR>
without resource limits can bring down the system&quot;.  Yes they can, so
<BR>
use resource limits.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What I read in the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; section you mentioned is basically common sense that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I already knew to do.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, that's good.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'd say the sites previously 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggested are a better view of what's going on in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux security. Makes you wonder how many sites see 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trouble and don't report it to anyone.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I don't know that linux has that many specific issues, rather
<BR>
than those that relate to packages, which are thus generic unix
<BR>
problems.  The specific linux exploits are usually discussed and
<BR>
resolved on the kernel list long before any so-called security experts
<BR>
find out about them.  You could check for these on
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://kt.linuxcare.com">http://kt.linuxcare.com</A> or
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.lwn.net">http://www.lwn.net</A>
<BR>
<P>...if you don't want to directly subscribe to the kernel list.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I really dislike those security bulletins that say 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Program X has a buffer overflow exploit, please
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contact your OS vendor for a solution.&quot; CERT many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; times just says disable the service until your vendor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; provides a solution. Not what I want to read/hear.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps not what you want to hear, but correct.  You can then go to
<BR>
SuSE, or RedHat or whoever, and get the updates.  You need to get an
<BR>
update from somewhere.  You do check your vendor's site for security
<BR>
updates, don't you?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; YMMV
</EM><BR>
<P>It does.
