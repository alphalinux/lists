Hello,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm running Linux/Alpha on an LX164 board. The problem is that after random
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; uptime the system hangs. The machine is still running and the monitor still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; detects a VGA-signal, however the screen is black and no action can be taken
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anymore.
</EM><BR>
<P>I had the same problems in an LX164, too. Using the up arrow under less in text
<BR>
mode would always cause the machine to hang with a PYXIS machine check, which
<BR>
was 99% of the time not visible because the screen went black, with the cursor
<BR>
in the lower right edge.
<BR>
<P>After trying never to use the up arrow under less for almost a year, I found
<BR>
that the problem was related to the video board. It was a 1Mb s3 trio extendend
<BR>
to 2Mb, but the extension simms were 50ns whereas the original simms were 70ns.
<BR>
Since I've changed the video board, I've never had this problem again.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So far I replaced the power supply, RAM DIMMS, motherboard with an SX164
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; board (21164PC 533mhz), SCSI controller with an Intraserver and 3COM adapter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with a DEC Tulip.
</EM><BR>
Try the video board, then...
<BR>
<P>Hope this helps,
<BR>
<PRE>
