<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Want to run some thoughts and observations by the list:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1. Sun has - repeatedly - stated that while Linux is a gee-thats-neat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    phenomenon, 100% of Sun's research and marketing dollars will go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    to pushing Solaris.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2. In my dealings with engineers at a certain popular distribution house
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    (better not say their name for fear of slander and lawsuits that would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     take even my hat.  red on, please..), I've found the dominant non-x86
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    platform to be ultrasparc; preferred to the point where the employees
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    say that Alpha &quot;sucks&quot; and the port is a waste of time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3. Digipaq is going out of its way to support and contribute to the Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    community, as it has for 5+ years.  They are the only workstation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    vendor to my knowledge which is marketing a 64-bit system specifically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    for Linux hobbyists.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4. Does anyone else see a major disparity between the above items?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    On one hand, you have an openly pro-Linux Compaq; on the other, an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    openly anti-Linux Sun.  Instead of shaking the open hand of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    longtime friend and supporter, we've got folks chasing after the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    grinch and fantasizing about Intel vapourware.  Something is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    desparately wrong in the perception dept., and my pipe dream is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Compaq's marketing and public relations dept. will try to correct it...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    before Alpha goes the way of the Amiga.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 5. Disclaimer - I have absolutely nothing against Sun.  The group I work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    for has over a thousand Sun boxes.  When they work, they're the best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    thing since sliced bread.

</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, isn't this just a numbers game -
<BR>
<P>Think of it this way - how many Suns are there per each Alpha box?
<BR>
Is the ratio 10 to 1 or is it more likely to be 100 to 1?  That in itself
<BR>
could emplain the
<BR>
attitude seen in point #2.  Here also note poiint #5 - you have over 1K Sun
<BR>
boxes.
<BR>
How many Alpha's?
<BR>
<P>It's all really quite sad - Digital and now Compaq seem unwilling or
<BR>
incapable
<BR>
of effectively marketing the Alpha chip.  There is nothing that either of us
<BR>
can do
<BR>
about that - it simply is a fact.  Linux is that only thing out there that
<BR>
can save
<BR>
this chip and its even got problems.  The cost differential for a Linux Alpha
<BR>
<P>system vs. a Linux Intel ( or AMD) is such that it's putting the boxes out of
<BR>
reach
<BR>
for anybody but hardcore number crunchers.  So, it won't exist in volume
<BR>
numbers
<BR>
in the community so fewer developers will work on it so fewer things will run
<BR>
on it
<BR>
so - so - so
<BR>
<P>In the end it spells bad news for the Alpha processor.
<BR>
<P>Unless something changes, like the ability to put together an Alpha system
<BR>
for less than 1K, my guess is that it doesn't have a bright future.
<BR>
<P>My guess is that Alpha's long term future is to server as a great case
<BR>
study about how good or even great technology is killed by bad
<BR>
marketing and management.
