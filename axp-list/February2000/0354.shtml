<EM>&gt; Yeah, organization is indeed lacking.  We - both Alpha Linux Organization 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and the community we represent - need more hands and eyes to help out.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Personally, I am exceedingly busy with work that I don't have time 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to code/test kernels/write articles on alphalinux/etc.  Today's an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exception.. slow day.  
</EM><BR>
<P>I couldn't agree more with Dan on this point. I must admit that I've seen
<BR>
quite a few new people posting to axp-list (and others) lately which is
<BR>
encouraging, but it does still seem to be the same group doing the work. 
<BR>
<P>I know from an alphalinux.org perspective that our biggest constraint is
<BR>
people. We've got some interesting things that we'd like to do but
<BR>
it's all a function of manpower.
