<P>
I've enjoyed reading the lastest couple threads about Linux/Alpha,
<BR>
Compaq, kernel hacking, etc. I'd like to make a few comments.
<BR>
<P>First, the only people in Compaq who read this list are engineers.
<BR>
And, most of these engineers share the some of the same frustrations you do
<BR>
concerning Compaq and Linux/Alpha. We as engineers can not really do much
<BR>
about some things that could change things for the better. It's public
<BR>
knowledge that Compaq uses 'first.last@compaq.com' for mail. If you
<BR>
want to be heard by somebody who may be able to do something... well
<BR>
with a small amount of effort you can figure out the rest...... Maybe
<BR>
you can be the first to tell somebody there is something called an
<BR>
Alpha and it can run Linux. (I hope it's not that bad).
<BR>
<P>Concerning us supporting people with hardware:
<BR>
<P>In the last 6 months or so, my group, not Compaq as whole, have
<BR>
sent
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;1) DS20 to Andrea Arcangeli
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2) DS20 to FreeBSD (forget the person's name)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Alphasystem (not sure of the model) to OpenBSD
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;4) 2 DS10s for RtLinux development
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;5) Fully loaded DS20 to Monty of MySQL fame
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;6) 3 or 4 other DS10s to external partners with whom we are starting
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relationships.
<BR>
<P>This may not sound like alot, but it is since we payed for these
<BR>
systems out of our own group budget. (not forecasted expenses). There
<BR>
have been other seed units sent by other people in Compaq. 
<BR>
<P>We also have access to some Miata class machines for &quot;seed units&quot;. If
<BR>
you'd like to be considered to receive one of these systems (as a
<BR>
loaner or whatever) feel free to send me your proposals or
<BR>
justification describing what Linux/Alpha work you are doing or
<BR>
intend to do, deliverables etc. I'll pass it on and we'll see what
<BR>
happens.
<BR>
<P><P>This isn't really related to the above, but I'm including it anyway.
<BR>
This in response to Linux/Alpha kernel hacking and who's doing
<BR>
what,etc.
<BR>
<P>It appears that Linus takes Alpha specific kernel changes (for 2.3.x)
<BR>
from Richard Henderson. I know Jay and the others here doing kernel
<BR>
work forward the patches to Richard. All Linux 2.2.x changes appear
<BR>
to go to Alan Cox. If you want to contribute and find out what's
<BR>
going on, the linux-kernel list seems to be the best
<BR>
place. linux-alpha is kinda neglected and some things do come to this
<BR>
list. Or use all 3 lists to make sure you get the coverage. Since
<BR>
the group of people doing the Alpha kernel work has been so small,
<BR>
there probably hasn't been much need to &quot;play by the rules&quot; if there
<BR>
are any. I know Andrea recently had some problems because he doesn't
<BR>
monitor axp-list and Richard had posted some things here - but the
<BR>
problems were quickly resolved.
<BR>
<P>That's all for now...
