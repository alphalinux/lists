<P>
With regards to your message at 10:24 AM 2/22/00 -0600, Jason Burrell. 
<BR>
Where you stated:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;A big deal was made when IBM announced their &quot;open&quot; powerpc motherboard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;design. Should/could/would Compaq et al. open up past designs? For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;example, Digital has had design info on the PC164 at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;<A HREF="http://ftp.digital.com/pub/Digital/info/semiconductor/alpha/dsc-software-al">http://ftp.digital.com/pub/Digital/info/semiconductor/alpha/dsc-software-al</A> 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pha.html
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for a long time. An open, current design would speed the creation of an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;inexpensive Alpha box, plus win good will points from &quot;the community.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>

<P><P><P>While I commend this as a noble thought, I doubt it will help much with 
<BR>
cheap Alphas.
<BR>
<P>A few years ago Digital Semiconductor encouraged some companies to build 
<BR>
OEM alpha motherboards, and they did so for a while, but they all quit, 
<BR>
citing the facts that this is difficult to build, small runs make for high 
<BR>
costs, and that the Alpha market in general is not big enough.
<BR>
<P>Samsung has since stepped into the fray, and is CERTAINLY making less 
<BR>
expensive alpha motherboards, but they still will never get them down to 
<BR>
the pricepoint of a Intel or AMD motherboard being made in the hundreds of 
<BR>
thousands, using a chipset that costs under $30 a set.
<BR>
<P>Case in point:
<BR>
New FIC motherboard for Athlon: SK-11.
<BR>
Uses VIA KX133 chipset which costs the Taiwanese manufacturers $29 a set.
<BR>
Board wholesales for $85 to $90 US.
<BR>
<P>It has every bell and whistle you can think of. And they _started_ 
<BR>
production at 15,000 pieces  a WEEK.
<BR>
<P>Right now there are still some very decent Alpha deals out there. Look at 
<BR>
the developer and student bundle being promoted by API and some of the 
<BR>
Alpha dealers at:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.alpha-processor.com/developers/api_developer_form.asp">http://www.alpha-processor.com/developers/api_developer_form.asp</A>
<BR>
<P>$2999 for a full kit 21264/600MHz box is not bad, IMHO.
<BR>
<P>Tell enough people, maybe they will sell a gazillion of these and prices 
<BR>
will drop even more.
<BR>
<P>Let's face it, NOBODY can build this stuff for less than Samsung.
<BR>
