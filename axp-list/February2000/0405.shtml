<EM>&gt; As first thanks for the updating work. I am mainly interested to check the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sable and rawhide archs that are the SMP ones. I see you are not handling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SMP irqs there yet in your patch. Is possible to handle SMP irqs with such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; archs? Could you point out me the sepcs of the two archs? thanks.
</EM><BR>
<P>For rawhide see <A HREF="ftp://ftp.twiddle.net/pub/rth/rawhide.pdf.">ftp://ftp.twiddle.net/pub/rth/rawhide.pdf.</A>  For
<BR>
sable, I have no docs -- you might see if you can get them from
<BR>
Jay Estabrook.
<BR>
<P>Rawhide can most definitely do smp irq handling properly.  I just
<BR>
didn't want to confuse the issue, not being able to test that one.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't understand why you feel more happy in having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; include/asm-alpha/hw_irq.h in the wrong place arch/alpha/kernel/irq_impl.h
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instead of its right location where I moved it in my last patches to make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the irq code architectural clean?
</EM><BR>
<P>MY point is that &lt;asm/hw_irq.h&gt; is _NOT_ architecturally clean.
<BR>
It provides _NOTHING_ needed by generic parts of the kernel. 
<BR>
<P>And in my not so humble opinion, if it isn't needed by anything
<BR>
outside the backend, I shouldn't have to expose it to anything
<BR>
outside of the backend.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And you have still to keep hw_irq.h empty to satisfy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; include/linux/irq.h ;).
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, and that's too bad.  Perhaps we can get this bit o sillyness
<BR>
cleaned up in the x86 port as well.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think you are missing the larger picture that is you'll have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to put hw_irq.h in the right location for sure in the long term
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (irq.c in linux/kernel/) and so your current move to the past
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where such code was just ready for the long term move make no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sense at all.
</EM><BR>
<P>If and when that happens, we can rearrange things.  When I see
<BR>
what's needed for such a generic irq.c, I'll put what's needed
<BR>
in that file.  But even if that happens irq_impl.h will STILL
<BR>
exist, because e.g. init_pyxis_irqs has no business in asm/hw_irq.h.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Please revert the buggy move and resend the patch to Linus. thanks.
</EM><BR>
<P>No.  Please respect my wishes on this and do not send Linus
<BR>
a patch to move it back.
<BR>
<P><P>r~
