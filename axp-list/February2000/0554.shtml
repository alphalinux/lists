<P>
I have no idea if this is related, but as it seems to [me to] be TCP related
<BR>
as well, together with other similarities, I thought I'd give a shout to this
<BR>
forum of experts :-)
<BR>
<P>I have a UDB/Multia running mainly as my Internet gateway. I presently have
<BR>
it with 2.2.14 with IP masquerading and ipchains for firewall as well. I also
<BR>
use pppd (2.3.11) in demand mode (with persist,ktune,idle and holdoff) and a 
<BR>
number of other machines on an ethernet running netscape and/or lynx as 
<BR>
web browsers.
<BR>
<P>It has happened a couple of times while pppd was actively connected to my ISP
<BR>
(modem dialup) and I had logged into the UDB to check how the connection was
<BR>
going that I was suddenly diconnected and netscape crashed. The machine that
<BR>
happened on incidentally is an i386 PC with kernel 2.3.47. All systems stayed
<BR>
up and no reboot was necessary.
<BR>
<P>My question would be if anyone is aware of any problems with using RedHat 6.0
<BR>
Alpha, ipchains and kernel compiled with IP masquearing, which is what seems
<BR>
to be common in these two reports?
<BR>
<P>Thanks for any input,
<BR>

<EM>&gt;Hi all --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Anybody have a clue why after shutting down the browser I could have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;8-12 sockets in LAST_ACK state for a _long_ time?  I found them when I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;realized it was my resending of FIN/ACK's that was keeping my demand PPP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from dropping for upwards of a half hour.  tcpdump &amp; ethereal showed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;my packets going out but no responses, almost like I was shipping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;something slightly mangled.  Doesn't happen on all sites, and not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all the time where it does happen.  Oh, to complicate things, I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;masquerading through my ppp box w/ ipchains, then again through a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stateful F/W-1 box at work before I hit the net.  The browser's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;running on a 2.2.5 box (SX).  Kinda surprises me that the teardowns
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are taking so long.  Has anybody else run into this?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;TIA,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;-ls-
