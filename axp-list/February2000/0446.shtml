<P>
seeing the prospect of having a working SB live in the
<BR>
LX excites me I'm interested in switching firmware.
<BR>
Right now I'm using SRM and when i 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;fwupdate
</EM><BR>
<P>it loads AlphaBIOS
<BR>
and I've got a floppy with milo and linload.exe on it
<BR>
and even a kernel built with use SRM as bootloader
<BR>
turned off
<BR>
about now AlphaBIOS hands it over to milo and milo
<BR>
hangs on 
<BR>
<P>Calibrating Delay Loop 
<BR>
<P>Which I've seen before and it usually happens when
<BR>
you've been messing with settings in AlphaBIOS and
<BR>
you've just updated the environment (F10). This
<BR>
problem was usually rectified (at least in my case) by
<BR>
cold-booting the alpha, after that it would work just
<BR>
fine(till i played with AlphaBIOS settings again)
<BR>
<P>So when I warm or cold boot said alpha it reverts back
<BR>
to SRM(i guess this is a convience feature such that
<BR>
you don't get screwed by firmware that is non-working)
<BR>
<P>but I really want AlphaBIOS to stick because I have
<BR>
faith that milo will work after a reboot. 
<BR>
<P>I have tried AlphaBIOS v 5.70 and 5.66-1
<BR>
and several of the 2.0.X milos
<BR>
<P>any ideas ?
<BR>
thanks 
<BR>
