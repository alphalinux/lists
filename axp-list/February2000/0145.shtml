&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just for the archives, here is my final resolution on this (rather
<BR>
old, but still annoying) problem:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, I gave up on trying to make the 2GB IBM disk work on
<BR>
the internal SCSI controller with the NCR53C8xx drivers in the 2.2 kernel.
<BR>
I took a Segate Barracuta (sp?) that I had on one of the Tekrams and moved
<BR>
it to the integrated controller on the XL. It worked just fine under 2.2.x
<BR>
with the NCR53C8xx driver. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then things got weird when I put the 2GB IBM drive in the place
<BR>
the Segate drive had been, on the Ultra-SCSI narrow Tekram controller.
<BR>
When 2.2.x booted, it detected the 2GB drive as Ultra! That is right, this
<BR>
old, Fast SCSI disk was seen as an Ultra drive. Suffice it to say,
<BR>
attempts to access it were meet with SCSI timeouts. But it had no adverse
<BR>
affects on the scsi bus or the other devices on the bus, provided I left
<BR>
the IBM drive alone. Really weird! Almost as it does not understand its
<BR>
own limitations and wants to run at the channel's maximum bandwidth. Oh
<BR>
well, I think it will find a good home in an Indigo SGI (an duplicate of
<BR>
it runs fine in a Sparc IPX). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to everyone for their help in attempting to solve this
<BR>
problem. TTYL.

<EM>&gt; 	I am having an odd problem with an IBM 2GB Fast SCSI disk on my

<EM>&gt; XL366 alpha. This disk is being used as a system disk and is connected to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the onboard NCR53C810 controller. The system is running Debian 2.1 and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kernel 2.2.7. The disk in question is detected as below:

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; switched to the NCR53C8xx driver for all controllers (as recommended by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the axp-list archives and the kernel help messages). I recompiled a 2.2.7
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kernel with this change and proceeded to boot the sytem. All disks are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; correctly detected on all chains, and this is what the kernel tells me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the disk in question:

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Only, when the system goes to get partition maps for the disks and then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; later load init off of this disk (since it is the system disk), I start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; getting SCSI timeouts on this disk for the onboard scsi chain. It recovers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from the reset, prints the same SCSI speed detection messages, and then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tries again, only to get stuck and reset due to timeouts again, slowly but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; painfully making progress in the boot up. Basically, the system will not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boot.
