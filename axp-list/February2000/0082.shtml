<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I have an Alpha XL266, is it little endian or big endian????

<EM>&gt; &gt;

<EM>&gt; &gt; Little.

<EM>&gt; Partially correct.  The processor itself is bi-endian (supporting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  either) as are MIPS,
</EM><BR>
<P>As are some PowerPC (I think), sparc64, ARM, and SH-3.  These days
<BR>
it's hard to find an architecture that isn't bi-endian.  (Of course,
<BR>
many things that MIPS did 15 years ago are now nearly universal ;-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; but the kernel runs in little mode.
</EM><BR>
<P>Are there any big-endian OSes in common use on axp?  NT is certainly
<BR>
little endian.  I'm pretty sure Tru64 is too.  IIRC, so is OpenVMS
<BR>
(which is weird, since VAX isn't)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decision to make when porting Linux, as - predictably - more software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be coded first on the little-endian x86 arch. 
</EM><BR>
<P>...and it's the native endianness of ext2 which doesn't hurt :-)
