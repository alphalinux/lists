<P>
Want to run some thoughts and observations by the list:
<BR>
<P>1. Sun has - repeatedly - stated that while Linux is a gee-thats-neat
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;phenomenon, 100% of Sun's research and marketing dollars will go 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to pushing Solaris.
<BR>
2. In my dealings with engineers at a certain popular distribution house
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(better not say their name for fear of slander and lawsuits that would
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take even my hat.  red on, please..), I've found the dominant non-x86
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;platform to be ultrasparc; preferred to the point where the employees
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say that Alpha &quot;sucks&quot; and the port is a waste of time. 
<BR>
3. Digipaq is going out of its way to support and contribute to the Linux
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;community, as it has for 5+ years.  They are the only workstation
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vendor to my knowledge which is marketing a 64-bit system specifically
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for Linux hobbyists. 
<BR>
4. Does anyone else see a major disparity between the above items? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one hand, you have an openly pro-Linux Compaq; on the other, an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;openly anti-Linux Sun.  Instead of shaking the open hand of a 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;longtime friend and supporter, we've got folks chasing after the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grinch and fantasizing about Intel vapourware.  Something is 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;desparately wrong in the perception dept., and my pipe dream is that 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compaq's marketing and public relations dept. will try to correct it... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before Alpha goes the way of the Amiga.
<BR>
5. Disclaimer - I have absolutely nothing against Sun.  The group I work
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for has over a thousand Sun boxes.  When they work, they're the best
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing since sliced bread.    
<BR>
