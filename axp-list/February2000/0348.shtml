<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Want to run some thoughts and observations by the list:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1. Sun has - repeatedly - stated that while Linux is a gee-thats-neat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    phenomenon, 100% of Sun's research and marketing dollars will go 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    to pushing Solaris.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2. In my dealings with engineers at a certain popular distribution house
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    (better not say their name for fear of slander and lawsuits that would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     take even my hat.  red on, please..), I've found the dominant non-x86
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    platform to be ultrasparc; preferred to the point where the employees
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    say that Alpha &quot;sucks&quot; and the port is a waste of time. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3. Digipaq is going out of its way to support and contribute to the Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    community, as it has for 5+ years.  They are the only workstation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    vendor to my knowledge which is marketing a 64-bit system specifically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    for Linux hobbyists. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4. Does anyone else see a major disparity between the above items? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    On one hand, you have an openly pro-Linux Compaq; on the other, an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    openly anti-Linux Sun.  Instead of shaking the open hand of a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    longtime friend and supporter, we've got folks chasing after the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    grinch and fantasizing about Intel vapourware.  Something is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    desparately wrong in the perception dept., and my pipe dream is that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Compaq's marketing and public relations dept. will try to correct it... 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    before Alpha goes the way of the Amiga.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 5. Disclaimer - I have absolutely nothing against Sun.  The group I work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    for has over a thousand Sun boxes.  When they work, they're the best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    thing since sliced bread.    
</EM><BR>
<P>IMO one of the problems is there is no single orginization responsible
<BR>
for the kernel, whereas *BSD does. (not wanting to start a Linux vs *BSD
<BR>
war). Linus was given a DS20 and AFAIK it is going unused (correct me
<BR>
if you know otherwise). I also believe Alan Cox was given an Alpha, but
<BR>
he is not very friendly about it (read: ass hole). Instead of throwing
<BR>
Alphas at people who don't give a shit, why not give them to people who
<BR>
*want* them? Groups like the Debian Orginization would benifit from
<BR>
having multiple systems, even if they are just loaners. I think having
<BR>
more support for the FreeBSD people help too. 
<BR>
<P>In the latest issue of LJ is a full page Compaq Alpha Linux ad. This is
<BR>
a good sign, I don't remember DEC ever doing any ads like this. Now if
<BR>
they can keep doing stuff like that I see good things in the future. 
<BR>
<P>While My coding skills are crap (working on it ;-), I would be willing 
<BR>
to help in any way that I can.
<BR>
<P>Attitude towords newbies is pretty shitty on this list! This HAS TO
<BR>
change! IMO we need to split up the traffic a little bit. General Alpha
<BR>
topics should go to axp-software@alphalinux.org or
<BR>
axp-hardware@alphalinux.org since that is what they were created for.
<BR>
This way newbies and everyone else can ask questions on THOSE lists and
<BR>
certian crabby members of THIS list can stay away from newbies. 
<BR>
<P>Another thing that would help is having people provide demo's at LUG's.
<BR>
This is an area I would help in if I had a spare system to take to the
<BR>
local LUG meetings. 
<BR>
<P>A lot of people are tired of the x86 architecture. Creating an Alpha
<BR>
interest in these people should help. Some of these people are moving to
<BR>
Mac and SPARC systems. Not many are coming over to Alpha. Why? Because
<BR>
there are no inexpensive developer/hobbiest systems. Three grand for a
<BR>
DS10 is not acceptable when you can get Ultra SPARCs for less then two
<BR>
and Mac's for less then one. 
<BR>
<P>More articles relating to Alpha magazines/journals would help a lot.
<BR>
Even short articles online would be a boon. I personally plan to write
<BR>
some. If anyone has a subject they would like touched on email me at 
<BR>
rbf@farrer.net and I'll see if I can do it. Just simply copying articles
<BR>
on sites like linux.com and changing the content to reflect Alphas would
<BR>
be very helpful! 
<BR>
<P>Getting people at sites like /. interested would be good. BTW, /. ran on
<BR>
a UDB for the first few years... 
<BR>
<P><P>All IMO,
<BR>
