<EM>&gt; &gt; OK. I'll state the obvious. You've got the kernels configured
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; wrong for your machine. What machine are you trying this on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (its HW config too) and what does your .config look like?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  hmm. i hate it when i miss the obvious. i'll attach the config file for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  review. apologies for the obvious size.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  this is a multia - udb/generic img was required to bring it up initially.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  currently running 2.2.5 -- my reason for attempting 2.2.14 is ipchain and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  dhcp. aparently, there's a bug in ipchain which was fixed in 2.2.11.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  additionally, i'd like to get dhcp working. this will require that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  kernel has the CONFIG_PACKET and CONFIG_FILTER defined. which are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  set in this config file, but i'd love sanity checks there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the config, i think, is set up as alpha_generic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  again, thanks for the help and for anything you can throw at me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't own a Multia/UDB but I can make a couple comments
<BR>
about your config.
<BR>
<P>1. You don't have NCR53C8XX configured. Usually, I thought
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multias used 53c810 chips for SCSI. 
<BR>
2. You've configured QLOGIC_ISP. Do you have a Qlogic card
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the machine?
<BR>
3. No IDE support either. So, you must have a Qlogic card
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or your kernel won't find any disks to access.
<BR>
4. You've configured EISA. Why? Probably not an issue but
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it's unnecessary.
<BR>
5. For RH, if you intend to install, you need CONFIG_ROMFS_FS
<BR>
6. Seems you're missing CONFIG_MSDOS_FS and CONFIG_FAT_FS.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you intend to look at the partition where milo and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;co. live, you'll need one or the other to mount and look
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at it.
<BR>
7. I find networking drivers are easier to work with if
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are modules. You've specified DE4X5 as builtin.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe modules would be handier. Also, if you use DE4X5, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;build DEC_ELCP/DEC_ELCP_OLD. That appears to be tulip's 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name nowadays. Then use /etc/conf.modules to map in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one you want to use. Some cards work only with certain
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drivers so having all 3 handy allows you to experiment.
<BR>
<P>As I said, you need to describe your HW config in order to
<BR>
compare it to your .config. The kernel config process is
<BR>
not automated. You have to specify the correct drivers for
<BR>
your system or the kernel will hang/crash.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, RH does a fair job probing you system
<BR>
at install to setup your HW in a reasonable fashion so it
<BR>
is automated to a certain degree. Once you start building
<BR>
your own kernels, you need knowledge of your HW config.
