<P>} I had a similar problem with a machine a couple years back, after
<BR>
} several months of searching, I found that the memory had a tiny
<BR>
} glitch. Try shifting around your memory modules to see if the behavior
<BR>
} changes, you should be able to move the behavior from the location it
<BR>
} is now to another program on your system, if this happens then your
<BR>
} RAM is at fault.
<BR>
<P>Hmmm...this is interesting. This could be the problem, as when the machin
<BR>
only had 24MB of RAM, I didn't notice the problem [but then I was rarely
<BR>
away from the machine]. I recently put two 64MB SIMMs in, so I'll swap
<BR>
them and see if that helps [the 24MB is out, due to those SIMMs being
<BR>
70ns, and the 128MB being 60ns]. 
<BR>
<P>FWIW, this happens even when the box is at idle [nearly all services
<BR>
disabled, and not in X]. 
<BR>
<P>Could this be sound-related? I know I have a lot of problems due to my
<BR>
sound being foobar'd, but I haven't found the time to recompile the kernel
<BR>
just so I can play an mp3 [amazingly, I can hear my CDs, as the built in
<BR>
sound card has an output that goes directly to the CDR apparently].
<BR>
<P>Thanks for the tip, Joe - you may have saved me months of research. :)
