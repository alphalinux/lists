going to buy it over other 64bit archs because it will run there 32bit

<BR>
<P>This is where em86/fx32 could come in. It appears there are quite a few

people interested in developing this project, but as I understand it, the

code is still quite closed. Isn't fx!32 more advanced than em86 too? One

<P>This is one of the most disappointing areas. At UNSW it looks like we are
<BR>
more likely to get a lab of 30 Ultra Sparcs rather than Alphas (the other
<BR>
contender) due to price. Even if Alphas perform better....
<BR>
<P>It is even more disappointing to see 164 + UX and similar cheaper
<BR>
configurations go EOL when they are reaching very nice pricing.
<BR>
<P>It would also be nice to see SRM open up a bit. Sure there are probably
<BR>
propriety driver code in there, is there any chance we can get a source
<BR>
code release minus these parts (ala mozilla)? I'd like to see a Voodoo
<BR>
running on my multia (for example:). Another for the Alpha open source

community to make into an even better product (an easy way to support
<BR>
older systems that Compaq dont want to support)..
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; All IMO,
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;like wise..
