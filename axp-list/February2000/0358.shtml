<EM>&gt; on a variety of platforms.  
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Heck, I could have told Compaq that Alan has no need for an Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before they shipped it.  I offered him one in late '98, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his response was along the lines of &quot;it would collect dust&quot;. 
</EM><BR>
<P>This is sad, that's two systems that could have been sent to some

useful people!

<P><EM>&gt; Of all the BSD's, FreeBSD has the greatest chance of 'surviving'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in my opinion (no BSD vs. BSD flames, please) and ensuring strong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha support should be one of our concerns.  
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree completely. OpenBSD's focus is on security. NetBSD's is to
<BR>
support every possible arch. FreeBSD's is stability and speed. Of these
<BR>
three FreeBSD has the largest userbase, the most developers, most
<BR>
applications, and the largest userbase. 
<BR>
<P>I have not checked on the status of FreeBSD on Alpha lately, but last
<BR>
time I did it was moving along nicely. FreeBSD on Alpha should be very
<BR>
helpful. Many orginizations use FreeBSD over Linux for the better
<BR>
Network support (no flames please!), especially ISP's. As with us Linux
<BR>
users, some FreeBSD users don't care for the x86 arch. Having a full
<BR>
blown port of FreeBSD to Alpha might give some of those users the needed
<BR>
insentive to switch.  
<BR>
<P>It would be in Compaq's (and our) best interest to have binairy
<BR>
compatibility between Tru64 UNIX, Linux, and FreeBSD. Compaq should put
<BR>
that toword the top of their to do list.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Beg to differ.  I've taken up more than a few bytes explaining simple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; topics in private, and certainly others here have. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I do it all the time, my point was there are certian people who are a
<BR>
little on the jerk side of things. It's not something specific to this
<BR>
group, you'll find one everywhere. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If the penguin64.org site didn't get your blood boiling hot enough, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; visit linux64.org.  Its a redirector to a Tru64 advocacy site.  Heh. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Well at least it is pro Alpha, unlike penguin64.org! 
<BR>
<P><P>IMO,
