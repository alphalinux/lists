Also on the distributions front, Suse, Mandrake and Turbolinux (IIRC) all
<BR>
have relatively recently developed their own
<BR>
axp distributions. Even if RH doesn't care about the alpha port very much,
<BR>
these companies have all recently invested in
<BR>
having their own alpha distros. I think represents a significant
<BR>
investment, one they're certainly unlikely to throw away, or even neglect.

<EM>&gt; Andrea recently made a push for discussing/submitting kernel related
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alpha stuff on linux-alpha (instead of axp-list or /dev/null).  He
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has gotten increasingly focused on the alpha architecture, AFAICT.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, don't forget that HPA recently made noise about developing for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alpha; I believe someone sent him a machine (or was planning to).
