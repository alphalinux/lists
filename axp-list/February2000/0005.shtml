</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I want to set up a Digital Personal Workstation 500au as a dual-boot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machine via SRM (Digital Unix 4.0e and Redhat 6.1). So far I installed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RedHat 6.1 on a second disk and can boot it (using the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generic-up-2.2.12.img kernel ... no other would work).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since the machine has a Powerstorm 4D60T (unsupported under X) - which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I still want to use when booting into Digital Unix - I would like to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; put a cheap PCI graphics card into one of the free PCI slots and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; switch the monitor between these two graphics card depending on the OS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm booting.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I found in the documentation, that there is a 32bit PCI (slot 1) and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; two PCI/ISA slots (2 &amp; 3) still free. Which one should I use? Are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there any restrictions for the PCI graphics card regarding the SRM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; firmware (of course there are restrictions in XFree86)?
</EM><BR>
<P>All the 32-bit slots are behind the builtin bridge, but should work OK.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So far I put a SiS 6326 into any of the free PCI or PCI/ISA busses: it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is visible in SRM (always at bus 01, but in different slots). But if I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attach the monitor to it the console just stays black during booting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (DU or Linux). I did the genvmunix/doconfig/reboot under DU (although
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that shouldn't make any difference for Linux anyway, right?).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I was wondering if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   1. the SiS 6326 is just useless in a PWS 500au
</EM><BR>
<P>It's possible that the BIOS emulator in the SRM console is not up to the
<BR>
task of running the SiS code; you can find this out by removing the 4D60T
<BR>
and leaving only the SiS, or, IIRC, by disabling VGA on the 4D60T via the
<BR>
little DIP switch on the card, then see if SRM comes up on the SiS.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   2. keeping two graphics card in the box won't work
</EM><BR>
<P>Possibly, but it's more probable that the issue is that there are two VGAs
<BR>
competing for the same I/O and memory space ranges. By disabling the VGA on
<BR>
the 4D60T (if indeed that is possible), you will be left with the SiS VGA
<BR>
and the 4D60T accelerator, which do not compete for the same ranges.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   3. some jumper have to be set
</EM><BR>
<P>As above, if there is a VGA disable on the 4D60T.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   4. some SRM variables determine which PCI card/slot is used as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      console
</EM><BR>
<P>Not necessary, nor is it possible, AFAIK. I believe that SRM will choose
<BR>
according to some criteria, if there are multiple instances of cards that
<BR>
don't compete for the same ranges, such as lowest slot number, or fastest
<BR>
card, or some such. But that's not really the issue here.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   5. the console has to be in a specific PCI slot
</EM><BR>
<P>Not as far as I know.
<BR>
<P>The only solution that I can envision is:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SiS (or any other commodity VGA) as the only VGA present
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VGA disabled on the 4D60T so only accelerator is active
<BR>
<P>I believe that SRM console will do the right thing in this instance, ie
<BR>
choose the VGA to do console output on.
<BR>
<P>Critical to the final solution is whether the DU Xserver will function (or
<BR>
can be made to function) with an unknown VGA as the replacement &quot;front-end&quot;
<BR>
and still recognize and work with the 4D60T accelerator back-end. Sorry, I
<BR>
just don't know the asnwer to this question, you'll have to experiment on
<BR>
your box to see.
<BR>
<P>Good luck, and please let the list know if this solution works, or if you
<BR>
find another one.
