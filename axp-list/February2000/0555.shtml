<P>
Need advise on adding a 4th PCI card:
<BR>
In any normal machine - just plug it in.
<BR>
Not so with a PWS433 *#*?*!!!!
<BR>
<P>5 slots (2 64bit)
<BR>
4 cards
<BR>
Qlogic scsi(original), Matrox Millenium, Dlink 100mb ethernet, adaptec 2940U2W(the 4th card)
<BR>
<P>Using SRM- firmware wont allow anything other than the qlogic in a 64 bit slot but then the kernel
<BR>
(2.2.13) hangs at 'probing PCI'
<BR>
Using AlphaBios with this arrangement the firmware refuses to boot - 'illegal PCI config'
<BR>
<P>AlphaBios does however allow the matrox in a 64bit slot and boots (using a previous system on
<BR>
another disk) and accepts all of the the cards.
<BR>
<P>However I had hoped to stay with SRM which is what my current kernel config is set up for.
<BR>
<P>So I thought before I wear out the edge connectors on all the cards which I have tried in 
<BR>
just about all combinations I would ask if a firmware update would help - or have I missed 
<BR>
something simpler? Yes I could remove the old scsi card but it's just annoying being stuck
<BR>
with 2 unusable wasted PCI slots (assuming no one ever writes an XFree86 TGA2 driver which
<BR>
is what originally lived in one of the 64bit slots).
<BR>
<P>The firmware is all original as of about 2.5 years ago.
<BR>
Will an SRM firmware upgrade be more liberal about what can go in  a 64bit slot?
<BR>
and if so - and this is where the nervousness sets in -
<BR>
does the upgrade described for DU on ftp.digital.com/pub/Digital/Alpha/firmware/readmes/dpw433.html
<BR>
work on linux (or does mkbootfirm require DU to run) 
<BR>
and will it -
<BR>
1. trash the current AlphaBios firmware
<BR>
2. leave it untouched
<BR>
3. update both
<BR>
he asks, hoping the answer is not 1.
<BR>
and if I do successfully create the update floppy and boot from it how safe is it
<BR>
- just looking for some reassurance here :-) not wanting to find that due to 
<BR>
some other incompatibility I end up with no firmware at all.
<BR>
<P>Any advise/reassurance gratefully accepted.
<BR>
<P>Mark.
