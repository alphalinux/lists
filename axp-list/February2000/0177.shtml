Hello !
<BR>
One question coming up fairly often is &quot;Which browsers are available on
<BR>
Linux (Alpha) ?&quot;. Since I havn't found a good complete listing, I made one
<BR>
myself, you can find it on
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.itp.uni-hannover.de/~kreutzm/en/lin_browser.html">http://www.itp.uni-hannover.de/~kreutzm/en/lin_browser.html</A>
<BR>
<P><P>The list includes a column indicating download-locations for binaries for
<BR>
Linux/Alpha if available, along with source-locations. For these locations
<BR>
I need your help.
<BR>
<P><P>If you are building one browser or another on a fairly regular basis for
<BR>
Linux/Alpha I would like to include your ftp-location so that interested
<BR>
users find the info more easily. Currently I only considered the &quot;official&quot;
<BR>
download-locations (as mentioned on the homepages of the browsers) and the
<BR>
distribution-specific locations, the latter probably updated rather
<BR>
infrequently (compared to the developement). Especially I remember someone
<BR>
building amaya and mozilla (I didn't find a current one off their homepages).
<BR>
<P>If you know about more browsers, I would be happy to include them.
<BR>
<P>If the description is incomplete or misleading (most ones were taken from
<BR>
the appropriate home pages), please tell me.
<BR>
<P>If you know a &quot;better&quot; download-location or a download location for a
<BR>
specialiced package (debian, suse, redhat) I would like to know that also.
<BR>
<P>Last but not least: If you find errors in my spelling and grammer I will
<BR>
be more than willing to correct them since I am not a native speaker.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for your effort.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helge
<BR>
<P>P.S. I am currently rebuilding (and translating) my homepage, so some 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other pages are still empty/incomplete. This will be fixed within
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the next days.
<BR>
<P><PRE>
