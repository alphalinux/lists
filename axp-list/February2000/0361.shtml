<EM>&gt; Basically 2.2.x with a bag of advanced security and networking features,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first public release.  Its in the 'feature add' stage and may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; flaky.  Public-friendly docs will hopefully be finished by tomorrow.
</EM><BR>
<P>While people are talking about manpower and coding, I'd like
<BR>
to note that virtually no support exists for us programmers without
<BR>
intimate knowledge of the linux kernel. This beast is complicated
<BR>
and difficult to learn for someone who only sporadically has
<BR>
time for non-paid stuff. If there would be some kind of list with
<BR>
tasks like &quot;grab this and this packages, put your code here which
<BR>
must do this and this and send it back to &lt;...&gt;&quot; I'd be able to
<BR>
be MUCH more useful.
<BR>
<P>Otherwise everyone who is new to the kernel is faced with
<BR>
uphill struggle to learn a lot (what is already explored by others,
<BR>
who are now hovewer looking for newcomers for help) before
<BR>
he's going to be useful contributor.
<BR>
<P>I, for one, came from a recently cited here &quot;hardcode number
<BR>
crunching&quot; group who went with Alpha because of its unbeaten
<BR>
FP performance. We know programming and axp specifics
<BR>
down to axp asm, but don't know the kernel (or other packages
<BR>
which need help for that matter) :-(
<BR>
<P>Is there anyone up to such a guiding help ?
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
<P>Andrei
