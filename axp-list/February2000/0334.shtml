Well, I just started developing for Linux Alpha in October when I took
<BR>
a job at LLNL.  So far I've found that there really isn't a centrally
<BR>
organized group working on the Linux Alpha kernel.  I have absolutely
<BR>
no idea who the main contact(s) are for submitting patches or how to
<BR>
find patches for the latest kernels in regards to the Alpha platform.
<BR>
It always seems to lag behind the Intel code by several versions.  In
<BR>
this regards, I can see where people would want to throw up their arms
<BR>
and say &quot;this sucks&quot;.
<BR>
<P>I feel like there needs to be more organization behind keeping current
<BR>
with the latest kernels and hardware variations.  As it is, the
<BR>
linux-alpha mailing list is VERY low volume.  Compaq doesn't seem to
<BR>
know what policy to make in regards to Linux or the Alpha platform in
<BR>
general.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, API seems to be trying real hard to get things
<BR>
moving.  They seem like a likely candidate for throwing a little more
<BR>
resources and/or effort into organizing things better.  Maybe setting
<BR>
up a sourceforge account for Alpha Linux related development would be
<BR>
good.  Along with encouraging Alpha developers to post their patches
<BR>
with a core set of people who maintain the CVS tree.

<EM>&gt; Want to run some thoughts and observations by the list:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1. Sun has - repeatedly - stated that while Linux is a gee-thats-neat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    phenomenon, 100% of Sun's research and marketing dollars will go 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    to pushing Solaris.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2. In my dealings with engineers at a certain popular distribution house
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    (better not say their name for fear of slander and lawsuits that would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     take even my hat.  red on, please..), I've found the dominant non-x86
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    platform to be ultrasparc; preferred to the point where the employees
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    say that Alpha &quot;sucks&quot; and the port is a waste of time. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3. Digipaq is going out of its way to support and contribute to the Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    community, as it has for 5+ years.  They are the only workstation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    vendor to my knowledge which is marketing a 64-bit system specifically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    for Linux hobbyists. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4. Does anyone else see a major disparity between the above items? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    On one hand, you have an openly pro-Linux Compaq; on the other, an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    openly anti-Linux Sun.  Instead of shaking the open hand of a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    longtime friend and supporter, we've got folks chasing after the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    grinch and fantasizing about Intel vapourware.  Something is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    desparately wrong in the perception dept., and my pipe dream is that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Compaq's marketing and public relations dept. will try to correct it... 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    before Alpha goes the way of the Amiga.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 5. Disclaimer - I have absolutely nothing against Sun.  The group I work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    for has over a thousand Sun boxes.  When they work, they're the best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    thing since sliced bread.
