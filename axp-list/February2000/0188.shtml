<P>Hi Kurt.  We seem to be making a habit of this.
<BR>
<P>THIS is a summary of your responses:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; -&gt;server. most common things work (ie X, telnet, ssh...etc) other than rexec
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; -&gt;traceroutes fine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; -&gt;pinging works fine too... so does telnet, X, etc.... just not rexec
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; -&gt;mail also works
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm assuming that, since other hosts can rexec on this box, that
<BR>
you've hupped inetd since the change.  I'm also assuming that there's
<BR>
no policy on the network (eg ports aren't firewalled off, or in use by 
<BR>
NT for something else or something) that would prevent this..
<BR>
<P>You could try to move your rexec to another port and see if you can
<BR>
connect to that.  If you can, your upstream is probably being
<BR>
firewalled per port by the NT host.
<BR>
<P>The only other thing is to do a tcpdump to see if the packets are
<BR>
hitting your linux server.  If the affected hosts are trying to rexec
<BR>
and you see nada on the tcpdump, the problems are upstream.  If you
<BR>
see the packet incoming, but see no response, then your server is
<BR>
swallowing the request for some daft reason, and if you see a request
<BR>
and a response, then the world has gone mad and you should head for
<BR>
the hills ;)
<BR>
<P>As you can tell, I'm getting short of ideas.  This isn't really an axp
<BR>
problem, but I'm posting to the list in the hopes that the generous
<BR>
folks who live here don't mind too much and someone cleverer than I
<BR>
might know the answer.
