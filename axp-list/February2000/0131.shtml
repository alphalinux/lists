&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi everyone,
<BR>
<P>I would to submit some problems I have with my LX164 trying to make network
<BR>
installation.
<BR>
<P>So, I will start by asking if the SCSI+Ethernet card NetStorm 885 is fully
<BR>
supported by the RH install program. I know that the scsi part is working
<BR>
but I have trouble with the ethernet part and I don't know if it comes from
<BR>
the hardware or the install doesn't recognize it.
<BR>
<P>I use my old 21041-based card to network install (with HTTP because I
<BR>
experienced the FTP bug which some of you already report) . Now I'm having
<BR>
trouble with :
<BR>
<P>First : I have script error regarding the &quot;localtime&quot; (I know my hardware
<BR>
clock is still local because I run NT for LightWave !!) I think (I don't
<BR>
know python) that there is a &quot;parantheses&quot; bug on a line regarding some
<BR>
localtime file. If I check that the hardware clock is GMT, no problem at
<BR>
this point.
<BR>
<P>Second : I have trouble with X. My Video card is a Diamond Fire GL 1000 Pro
<BR>
8Mo. The correct XServer (3D-Labs) is used. But then it refuses to lanch X
<BR>
for final testing with any combination of resolution color/depth even if I
<BR>
manually configure it.
<BR>
<P>Finally : I have trouble with password. I finally get an install to complete
<BR>
(after 6 hours and the HTTP server is the server is next to my box!!) but
<BR>
with some errors that I wasn't enable to read.
<BR>
I reboot my box and when asking for login : I tape any login (root and the
<BR>
user I create during install). After I type &quot;enter&quot; I've got a message
<BR>
saying &quot;bad login or password&quot; (I can't type any password).
<BR>
<EM>&gt;From advice of a friend of mine who is far more linux-aware than me, I
</EM><BR>
reinstall one more time. And during install, I got some thing like that (I
<BR>
think because the error message was cut by a window for debugging python
<BR>
script): &quot;/usr/bin/passwd : can't used shared object ... No such file or
<BR>
directory. &quot;
<BR>
<P>I hope that I'm precise enought to get help.
<BR>
<P>And thanks for anyone, who could help me with any of these problems.
<BR>
<P>Bye, Mathieu.
<BR>
<PRE>
