<P>
preface: i am the eternal newbie, i have been playing with RH-axp since ver
<BR>
4.0
<BR>
nothing major, just playing. i have subscribed to the list off and on as my
<BR>
time and schedule permits.
<BR>
i just installed a fresh copy of RH6.1, applied the update rpms, did a make
<BR>
menuconfig to compile a new kernel to include ip-masq, firewall,
<BR>
ip-forwarding etc...i am building a ip-chains/masq/router box (i spluged for
<BR>
dsl). i have a bone stock 166 udb w/64mb, original ncr53cx810 scsi
<BR>
controller, the on-board ethernet and an additional intel etherexpress pro
<BR>
10/100 nic (it was free, so no intelicide comments please ;-).)
<BR>
stock kernel 2.2.13-0.9 and sources. no kernel patches of any kind
<BR>
<P>i have 2 issues: nics that change id's and a few unresolved
<BR>
dependancies/symbols
<BR>
below i will try to include the pertinent info, but let me know if there is
<BR>
something that should also post/fwd
<BR>
<P>NICS
<BR>
kernel compile #1: stock .config and only added ip-fwd &amp; masq options on.
<BR>
copiled ok, no errors, a few random warnings.  after compile the ip-fwd,
<BR>
masq etc worked. cool i thought. i will strip more un-needed stuff out.
<BR>
scripted a 'buildkrnl' script for after make menuconfig. (simply the
<BR>
commands i used before: make dep, make clean, make make boot, make modules,
<BR>
make modules_install)
<BR>
<P>kernel compile #2: turned off a bunch of stuff that i know i do not need:
<BR>
extranious code pages, 3coms, raid, aha*'s, buslogic, etc..under networking
<BR>
disabled ipx, appletalk,
<BR>
added oss-mss-530-9-3
<BR>
no errors on booting the new kernel. just the following warnings:
<BR>
<P>Remounting root filesystem in read-write mode              [  OK  ]
<BR>
Finding module dependencies /lib/modules/2.2.13-0.9/scsi/ide-scsi.o:
<BR>
unresolved
<BR>
symbol(s)
<BR>
/lib/modules/2.2.13-0.9/block/ide-tape.o: unresolved symbol(s)
<BR>
/lib/modules/2.2.13-0.9/block/ide-floppy.o: unresolved symbol(s)
<BR>
/lib/modules/2.2.13-0.9/misc/ipx.o: unresolved symbol(s)
<BR>
/lib/modules/2.2.13-0.9/misc/iph5526.o: unresolved symbol(s)
<BR>
/lib/modules/2.2.13-0.9/misc/appletalk.o: unresolved symbol(s)
<BR>
<P>these didn;t seem to be too concerning.
<BR>
<P>ip-fwd, masq, etc do not work, i used the saved rules and reloaded the
<BR>
ip-chains rules. no errors reported. still wouldn;t work.
<BR>
<P>i spent a couple of days thinking that i misconfigured things, until finally
<BR>
payed attention to netstat -rn and realized that the nic were wacked out..
<BR>
they really did switch eth0 &amp; eth1! i change my route and ip-chains to match
<BR>
and everything works.
<BR>
nic     old (generic) krn     new (noname) krnl
<BR>
de4x5     eth0                 eth1
<BR>
eepro     eth1                 eth0
<BR>
<P>linuxconf reported the same thing, i changed the driver on each card to the
<BR>
'other' thinking that the kernel was confused. things still would not work.
<BR>
after putting the eth/driver assignments back to original, booting the
<BR>
original kernel it reports that in fact de4x5 is eth0, eepro is eth1. i can
<BR>
ping and get correct response on each interface. boot kernel #1, things are
<BR>
ok, ip-fwd/masq works and restored rules are right.
<BR>
booting kernel #2 however same warnings from above, and ip-fwd/masq is just
<BR>
fubar'd same reversal of nic &amp; eth#
<BR>
<P><P>anyone have any ideas how this could happen. this is most disconcerting.
<BR>
could this be realted to the on-board microsoft sound system?
<BR>
<P>Modules: i tried to search the docs for the dependancy errors but no luck.
<BR>
since everything seems to be working, i am not too worried but it just bugs
<BR>
me.
<BR>
<P>thanks in advance
