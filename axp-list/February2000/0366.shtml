<P>
I've been searching online archives for a straight answer and haven't found
<BR>
one, so I'll ask a (probably) stupid question:
<BR>
<P>I've just acquired a DEC Personal Workstation 433a with 128MB of RAM and an
<BR>
Adaptec 2940UW SCSI card (and two 2Gb SCSI drives). I've upgraded the
<BR>
firmware to the latest version and switched from AlphaBIOS to SRM. My
<BR>
reading indicates a lot of people have a lot of problems because the 2940UW
<BR>
is not recognized by SRM.
<BR>
<P>[N.B. I've got an older PW433a that should exhibit the Pyxis chip problem.
<BR>
That's not what this e-mail is about. I'm not experiencing any errors with
<BR>
the current PCI cards and don't plan on adding any more.]
<BR>
<P>Here [at last] is the question: &quot;Can I actually get this thing to work?&quot; or
<BR>
in other words: &quot;Do I have a lovely DEC doorstop here?&quot;
<BR>
<P>I don't need to know exactly *how* to get it to work: I can figure that out.
<BR>
I just want to know if I'm wasting $79.95 buying RedHat Deluxe 6.1 for a
<BR>
machine that will never be able to run it.
<BR>
<P>My reading tells me I might be able to boot from an IDE hard drive (with the
<BR>
latest version of SRM). I could pop an IDE drive in it, would that work (I
<BR>
know I can boot from floppy and IDE CD-ROM)? I could yank the SCSI system
<BR>
altogether (for use in an Intel PC) or use it as non-bootable data space.
<BR>
<P>I've also read that IDE performance might not be great (DMA not
<BR>
implemented?). Is this true?
<BR>
<P>I know there are a lot of these machine out there. How have some of you
<BR>
handled this.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for your patience with this tired line of questioning.
<BR>
