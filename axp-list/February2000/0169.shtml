Steve,
<BR>
<P>Normally you want the DOS/FAT partition to be the first partition.  Various reasons for this, such as the bootloaders normally use part of the first cylinder and some of the filesystems do not play well with some bootloaders, some versions of DOS/FAT/console code have issues with partitions in the higher cylinder/sectors of some of the bigger hard drives, its a semi-standard, it makes it easier to switch bootloaders, etc.  
<BR>
<P>I am not as familar with ARC.  All my systems use SRM.  IF you do not have a problem with the console seeing the partition and you can format it as DOS/FAT with the system files you should be alright.  Copy MILO onto this partition.  Set up the console to boot this partition.  Test boot to MILO without parameters and boot to linux manually.  Then shut down and set up the parameters.  Others here can help with the details or you can check out www.alphalinux.org there should be some references there to the neccessary details for UDB ARC configuration or you can check the archives of this list as it has been discussed before in both places.

Hope this helps.

<P>OK, a little update.  I just remembered that arcinst.exe was on my NT
<BR>
Server CDROM (been doing NT since 3.5 on the AXP), so I used that to
<BR>
create a 5mb FAT partition on partiton3.  So my disk now looks like
<BR>
<P>part1- 444mb /
<BR>
part2- 64mb swap
<BR>
part3- 5mb FAT and empty
<BR>
<P>So I guess I need some guidance on getting the appropriate MILO and
<BR>
linload stuph on part3 and telling ARC to run that to get things booted on
<BR>
part1.  Thanks again if you kids can help.
<BR>
