<P>
<EM>&gt; In the end it spells bad news for the Alpha processor.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unless something changes, like the ability to put together an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for less than 1K, my guess is that it doesn't have a bright future.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My guess is that Alpha's long term future is to server as a great case
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; study about how good or even great technology is killed by bad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; marketing and management.
</EM><BR>
<P>These comments are reminiscent of the ones made on the AlphaNT list right
<BR>
before the big crash back in August.  This has always been the problem.
<BR>
Where did the RX board ever go, even with all the AMD chips, the UP1000 is
<BR>
still out of regular folks reach.  I know if I can't even afford to upgrade
<BR>
my AlphaStation 200 4/233 to a faster Alpha processor (boy do i want to),
<BR>
some regular joe out there surely isn't going to spend 3K on a system when
<BR>
they could buy a 500Mhz comparable Celeron system for half that, and it runs
<BR>
99% of all the apps out there straight out of the box (i.e. no begging for a
<BR>
port like Alpha folks typically have to do).
