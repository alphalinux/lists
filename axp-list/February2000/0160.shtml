<P>
here's an interesting bug for ya... hopefully someone knows the answer to it
<BR>
=)
<BR>
<P>I have an alphaserver set up and I am trying to run REXEC connections to it.
<BR>
most of the subnets at my community college can connect to it just fine and
<BR>
REXEC to it.
<BR>
<P>unfortunately a few cannot.
<BR>
I have enabled rexecd, taken out the nologin stuff in /etc/pam.d/rexec as
<BR>
suggested by RedHat.
<BR>
<P>here is an example of a subnet that can connect:
<BR>
<P>WORKSTATION-&gt;NOVELL ROUTER-&gt;ROUTER-&gt;.....-&gt;ROUTER-&gt;Alphaserver
<BR>
<P>here is an example of a subnet that can't connect:
<BR>
<P>WORKSTATION-&gt;WINNT ROUTER-&gt;ROUTER-&gt;..-&gt;ROUTER-&gt;Alphaserver
<BR>
<P>everything has real world IP addresses on them.
<BR>
<P>any ideas as to why the same user can connect through a novell routed system
<BR>
instead of an NT RIP system?
<BR>
the attempt at connection usually just closes, but if you telnet to the
<BR>
rexec port on the server from an affected subnet (the ones that don't work)
<BR>
it comes back with &quot;Where are you?&quot; whereas an unaffected subnet just sits
<BR>
there...
<BR>
hopefully I haven't confused everyone on the list.
<BR>
thanks
<BR>

The Alphaserver is running RH6.1
