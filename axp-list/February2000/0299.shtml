Make sure you have an *active* SCSI terminator. I've had problems
<BR>
several years ago with a passive terminator and the system hung
<BR>
like you described.

Subject: strange hardware problem with alpha oem-board-based server
<BR>
<P><P>Hi,
<BR>
<P>I'm running Linux/Alpha on an LX164 board. The problem is that after random
<BR>
uptime the system hangs. The machine is still running and the monitor still
<BR>
detects a VGA-signal, however the screen is black and no action can be taken
<BR>
anymore.
<BR>
This problem started about a year ago, that time I thought it was a unique
<BR>
hang and forgot about it but after 3 months or so the same happened again.
<BR>
This problem reappeared again and again, the uptimes were continually
<BR>
decreasing, currently it can't even be up for more than a day...
<BR>
<P>I'm quite sure it's not a software related problem because this also
<BR>
happened when the server was idle and no deamon was running. Moreover I
<BR>
resetup the system multiple times, with different kernels (currently
<BR>
running 2.2.13)...
<BR>
In fact I came to the conclusion that it's hardware related.
<BR>
<P>The initial hardware configuration was as follows:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LX164 Alpha motherboard, 21164a 600mhz
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;512 MB ECC RAM (4 DIMMS)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adaptec 2940 Ultra2 SCSI controller
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IBM 4,5GB Ultra2 LVD SCSI HD
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3COM network adapter
<BR>
<P>I also want to point out that it's not (at least 99%) a temperature /
<BR>
overheating problem, I've checked the cooling fans and monitored the
<BR>
temperature, it's fine...
<BR>
So far I replaced the power supply, RAM DIMMS, motherboard with an SX164
<BR>
board (21164PC 533mhz), SCSI controller with an Intraserver and 3COM adapter
<BR>
with a DEC Tulip.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately nothing helped! Interesting was that after I changed the
<BR>
Adaptec with the Intraserver controller, the uptime dramatically decreased.
<BR>
However I don't know for sure whether the Intraserver controller caused this
<BR>
or not...
<BR>
<P>The thing is that when it 'hangs' (no action possibly, not reachable via
<BR>
network) there's still a VGA signal. If the CPU would stop due to
<BR>
overheating or the power supply would cause this then there would be no VGA
<BR>
signal...
<BR>
So I still think it has to do with the storage hardware. I'm pretty sure the
<BR>
Intraserver is ok, also the HD should be. After a reboot everything works
<BR>
fine again...
<BR>
<P>Could the reason for this be a defect or bad SCSI cable? This is what I
<BR>
haven't changed yet, it may also be the SCSI terminator placed at the end of
<BR>
the device chain. Would it be possible that one of those items causes this?
<BR>
<P>I'd more than appreciate any help concerning this subject. Thank you all in
<BR>
advance!
<BR>
<P><P>cheers,
<BR>
