<EM>&gt; war). Linus was given a DS20 and AFAIK it is going unused (correct me
</EM><BR>
It sits in his garage collecting termites last I heard.  
<BR>
Both Alan and Linus rely on others in the community to test pre-patches
<BR>
on a variety of platforms.  
<BR>
<P>If any of you guys want to see what I've been coding at, grab

Basically 2.2.x with a bag of advanced security and networking features,
<BR>
first public release.  Its in the 'feature add' stage and may be 
<BR>
flaky.  Public-friendly docs will hopefully be finished by tomorrow. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; if you know otherwise). I also believe Alan Cox was given an Alpha, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he is not very friendly about it (read: ass hole). Instead of throwing
</EM><BR>
Heck, I could have told Compaq that Alan has no need for an Alpha
<BR>
before they shipped it.  I offered him one in late '98, and
<BR>
his response was along the lines of &quot;it would collect dust&quot;. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; having multiple systems, even if they are just loaners. I think having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more support for the FreeBSD people help too. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Ron, I would bet you have read my mail if I were a betting man.  
<BR>
Of all the BSD's, FreeBSD has the greatest chance of 'surviving'
<BR>
in my opinion (no BSD vs. BSD flames, please) and ensuring strong
<BR>
Alpha support should be one of our concerns.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Attitude towords newbies is pretty shitty on this list! This HAS TO
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; change! IMO we need to split up the traffic a little bit. General Alpha
</EM><BR>
Beg to differ.  I've taken up more than a few bytes explaining simple
<BR>
topics in private, and certainly others here have. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; More articles relating to Alpha magazines/journals would help a lot.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even short articles online would be a boon. I personally plan to write
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some. If anyone has a subject they would like touched on email me at 
</EM><BR>
We've been throwing that around at ALO, and I'd love to field an 
<BR>
op-ed section on our website.
<BR>
<P>If the penguin64.org site didn't get your blood boiling hot enough, 
<BR>
visit linux64.org.  Its a redirector to a Tru64 advocacy site.  Heh.
