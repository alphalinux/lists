<EM>&gt; &gt; Yeah, organization is indeed lacking.  We - both Alpha Linux Organization 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  and the community we represent - need more hands and eyes to help out.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Personally, I am exceedingly busy with work that I don't have time 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to code/test kernels/write articles on alphalinux/etc.  Today's an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; exception.. slow day.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I couldn't agree more with Dan on this point. I must admit that I've seen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quite a few new people posting to axp-list (and others) lately which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; encouraging, but it does still seem to be the same group doing the work. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I know from an alphalinux.org perspective that our biggest constraint is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people. We've got some interesting things that we'd like to do but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's all a function of manpower.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>At least at the moment, there are at least 2 full time employees at
<BR>
LLNL (myself and another) that do nothing but kernel development with
<BR>
the Alpha being our platform of choice.  I would imagine that the
<BR>
other national labs have other people.  Being new to this, I have been
<BR>
looking for a more centrally organized group or repository for Linux
<BR>
related development.  I would like to be able to help keep the Alpha
<BR>
port more up to date but I would rather not duplicate effort on that
<BR>
front.
