<P>
I'm taking on a project to design a secure database backed website for a
<BR>
wholesale grocer with a large inventory and many, many daily transactions.
<BR>
I'd like to use MySQL on my Alpha Linux box to prototype the project, but I
<BR>
can't find MySQL for Alpha Linux. The project will eventually be moved to
<BR>
Linux for Intel due to budgetary and other reasons, but I already have this
<BR>
AlphaStation that I'd like to use for prototyping the design.
<BR>
<P>Does anyone know of any binaries or RPMs for MySQL that are compiled for
<BR>
Alpha Linux? I've looked around and can't seem to locate any. I know that I
<BR>
could get the source, the proper libs, etc., etc. and build it, but I don't
<BR>
usually have much luck doing that with apps that are not developed
<BR>
specifically for Alpha Linux.
<BR>
<P>I'd like to use MySQL, but I suppose I will consider other SQL databases
<BR>
for Alpha Linux.
<BR>
<P>If I can't find a stable build of this app for Alpha Linux, I suppose I may
<BR>
consider selling my DEC AlphaStation 200 4/233. It's got 32mb RAM, 4gb SCSI
<BR>
hard drive, SCSI CD-ROM drive, TGA video card w/ 8mb VRAM... Anyone
<BR>
interested? Serious inquiries, please reply to this email.
<BR>
<P>Thanks
<BR>
Bruce
