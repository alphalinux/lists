I took some good advice and just waited for sendmail to time out which
<BR>
took about 10 minutes and then waited like 10 more minutes for it to
<BR>
figure out I didn't have a host name that xdm wanted that i entered and
<BR>
so finally after 25 mins of waiting I'm back in my box. I'm definitly
<BR>
going to attempt this technique again and heavly document it and post it
<BR>
on ALO. Thank you all for your help.

<EM>&gt; Try editting the files again, and running sync before you reboot.
