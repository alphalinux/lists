<P>
I may have the ideal way of introducing Linux (most probably on alpha) into
<BR>
work if there is a good Linux solution to the following problem. Like most
<BR>
organizations we have a squid proxy server which (perhaps unlike most)
<BR>
_must_ be used by all our users to access WWW content outside of the
<BR>
University. All browsers are configured to use this proxy server (which
<BR>
runs squid on top of Digital Unix).
<BR>
<P>Naturally this is a single point of failure which just happened :-) To add
<BR>
excitement, the two members of staff who could have fixed this relatively
<BR>
easily (someone kicked out the SCSI cable) were on a training course and as
<BR>
a result there was no web access for more than 12 hours (local pages
<BR>
weren't really accessible as browsers tried to contact the squid server).
<BR>
<P>This problem can be solved by purchasing a new Digital Unix box and a Cisco
<BR>
IP redirector for an all up cost of lots (say AUD$40K). Now I seem to
<BR>
recall that this can be done totally in software with a linux box and if
<BR>
this is the case we can probably do it for far less (AUD$6K perhaps). Has
<BR>
anyone got any pointers or experience with this sort of thing? It would be
<BR>
especially neat if Linux/Alpha could be used (we'd save more money on
<BR>
maintenance on the current box and could buy the other one out of savings).
<BR>
This should be the thin end of the wedge...
