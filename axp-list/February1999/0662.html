When escaping from the RedHat install, your hard drive is
<BR>
not necessarily mounted.  You might have been editing the
<BR>
files in the ramdisk filesystem which of course get forgotten
<BR>
when you reboot.  If this is the case, do the same steps you did
<BR>
before, but use mount(1) to mount your harddisk then edit the
<BR>
files there.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good Luck,
<BR>

<P>PS. This happened to me over the weekend.  My system clock
<BR>
had been set to 2019 and lots of symbolic links had really bogus
<BR>
timestamps.  I did a global find to locate all these links in the
<BR>
future and wrote a script to remove and recreate the links.  It
<BR>
turns out after removing the symbolic link to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/lib/ld-linux.so.2
<BR>
<P>that almost no programs (like rm, ln, ls) will run anymore.
<BR>
I did the same stuff you are doing to recover.  Aren't the
<BR>
programs in /sbin supposed to be compiled without shared
<BR>
libraries to make recovery easier?

<EM>&gt; ctrl+alt+del to reboot. It starts to boot and get's to the starting services

<EM>&gt; then opened them again to see if they were ok. I verified with mount that

<EM>&gt; the drive was rw. I chaged th ip #'s and the inittab to 3 and I find the

<EM>&gt; deleted/modified had reappered? This sort of amusing but anoying at the same
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt; Subject: I can't get into my system!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Funny thing. I brough my Alpha box to school to test it as an application
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and X server on the network there for 25 win 98 machines
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;using xclients. I had to change my ip stuff and changed my inittab to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;runlevel 5 to do this. So I forgot to reset my old settings for my box and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;brought it home and then to my surprise I find out that it hangs on boot.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Specificly it hangs on &quot;starting sendmail&quot; and then I'm stuck. I searched
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the archives and found that neat trick to get into the RH setup and use the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;ash shell to do stuff. So I did that and found the files
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I wanted to modify and proceeded to use emacs. There was no emacs :( So I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;tried vi. I popped open a file, fumbled around a little and finaly finished
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;up and to my embarisment I found that I did not know the command to save
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;file. help was not available and using quit told me I had to use ! to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;override something.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;So my question is could some kind soul please tell me how to save a file in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;vi? Thank you.
