<P>
I have recently been working on some benchmarks comparing the 164's(LX
<BR>
motherboard at 533) and the new 264, thanks to one of the vendors on the
<BR>
list and
<BR>
have not found the speed up I expected going to the 264.  So I thought
<BR>
I'd toss out
<BR>
a few questions for the gurus.
<BR>
<P>First some background, the code is a computational fluid dynamics code
<BR>
and was
<BR>
compiled under a DEC Unix box, I believe an older 3?? mhz box if that
<BR>
matters.
<BR>
Anyway, after compiling I've moved the code to several linux boxes and
<BR>
tested it,
<BR>
along with a comparison on a SGI Octane that we routinely run on.  Here
<BR>
are
<BR>
the results:
<BR>
<P>Octane:225mhz                      37 min. 47 sec.
<BR>
Alpha164:533mhz(-O4)       46 min. 38 sec.
<BR>
Alpha164:533mhz (-O5)      39 min. 03 sec.
<BR>
Alpha 264 500 mhz               23 min. 40 sec.
<BR>
<P>The -O4/-O5 is the optimization level under DEC fortran.  The code run
<BR>
on the
<BR>
264 was the -O5 compiled version.
<BR>
<P>I've seen SpecFP95 numbers that indicate a factor of 3 speed up(for what
<BR>
<P>a standardized benchmark means) so I have a couple of questions.
<BR>
<P>1)  Is there a newer DEC fortran that 'knows' about the 264?  Would this
<BR>
possibly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;improve the results?
<BR>
<P>2)  Has anyone else done benchmarks of their own code?  How did they
<BR>
turn out?
<BR>
<P>3)  We've tweaked with the options for compiling on SGI's, but this was
<BR>
a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quick and dirty compile under DEC Unix, i.e. use one of the global
<BR>
-O
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flags and go, does anyone have any suggestions for particular flags
<BR>
to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;look at under DEC's fortran that may help it on the alpha cpu's and
<BR>
on the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;264 in particular.
<BR>
<P>I'm very pleased with the 164 performance compared to the Octane,
<BR>
considering
<BR>
that it is probably less than 20% the cost, and on a cost comparison the
<BR>
264 is
<BR>
twice as fast for what is probably similar prices so I'm pretty happy
<BR>
with that.
<BR>
I was just expecting a little more.
<BR>
<P>Any information would be greatly appreciatted.
<BR>
Thanks,
<BR>
Todd
