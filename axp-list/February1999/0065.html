&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry to disappoint you, but that's old news Peter :-)

<EM>&gt; One of friends had brought in an OS to show me, It was on a floppy. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thought it was Linux but I wasn't even close. He put the disk in and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rebooted and in 3 minutes there was a full X windows environment with a
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably not X11 - Photon or whatever they call the proprietary 
<BR>
windowing system.  I think they sell a port of X11 to QNX for around 
<BR>
$800 or so.  
<BR>
<EM>&gt; web browser and ip configured. It's damn fast too on these P200's. It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; called QNX. It's  a real time OS that uses a microkernel and uses all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kinds of just cool stuff. It's closed source and runs on Intels only at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the moment but it was sooo cool I just had to share it. Check it out at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; www.qnx.com 
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really neat.  First developed for embedded 6809 systems as I 
<BR>
recall, back in the early 80's.  Personally, the coolness factor of 
<BR>
QNX won't change this hacker's mind about not shelling out $1k for it.
