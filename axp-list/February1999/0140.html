<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Ok.. I just looked at the specs for the 21264... why is it still a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;.35micron chip? Almost everyone has gone below that.. and towards the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;.18micron.... can you imagine the kind of heat a 0.35 micron chip can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;generate at 600Mhz? I don't get it... does Samsung lack the technology?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Can they not license it from someone like AMD? Or are they just slow in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;upgrading their fabs?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 0.25um has just been recently introduced  in the product industry and is in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so called 'ramp up' phase.  0.18 still needs at least 2 years to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there...although everybody is pushing hard...
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm.  Samsung is already using 0.18 um for RAM (e.g. 1-Gbit DRAM)- in samples.
<BR>
(<A HREF="http://www.usa.samsungsemi.com/about/press/1gsdramoem98.htm">http://www.usa.samsungsemi.com/about/press/1gsdramoem98.htm</A>)  Seems that
<BR>
technology is nearing, or perhaps in, 'ramp up' phase...
<BR>
<P>But also, the 21264 was designed for 0.35 (since it was supposed to be available
<BR>
last year).  There's an argument that goes something like, &quot;If it's the fastest in
<BR>
the world at 0.35, why not get some extra use of those fabs and make a lot of
<BR>
money in the process?&quot;  I've heard that along these lines, Intel debuts products
<BR>
like the Pentium at slower speeds than the fastest they're capable of, and waits
<BR>
to get the yield up in higher-speed chips before releasing them.  There's some
<BR>
profit-taking involved in such scheduling- make money on the chips that don't test
<BR>
quite so fast before destroying this &quot;low-end&quot; market with faster chips.  It seems
<BR>
like a necessary condition for this to work is to be the performance leader in
<BR>
your market segment, which Pentium sort of was, and which 21264 definitely is.
<BR>
<P>I don't know if such thinking plays any part in Samsung/Compaq's decisions.  In
<BR>
one sense, it might make a consumer feel cheated, that we're not getting the best
<BR>
price/performance as soon as it's ready.  On the other hand, the level of
<BR>
investment necessary to make 21264 happen, especially with all of the delays, had
<BR>
to be enormous, so such behavior is very understandable.
<BR>
<P>Let me emphasize again that I have no idea whether any of this is pertinent, and
<BR>
please correct me if I'm off-base on any of it.  The economics involved have
<BR>
intrigued me for a long time. :-)
