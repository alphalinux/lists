<EM>&gt; It was just a idea I had while trying to go to sleep.... Maybe RH should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; look into making a program to upgrade a RH system without rebooting for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; future version some day?!? I mean everything except the kernel (of course)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can be shutdown, upgraded and restarted on a RPM based system without a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reboot, right?
</EM><BR>
<P>No.  Not really.  If you are bumping up a major version of shared
<BR>
libraries, as oposed to changing only a minor one, you would be faced
<BR>
with a nice &quot;chicken-and-egg&quot; problem.  I guess that this can be worked
<BR>
around if enough of &quot;basic necessities&quot; you are running are linked
<BR>
static.  In any case you are facing a nice exercise in a graph theory. :-)
<BR>
<P>Your kernel is totally independent of your libraries and can be switched
<BR>
now or later - at your convenience.  The fact that some version comes
<BR>
in a a particular distribution is somewhat coincidental.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Although on a Alpha, everything is much faster then on that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other platform that you could probably reboot, perform a upgrade and be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; done with it without many noticing.
</EM><BR>
<P>I strongly suspect that on any platform it would be faster to upgrade
<BR>
and reboot than to carefuly plan such upheaval.  If you are concerned
<BR>
with a downtime spent doing such changes then 'rpm -Uvh' as many
<BR>
sets as feasible from a new distro, without shutting down, and leave 
<BR>
what is left to a &quot;normal upgrade&quot;.  Whatever was replaced already
<BR>
will be not replaced again thus cutting downtime considerably.
<BR>
<P>Note that if you have long running processes using &quot;deleted in an upgrade&quot;
<BR>
copies of libraries they will hold both to memory and a disk space.
<BR>
Whatever is in use will be purged only when **all** references to
<BR>
it will be gone.  Sometimes you can restart things (syslogd, for
<BR>
example) but sometimes not.
