<P>
<EM>&gt; 	Perhaps because Alpha Processor, Inc. does not feel pressure bearing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; down to convert their current fab plants to a smaller process? I certainly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hope Compaq will move Alpha more and more into the consumer market - with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that strategic move, perhaps they will be motivated to get with the times, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so to speak. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Can we please stop speculating without bothering to refer to the
<BR>
facts? I believe that it was announced a while ago that the EV57 --
<BR>
which is a 21164 produced on the next-smaller-than-0.35 process -- was
<BR>
going to be the cheap processor for the consumer market. At the same
<BR>
time, the EV6 is so late that the EV67 will be out fairly soon. This
<BR>
is the 21264a shrunk down from the original 21264.
<BR>
<P>Now I don't know if you want to believe the dates that were
<BR>
announced. But the strategy is clear, so there's no reason to be
<BR>
posting dozens of emails to this list speculating about what's already
<BR>
known.
