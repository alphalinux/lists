This is getting fun now :). I got to the files I needed to edit and and
<BR>
followed the directions that so many of you gave me (Thanks!) and did
<BR>
ctrl+alt+del to reboot. It starts to boot and get's to the starting services
<BR>
part and it looks though my chages didn't take effect! I saved the files and
<BR>
then opened them again to see if they were ok. I verified with mount that
<BR>
the drive was rw. I chaged th ip #'s and the inittab to 3 and I find the
<BR>
damn thing boot into 5?  I boot back into setup and found files that I had
<BR>
deleted/modified had reappered? This sort of amusing but anoying at the same
<BR>
time :) Any ideas? Thanks
<BR>

Subject: I can't get into my system!
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Funny thing. I brough my Alpha box to school to test it as an application
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and X server on the network there for 25 win 98 machines
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;using xclients. I had to change my ip stuff and changed my inittab to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;runlevel 5 to do this. So I forgot to reset my old settings for my box and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;brought it home and then to my surprise I find out that it hangs on boot.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Specificly it hangs on &quot;starting sendmail&quot; and then I'm stuck. I searched
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the archives and found that neat trick to get into the RH setup and use the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ash shell to do stuff. So I did that and found the files
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I wanted to modify and proceeded to use emacs. There was no emacs :( So I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tried vi. I popped open a file, fumbled around a little and finaly finished
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;up and to my embarisment I found that I did not know the command to save
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;file. help was not available and using quit told me I had to use ! to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;override something.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So my question is could some kind soul please tell me how to save a file in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;vi? Thank you.
