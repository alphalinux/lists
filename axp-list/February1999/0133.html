<EM>&gt;Within this thread there have been several mentions of overclocking the

<EM>&gt;alpha CPU. Has anyone been able to accomplish this (reliably) on any of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the LX/UX boards, and if so how far? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I experimented a bit with running my 533 processor at 600 in an LX board.
<BR>
Superficially, it seemed to work, however, after about an hour or so, I got Sig
<BR>
11s when compiling big stuff as the kernel that I never had before. so I wnet
<BR>
back to 533. With (much) better cooling I assume it will work.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Also, I found some benchmarks comparing the 21164 600 mhz running Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and Digital Unix. The results of the benchmark were that the DU had a FP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nearly three times that of Linux. Does that number, if correct, reflect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any other performance differences b/w the two OSs?  
</EM><BR>
<P>No, these bad numbers reflect differences in **compiler and math lib** quality,
<BR>
partly already fixed. From the numbers I know, often the *SAME* binary even
<BR>
runs a few % faster on Linux.
