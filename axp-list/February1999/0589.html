<P><EM>&gt; The AlphaPC 164LX motherboard has incorporated within it two EIDE ports.  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is my understanding that SCSI is a faster disk access bus on a Linux system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than EIDE because each of the SCSI devices can function autonomously thus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reducing the work load of the CPU.  However it is my reasoning that if only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one device such as a CD-ROM is on the EIDE bus while the hard disk(s) reside
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the SCSI bus then the CD-ROM and hard disks could still function in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parallel without bogging down the CPU.  EIDE CD-ROM drives with write/rewrite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capability are significantly cheaper than their SCSI versions.  If there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is no penalty in having only one CD-ROM drive on the EIDE bus then purchasing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an EIDE CD-ROM drive makes sense.  
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to think of my SCSI bus as a MULTI-ACCESS bus, and my IDE
<BR>
bus as a SINGLE-ACCESS bus.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCSI equipment usually has logic built into them that acts as a
<BR>
sub processor/traffic cop for the scsi bus. IDE does not have this
<BR>
hardware (I have heard that you can buy some advanced PCI EIDE cards that
<BR>
do caching and sub-processing -&gt; Promise Technology?).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IN this way, SCSI wins hands down over EIDE in a server
<BR>
environment as it's bus can have multiple devices all being accessed in an
<BR>
asynchronous or synchronous  fashion(transactions essentially
<BR>
simultaneous, but not quite). 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your system will be multi-user (ie: doing processing and
<BR>
transactions for multiple users at once), or you be doing lots of
<BR>
multi-tasking (ie: RUUNNING multiple programs using cpu time at the SAME
<BR>
time), I would suggest SCSI. If it's just your workstation, and you are
<BR>
not in need of extremely high levels of performance, EIDE will work just
<BR>
fine...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own system has:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EIDE channel 1: 4 gb UDMA hard drive (/,/home, /etc partitions -&gt;
<BR>
very static)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EIDE channel 2: 24x EIDE cd-rom
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qlogic UW Scsi-3: 2x4gb 7200rpm fujitsu UW Scsi 3 drives
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scsi system is where /usr/local is, and is where I do
<BR>
all my work. Also, swap is mounted on a partition on one of these
<BR>
drives to max swap performance.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit unconventional, but I could barely afford the scsi
<BR>
disks I bought. The money I saved by buying EIDE components was enough to
<BR>
buy another 128mb of RAM, and I do not think I sacrificed much useability
<BR>
for my particular environment ( I need RAM much more than disk).
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarize, using EIDE like you propose can provide excellnet
<BR>
price/performance ratios (DEPENDING on your processing environment).
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Has anyone else thought about this?  Please criticize my facts and logic if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyone can see errors in it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will encounter pundits for pure SCSI, and those for pure EIDE,
<BR>
but finding a mix that fits in your budget can provide some nice
<BR>
performance.
