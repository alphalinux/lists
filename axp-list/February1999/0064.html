One of friends had brought in an OS to show me, It was on a floppy. I
<BR>
thought it was Linux but I wasn't even close. He put the disk in and
<BR>
rebooted and in 3 minutes there was a full X windows environment with a
<BR>
web browser and ip configured. It's damn fast too on these P200's. It's
<BR>
called QNX. It's  a real time OS that uses a microkernel and uses all
<BR>
kinds of just cool stuff. It's closed source and runs on Intels only at
<BR>
the moment but it was sooo cool I just had to share it. Check it out at
<BR>
www.qnx.com
