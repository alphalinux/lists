Hello:
<BR>
<P>Continuing with my problems of yesterday, I tried to mount the
<BR>
'ramdisk.img' file by first uncompressing it, and was able to mount it
<BR>
just fine.  So I don't know why that floppy results in a &quot;kernel panic&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Anyways, I was going to install Red Hat over FTP from a local system, and
<BR>
that is why I needed the supplementary disk.  So I thought, to heck with
<BR>
it, and burnt a CD.
<BR>
<P>I booted MILO and then typed:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boot -t iso9660 scd0:kernels/xl.gz root=/dev/scd0
<BR>
<P>exactly as stated in the README file of the 5.2 distribution.
<BR>
<P>The system went through the motions, so obviously I had not made any
<BR>
mistakes burning the CD image, but then it hung with, &quot;kernel panic;
<BR>
unable to mount root VFS&quot;.  ;-(
<BR>
<P>I remember going through a lot of *crap* like this when I was installing
<BR>
5.1.  I think it had something to do with the fact that my old XL wasn't
<BR>
really an XL but a different system?
<BR>
<P>Any ideas?
