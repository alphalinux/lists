<EM>&gt; Funny thing. I brough my Alpha box to school to test it as an application
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and X server on the network there for 25 win 98 machines
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using xclients. I had to change my ip stuff and changed my inittab to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; runlevel 5 to do this. So I forgot to reset my old settings for my box and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brought it home and then to my surprise I find out that it hangs on boot.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Specificly it hangs on &quot;starting sendmail&quot; and then I'm stuck. I searched
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the archives and found that neat trick to get into the RH setup and use the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ash shell to do stuff. So I did that and found the files
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I wanted to modify and proceeded to use emacs. There was no emacs :( So I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tried vi. I popped open a file, fumbled around a little and finaly finished
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up and to my embarisment I found that I did not know the command to save the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; file. help was not available and using quit told me I had to use ! to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; override something.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So my question is could some kind soul please tell me how to save a file in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vi? Thank you.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hey Pete,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought it was quirky that you stopped answering e-mail :-) 
<BR>
Given that I am die-hard vi(m) hacker, saving a file should be easily to 
<BR>
explain:
<BR>
vi has two modes, a command mode and a text entry mode.
<BR>
You probably have discovered the text entry mode on your own.
<BR>
To save a file, hit &lt;Esc&gt; (enters command mode), &lt;:&gt;, hit &lt;w&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;Enter&gt;
<BR>
I am bracketing the keys, so &quot;&lt;w&gt;&quot; simply means you hit the 'w' key.
<BR>
<P>Daniel
