<P>Well, hmm. First of all, no good browser :-(. The good news, though, is
<BR>
that KDE 1.1 does compile straight out of the box (you can drop by our
<BR>
booth at LinuxWorld Expo and see it running on a 164LX-533) and the KDE
<BR>
1.1 browser isn't half bad (even handles cookies now).
<BR>
<P>Secondly, Linux on the Alpha is very much a hacker's platform. It's the
<BR>
way that Linux was four or five years ago on the Intel, where you had to
<BR>
compile things all the time and hack the kernel all the time to deal with
<BR>
weirdness. For example, you'll note that the LX box at the show doesn't
<BR>
light up its little hard drive LED when it's accessing its hard drive.
<BR>
That's because I had about an hour free this morning to get KDE 1.1 and
<BR>
the 2.2.1 kernel going on it prior to it being packed up for the show, and
<BR>
I did not have time to go hunt down a patch to the kernel's initialization
<BR>
routine for the Symbios 53c875 chip that would enable the hard drive
<BR>
light. The patch exists, I have seen it referenced on the kernel-list, but
<BR>
the fact is that you don't have to do that kind of thing on the Intel
<BR>
platform. In short, the Alpha is still for the adventuresome. Those who
<BR>
want to turn on their Linux box and have it just plain work are probably
<BR>
better off sticking with the Intel. But if you're bored with Intel, and
<BR>
want some speed, well, Alpha will give you excitement and speed a'plenty.
