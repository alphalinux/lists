You may want to try the SCSI card in another PCI slot...

Subject: My 2940uw doesnt work on a Dec Alpha
<BR>
<P><P>The last reliable aha-2940 Ultra wide driver for my digital alpha 522LX
<BR>
was when 2.0.33  was released. I have tried 2.0.34-2.0.36  and FIND that
<BR>
the controller gets/does a multitude of failed timeout recoveries which
<BR>
eventually leads to a push of the reset button. I can generally cause
<BR>
this to happen if, lets say i am rebuilding XFree86, and want to use my
<BR>
scsi cdrom.
<BR>
I have 2 untra-wide disks, 1 50pin scsi cdrom, and a 50pin scsi qic24
<BR>
tape drive. ( i also have ide disks )
<BR>
apparently this hasn't cause much of an outcry. But i cannot upgrade
<BR>
until i get some reliable adaptec code for my alpha. so
<BR>
<P>WHAT IS IT THAT I CAN DO TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM ???
<BR>
gat
<BR>
<P>ANYONE else on the axp-list wanna relay their adaptec problems ?

&nbsp;* Modifications made to the aic7xxx.c,v 4.1 driver from Dan Eischen
<BR>
include
<BR>
&nbsp;* but are not limited to:
<BR>
&nbsp;*
<BR>
&nbsp;*  1: Import of the latest FreeBSD sequencer code for this driver
<BR>
&nbsp;*  2: Modification of kernel code to accomodate different sequencer
<BR>
semantics
<BR>
&nbsp;*  3: Extensive changes throughout kernel portion of driver to improve
<BR>
&nbsp;*     abort/reset processing and error hanndling
<BR>
&nbsp;*  4: Other work contributed by various people on the Internet
<BR>
&nbsp;*  5: Changes to printk information and verbosity selection code
<BR>
&nbsp;*  6: General reliability related changes, especially in IRQ management
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;*  7: Modifications to the default probe/attach order for supported
<BR>
cards
<BR>
&nbsp;*  8: SMP friendliness has been improved
<BR>
&nbsp;*
<BR>
&nbsp;* Overall, this driver represents a significant departure from the
<BR>
official
<BR>
&nbsp;* a
<BR>
&nbsp;*
<BR>
&nbsp;* Note: If time and experience should prove me wrong that the middle
<BR>
ware
<BR>
&nbsp;* code Dan writes is reliable in its operation, then I'll retract my
<BR>
above
<BR>
&nbsp;* statements.  But, for those that don't know, I'm from Missouri (in
<BR>
the US)
<BR>
&nbsp;* and our state motto is &quot;The Show-Me State&quot;.  Well, before I will put
<BR>
&nbsp;* faith into it, you'll have to show me that it works :)
