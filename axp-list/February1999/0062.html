<P>
<EM>&gt; I'm sorry what I said was taken as criticism, it wasn't meant to be so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; negatively taken.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually I took it as constructive criticism and it's didn't offend me
<BR>
in the least bit :)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I wonder if Peter could use a version of egcs which has been compiled to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; produce ev4 code rather than ev5.  I have spent a very frustrating week or
</EM><BR>
<P>Here's the solution. Ya know Uncle George, The Java guy? He just
<BR>
released Java 1.2 built with the -mev4 ( I think) option. This will
<BR>
produce code for the lowest common denominator
<BR>
i.e it will run on all platforms, It runs on mine.
<BR>
<P>&lt;snipo&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 533 workstation in the lab and compile stuff there, dump it to JAZ and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take it home.  If it works I will be happy to upload the RPMs.  Peter,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; care to collaborate on this?
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure that'll work but you have to understand I'm running on borrowed
<BR>
space here and I'm allready using over 50 megs. So if you were to
<BR>
rebuild everything that I have and upload it I think my prof would have
<BR>
a few words with me. Though we don't  have to deal with that.
<BR>
Rich Payne of www.alphalinux.org has offered to mirror my work. So both
<BR>
of you could work together to rebuild the packages for use on all Alphas
<BR>
and not just the new ones. 
<BR>
<P>What da ya think?
<BR>
<P>Peter Petrakis
