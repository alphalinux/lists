<P>
Sorry,
<BR>
<P>this is slightly offtopic since I'm fighting with an 2940U, not an UW,
<BR>
but I seem to be bitten by related problems: Hanging off this
<BR>
controller, there is a Plextor CD-ROM (20x), an internal 9.1GB Seagate Barracuda and
<BR>
one of those fairly slow Seagate 23GB drives (external). The machine is an
<BR>
LX, RH 5.1 plus updates, but using the latest RedHat 2.0.36 kernel.  I
<BR>
can reliably hang the machine when transferring large amounts of data
<BR>
(&gt; 1GB) via NFS *or* ftp from (to) the external, slow disk.  The same
<BR>
tests run fine on the internal disk (without the external disk
<BR>
attached). 
<BR>
<P>So, after following this thread my questions refer mainly to this last
<BR>
post by Maurice:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Many people have reported problems in AIC7XXX driver when the devices
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;in the given bus are of mixed with and/or mixed speeds.  What might be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;reason for this phenomenon ?   I myself think, I have had problems with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;different speeds of disks rapidly alternating activity -- wide, and sync,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;but different speeds:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think that many of you may benefit by running the configuration program
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the adaptec card and setting each device for its bus width and data rate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also setting the termination options there is a good thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; While the Adaptec cards are &lt;supposed&gt; to autodetect these things and set
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; themselves, in my experience it simply isn't reliable.
</EM><BR>
<P>So, ...can I mix or not, the reports seem to be slightly contradictory.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you have ARC, AlphaBIOS, or similar BIOS types, you can get the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; program to run for doing the setup (ACU.EXE) at:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.windowsnt.digital.com/support/drivers/drivers.asp">http://www.windowsnt.digital.com/support/drivers/drivers.asp</A>
</EM><BR>
<P>Why ACU.EXE, under AlphaBios one can execute the
<BR>
setup program anyways (or should I run acu.exe rather than hitting Ctrl-A?)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In my experience, on almost any machine, with mixed drives, on any OS, with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whatever drivers, the 2940 is very reliable, *IF* you set it up properly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you don't they get &quot;flaky&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am sitting at my machine with an Adaptec 2940 in it and 5 devices,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; various widths, types, speeds, typing this. It has been running this card
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and most of these drives for 2 years. No problems.
</EM><BR>
<P>What does reliable mean: I thought this machine was reliable until one
<BR>
of my users started these GB transfers... -- anyone beating an Adaptec
<BR>
with this type of load?
<BR>
<P>BTW: With the Adaptec driver that came with 2.0.35, I could hang the
<BR>
machine by local file transfers between the internal and the external
<BR>
disk (swapper cannot sync, kernel panic, Aic7xxx: interupt routine
<BR>
seems to have segfaulted). I am reasonably sure that my network card
<BR>
(a 2114x based card by Lantronix) is OK, since without the external
<BR>
disk there are no problems. Also, the problem can be reproduced by nfs
<BR>
or ftp.  What is annoying is that with the 2.0.36 I don't get any
<BR>
error messages (neither to the console nor to the syslog), the machine
<BR>
is just *dead*.  I have lowered the maximum transfer rate to 5MB/sec;
<BR>
this delays the problem, but doesn't prevent it from occuring
<BR>
eventually.  Personally, I am currently not excluding bad termination
<BR>
or a bad cable for the external disk -- this is something I need to
<BR>
check next, but I appreciate all hints concerning Adaptec drivers.
<BR>
Alternatively, what are good Ultra-SCSI controllers -- I really need
<BR>
this external disk on this machine...
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
