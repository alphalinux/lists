I started this thread on the AlphaNT list and I was just wondering if
<BR>
there are any x86 assembly Gurus around who can verify if this is
<BR>
possible or not. I have no intention nor do I have the skill to do such
<BR>
a thing but if it could be done it would be a big reason to stray from
<BR>
intel and go to Alpha or AMD.
<BR>
<P>&lt;message&gt;
<BR>
<P>&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The decision to pull the spots comes after privacy issues were raised about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Pentium III, which includes technology that allows Internet Web sites to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; identify visitors' computers.
</EM><BR>
<P>I saw the coolest thing in Assembly class today. My prof. explained this
<BR>
method though not the specifics of tricking the Intel processor into
<BR>
thinking it has rebooted so it could change  modes or something. He also
<BR>
told us that all of the Intel chips including todays still have the
<BR>
instruction code in 'em back from the 8086 for backwards compatibility
<BR>
(Why?) and that you could get to those instructions  if you wanted to.
<BR>
Then a light bulb in my head went off :)
<BR>
<P>Intel claims that you have to reboot the computer to disable/enable 
<BR>
this privacy thingee. Soooo given the facts I previously stated it is
<BR>
theoritcly possible to trick the processor that it has rebooted and let
<BR>
you enable/disable the privacy thingee. Now if a second year E.E student
<BR>
could figure out this form of attack ( Not that I even have the skills
<BR>
or care to do that sort of thing). What could a real cracker do if they
<BR>
set their mind to it? Now how secure is Intel's idea? just another
<BR>
reason to stick with Alpha. 
<BR>
<P>&lt;/message&gt;
