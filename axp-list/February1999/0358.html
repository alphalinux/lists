<P>
One might also say that people will live a long life, if u - lets say - eat
<BR>
properly. If u dont then they get flaky.  Once they get flakey, then it becomes
<BR>
a question of what to do.
<BR>
<P>So its nice to say that the adaptec is reliable - so what. Its when there is an
<BR>
exception that has to be taken care of THEN it becomes a real problem for the
<BR>
adaptec aix7xxxx drivers. When this timeout  exception does occure, it appears
<BR>
that thecombination of the driver, and the card never recover enough so that u
<BR>
can either continue, or graciously shutdown. This particular bug still exists,
<BR>
no matter what u do to the hardware to minimize exceptions.
<BR>
<P>this Sort of reminds me of someone else's experience with writing channel
<BR>
command programs for the IBM ( 14 inch) disk drives. The company originally
<BR>
bought real ibm disk drives &amp; controllers. Apparently these drives hiccuped
<BR>
rarely, and the error handler really didn't need to be all that beefy. Later a
<BR>
compatable albeit cheaper brand X drives/controllers  were substituted. The
<BR>
hiccups occured more frequently, and the software driver was enhanced to take
<BR>
care of all the exceptions that just never happened with the real stuff.
<BR>
<P>So, when i was running with 2.0.33, I was a happy hacker. with 2.0.34  those
<BR>
pesky ( and non-recoverable) timeouts kept ruining my sessions. Hardware didn't
<BR>
change. Just the OS.
<BR>
<P>Tried 2.2.0pre9. Seemed like the disk &amp; cdrom was happy. As soon as i accessed
<BR>
the tape drive, that pesky timeout occured. ( from the log the scsi disk went
<BR>
first, and then the tape drive ).
<BR>
Someone replied that the xfer speeds weren't reported, and not calculated for
<BR>
the slow drives. My cdrom &amp; tape did not negotiate sync xfer speeds, and didnt
<BR>
report the speeds that was being used. I changed the AlphaBios setup for the
<BR>
adaptec, and made both try sync negoaiations. Also set termination to bot
<BR>
high&amp;low ( was set on auto ). On reboot, the cdrom reported a sync xfer rate,
<BR>
but not the tape drive. BUT i have not had the timeout occure since.  I am (
<BR>
later ) going to undo what i did to see exactly where the prob is.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>So do u take mega doses of Vitamin C to prevent disease, as sugg by L. Pauling ?
