Hi,
<BR>
<P>Well... I had several buddies at work (long time experienced 
<BR>
programmers) take a look at the problem I'm having compiling SAINT on 
<BR>
Alpha.... no one seems to understand what's going on... check the 
<BR>
preprocessor output.. seems fine. Odd things happening though... when I 
<BR>
added an extra var to the function that was giving the problem.. I got 
<BR>
some really odd results... bascially, I added:
<BR>
<P>int foo;
<BR>
foo = ip-&gt;ip_v;
<BR>
<P>and I got some error saying that:
<BR>
parse error before line xxx (the int foo line above)
<BR>
undeclared variable foo (first used in this function) ...
<BR>
<P>or something along those lines. The thing is, I can't visually see 
<BR>
anything wrong at ALL. there is just a block of comments right above 
<BR>
those two lines that are from the original code. 
<BR>
<P>Seeing that this code compiled without any problems at all on 
<BR>
i386/Linux.... I'm not sure if architecture differences is causing the 
<BR>
problem.. and even if there are such issues.. these don't look like the 
<BR>
type of errors I would get. I'm beginning to think that perhaps there is 
<BR>
something odd with my compiler system, or there are some quirks with 
<BR>
egcs-1.1.1-7.... 
<BR>
<P>D.
