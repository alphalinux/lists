<P>If you look at the original timescales for EV6 and EV67 (i.e. same layout as EV6 but shrunk onto the process to be used for EV7), you'll see that they were expected in consecutive quarters (though not in '99). I assume that means that they don't honestly expect to shift a huge number of the .35u, and instead expect to get the majority of the sales from the .25u.

Having said that, since then, Fabs have been bought and sold and traded etc...
