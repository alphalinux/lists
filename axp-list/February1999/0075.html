&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've all but forgotten what I know of x86 assembly (from the 
<BR>
PC demo scene, more years ago than I care to remember) so that is out of
<BR>
my league.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Intel claims that you have to reboot the computer to disable/enable 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this privacy thingee. Soooo given the facts I previously stated it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; theoritcly possible to trick the processor that it has rebooted and let
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you enable/disable the privacy thingee. Now if a second year E.E student
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could figure out this form of attack ( Not that I even have the skills
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or care to do that sort of thing). What could a real cracker do if they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; set their mind to it? Now how secure is Intel's idea? just another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reason to stick with Alpha. 
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just want to point out that Intel is making the privacy &quot;feature&quot;
<BR>
disabler software, but only for Windows (and only NT, I believe).  One of
<BR>
the interesting consequences of the embedded id implementation is that 
<BR>
we may see an extension of the &quot;Windows-only website&quot; trend - indeed, 
<BR>
&quot;Wintel&quot; sites could become more commonplace than you now think.  Let's
<BR>
say a company developes a streaming media player which makes extensive 
<BR>
use of the Katmai instruction set.  To ensure that only the target audience
<BR>
(x86 w/Katmai instructions) can benefit from the software, the developer 
<BR>
coded a nice routine that checks for a valid PentiumIII id.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This could even be extended to the dark side of computing - let's say 
<BR>
that a malicious bug in silico in the first batch of P3 processors is 
<BR>
discovered which causes a processor freeze.  Future virus authors now have the 
<BR>
benefit of a hardwired identification code to provide their creations with as 
<BR>
a means to target specific machines - if a ex-sysadmin knows that administrator 
<BR>
X and Y's machines have a specific id, they can release a trojan onto the 
<BR>
network with a sort of seek-and-destroy warhead.
<BR>
<P>Once again, it's a great time to use AlphaLinux.
