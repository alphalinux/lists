Well the timeline of events went as followed.  I installed Redhat 5.2 (pre
<BR>
ramdisk fix) on a 21164sx and it exhibited the symptoms I noted before.  I
<BR>
sent in a bug report, and never got any email or related information back
<BR>
from Redhat.  I did another install on a UDB (pre 13-Nov-1998) and had the
<BR>
same problem on that, again I sent in bug reports.  I was stuck in the
<BR>
lobby of a hotel today and was going though old email, and noticed that
<BR>
Redhat never got back to me today, so I wrote that ignorant email to the
<BR>
list and sent it out.  I'm glad to see that there was a fix for it, sorry
<BR>
to make some people angry.
<BR>
<P>Take care,
<BR>
-Barrett
