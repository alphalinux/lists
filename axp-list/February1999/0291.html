<P>
With regards to your message at 05:14 PM 02-09-99 +0100, Stefan Boresch.
<BR>
Where you stated:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Sorry,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So, after following this thread my questions refer mainly to this last
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;post by Maurice:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; I think that many of you may benefit by running the configuration program
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; for the adaptec card and setting each device for its bus width and data
</EM><BR>
rate.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Also setting the termination options there is a good thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; While the Adaptec cards are &lt;supposed&gt; to autodetect these things and set
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; themselves, in my experience it simply isn't reliable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So, ...can I mix or not, the reports seem to be slightly contradictory.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; If you have ARC, AlphaBIOS, or similar BIOS types, you can get the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; program to run for doing the setup (ACU.EXE) at:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; <A HREF="http://www.windowsnt.digital.com/support/drivers/drivers.asp">http://www.windowsnt.digital.com/support/drivers/drivers.asp</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Why ACU.EXE, under AlphaBios one can execute the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;setup program anyways (or should I run acu.exe rather than hitting Ctrl-A?)
</EM><BR>
True, you can, as far as I know..
<BR>
The point is I suggest that people should actually configure the
<BR>
termination, width, speed, etc. for each device properly, rather than
<BR>
trusting the card to &quot;automagically&quot; do it by itself.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; In my experience, on almost any machine, with mixed drives, on any OS, with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; whatever drivers, the 2940 is very reliable, *IF* you set it up properly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; If you don't they get &quot;flaky&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; I am sitting at my machine with an Adaptec 2940 in it and 5 devices,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; various widths, types, speeds, typing this. It has been running this card
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; and most of these drives for 2 years. No problems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What does reliable mean: I thought this machine was reliable until one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of my users started these GB transfers... -- anyone beating an Adaptec
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with this type of load?
</EM><BR>
I would bet $20 that if you stuck a decent active terminator after the
<BR>
external disk, and disabled the termination on the adaptec ( make sure to
<BR>
match the width) it would behave much better..
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;BTW: With the Adaptec driver that came with 2.0.35, I could hang the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;machine by local file transfers between the internal and the external
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disk (swapper cannot sync, kernel panic, Aic7xxx: interupt routine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seems to have segfaulted). I am reasonably sure that my network card
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(a 2114x based card by Lantronix) is OK, since without the external
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disk there are no problems. Also, the problem can be reproduced by nfs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or ftp.  What is annoying is that with the 2.0.36 I don't get any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;error messages (neither to the console nor to the syslog), the machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is just *dead*.  I have lowered the maximum transfer rate to 5MB/sec;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this delays the problem, but doesn't prevent it from occuring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;eventually.  Personally, I am currently not excluding bad termination
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or a bad cable for the external disk -- this is something I need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;check next, but I appreciate all hints concerning Adaptec drivers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Alternatively, what are good Ultra-SCSI controllers -- I really need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this external disk on this machine...
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I always have thought the Intraserver cards based on a Symbios Logic
<BR>
chip are better. In my experience thay are more reliable, and faster.
<BR>
<P>www.intraserver.com   available through many reputable Alpha Linux resellers.
