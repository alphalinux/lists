<P><EM>&gt; Funny thing. I brough my Alpha box to school to test it as an application

<EM>&gt; using xclients. I had to change my ip stuff and changed my inittab to

<EM>&gt; runlevel 5 to do this. So I forgot to reset my old settings for my box and

<EM>&gt; brought it home and then to my surprise I find out that it hangs on boot.

<P>Heh... fun. :)

<P><EM>&gt; Specificly it hangs on &quot;starting sendmail&quot; and then I'm stuck.

<P>How long did you wait?  Sendmail will usually eventually time out, after around
<BR>
10 full minutes.  At least, it did on Intel...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So my question is could some kind soul please tell me how to save a file in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vi? Thank you.
