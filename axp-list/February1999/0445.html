&nbsp;&nbsp;Thatcher,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to the Yahoo auction, found a good price for a PC Air Conditioner,
<BR>
$13.00, took the PCAC apart and took out one fan and reversed the other fan
<BR>
and then put it in the psuedo PCI slot.  The PCI riser card on my UDB has a
<BR>
mini 4-pin power connector that will accept an adapter from a 5.25&quot; to 3.5&quot;
<BR>
adapter kit.  So.. I plugged the power adapter in, looks just like one for
<BR>
a PC floppy, and plugged in the PCAC.  I also screwed in a CPU fan from a
<BR>
486 to the hd/floppy cage and pointed it right at the CPU heat sink. These
<BR>
modification makes it a lot cooler in there, the PCAC now sucks in cool air
<BR>
from the bottom back and distributes it over the mainboard while the power
<BR>
supply fan blows the heated air out the top cooling vents.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The other suggestions about checking all connectors for oxidation,
<BR>
scorched spots, etc. should  also be done.
<BR>

<EM>&gt;  I'm overwhelmed at the amount of people who had suggestions on this one,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thanks all.  After thinking for a minute I decided that I could confirm my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;overheating theory more easily than most others.  So I took the top of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;case off and set it in front of a small box fan.  It's loud, and it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;causing slight jitters on the 19&quot; monitor for my PC right now, but it's been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;up for 18 hours and 53 minutes according to 'top'.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  The box fan is an imperfect solution though, how can I keep this thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cool enough to run for long periods of time?  I've heard you can replace the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exhaust fan in the case (there is indeed plenty of room for that) but I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wondering if that would be enough.  As for the popping, there seems to be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;consensus that that is something in the power supply.  Could this still be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problem, and could it be contributing to the heat problem?  (I'm ignorant of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;electronics theory)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  At any rate, thanks again to the list members for turning out to help a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;new Alpha owner.
