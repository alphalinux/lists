Hi, I have one UX equipped the way you suggest. SCSI HD and EIDE CD-ROM
<BR>
It works fine. SCSI performances are not touched at all. However, I also
<BR>
have a LX with 2 EIDE HD, and here performances are not bad at all. They
<BR>
work perfectly, and yes, cheaper. Just one warning. To have the EIDE HD
<BR>
working fast, you absolutely need a kernel quite up to date. Don't know
<BR>
the exact number, but something greater than 2.1.100. I was totally upset
<BR>
with my slow EIDE HD and a 2.0.35 kernel. I was going to buy a SCSI HD +
<BR>
SCSI controller, when someone on the list suggested to upgrade the kernel.
<BR>
Now it flies. Totally happy of my EIDE HD (in fact, I added a second one
<BR>
to the LX)
<BR>
<P>However, I also agree with Chris, it depends on the load you will put on
<BR>
the HD. In my case, the EIDE HD is /home for 5-6 users, and for a couple
<BR>
of background jobs with 200-300 MB of scratch files. For this kind of
<BR>
load, the EIDE is not a problem. It works fine.

<EM>&gt; &gt; The AlphaPC 164LX motherboard has incorporated within it two EIDE ports.  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is my understanding that SCSI is a faster disk access bus on a Linux system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; than EIDE because each of the SCSI devices can function autonomously thus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reducing the work load of the CPU.  However it is my reasoning that if only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; one device such as a CD-ROM is on the EIDE bus while the hard disk(s) reside
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on the SCSI bus then the CD-ROM and hard disks could still function in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; parallel without bogging down the CPU.  EIDE CD-ROM drives with write/rewrite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; capability are significantly cheaper than their SCSI versions.  If there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is no penalty in having only one CD-ROM drive on the EIDE bus then purchasing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; an EIDE CD-ROM drive makes sense.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	I like to think of my SCSI bus as a MULTI-ACCESS bus, and my IDE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bus as a SINGLE-ACCESS bus.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	SCSI equipment usually has logic built into them that acts as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sub processor/traffic cop for the scsi bus. IDE does not have this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hardware (I have heard that you can buy some advanced PCI EIDE cards that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do caching and sub-processing -&gt; Promise Technology?).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	IN this way, SCSI wins hands down over EIDE in a server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environment as it's bus can have multiple devices all being accessed in an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; asynchronous or synchronous  fashion(transactions essentially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simultaneous, but not quite). 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	If your system will be multi-user (ie: doing processing and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transactions for multiple users at once), or you be doing lots of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; multi-tasking (ie: RUUNNING multiple programs using cpu time at the SAME
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time), I would suggest SCSI. If it's just your workstation, and you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not in need of extremely high levels of performance, EIDE will work just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fine...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	My own system has:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	EIDE channel 1: 4 gb UDMA hard drive (/,/home, /etc partitions -&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very static)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	EIDE channel 2: 24x EIDE cd-rom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	Qlogic UW Scsi-3: 2x4gb 7200rpm fujitsu UW Scsi 3 drives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 		The scsi system is where /usr/local is, and is where I do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all my work. Also, swap is mounted on a partition on one of these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drives to max swap performance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	A little bit unconventional, but I could barely afford the scsi
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disks I bought. The money I saved by buying EIDE components was enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; buy another 128mb of RAM, and I do not think I sacrificed much useability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for my particular environment ( I need RAM much more than disk).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	To summarize, using EIDE like you propose can provide excellnet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; price/performance ratios (DEPENDING on your processing environment).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Has anyone else thought about this?  Please criticize my facts and logic if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; anyone can see errors in it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	You will encounter pundits for pure SCSI, and those for pure EIDE,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but finding a mix that fits in your budget can provide some nice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; performance.
