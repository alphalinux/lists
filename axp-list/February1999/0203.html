Hey,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've got a pretty nice brain teaser of DEC trivia for everyone today.
<BR>
As mentioned in other messages, I use a PWS 500a.  The system had been 
<BR>
sitting in storage for a while when I got it, but was in mint condition; 
<BR>
some papers in the box from Digital are stamped with the date 24 Februrary 
<BR>
1998, so I assume this is a later model 500a.  I had the vendor yank the 8 
<BR>
bpp DEC TGA video card and replace the Qlogic ISP with an Adaptec 2940UW, but 
<BR>
other than that it shipped the same as from the plant. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyhow, here is the discussion I have had with another Alpha 
<BR>
enthusiast regarding the 500a: Everything I have read on the system indicates
<BR>
that the PWS &quot;a&quot; models are designed to run NT (and Linux, of course) and 
<BR>
the PWS &quot;au&quot; models are designed for Digital UNIX and OpenVMS but also can 
<BR>
have ARC/abios.  In fact, I have been told numerous times that the &quot;a&quot; 
<BR>
hardware is incompatible with SRM and do not ship with it as an option.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My system has a badge on the front which clearly reads &quot;500a&quot;, yet
<BR>
the system shipped with SRM as the default power-up firmware.  In fact, 
<BR>
the abios setup allows me to choose &quot;AlphaBIOS&quot;, &quot;Digital UNIX SRM&quot;, 
<BR>
&quot;OpenVMS SRM&quot;, and &quot;ARC&quot; as default power-up modes.  Were late model 
<BR>
PWS &quot;a&quot; systems shipped with both SRM/ARC to extend the life and usefulness
<BR>
of the soon-to-be EOL'd PWS series, or had the capability to run both firmware
<BR>
options been there all along?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it interesting to consider, as some vendors on Usenet have been
<BR>
known to charge ~$2500 more for used &quot;au&quot; system than an &quot;a&quot; system with the 
<BR>
same options.  
<BR>
<P>Best regards,
<BR>
Daniel
