<EM>&gt; &gt; Is it possible to upgrade from RH5.1 to RH5.2 without rebooting?

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes.  It is.  But you will have to do that in the right order
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as there some interdepencies and some actions may be a bit hairy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When you are running the &quot;standard&quot; procedure you do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to worry about that as you run a minimal system from a ramdisk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and doing updates on something else.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thinking no, but perhaps some else knows for sure?

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Yes&quot; answer will be not correct between any two distributions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but between 5.1 and 5.2 you can pull that trick.  Is this an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exercise in a difficult system administration?  If you will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not do some pretty non-standard things while installing shared
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; libraries you better reboot anyway.

<P>Thanks for the info! I guess I'll go ahead and make the disks, reboot, and
<BR>
do a normal upgrade.
<BR>
<P>It was just a idea I had while trying to go to sleep.... Maybe RH should
<BR>
look into making a program to upgrade a RH system without rebooting for
<BR>
future version some day?!? I mean everything except the kernel (of course)
<BR>
can be shutdown, upgraded and restarted on a RPM based system without a
<BR>
reboot, right? Although on a Alpha, everything is much faster then on that
<BR>
other platform that you could probably reboot, perform a upgrade and be
<BR>
done with it without many noticing.
