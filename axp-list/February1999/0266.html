</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The last reliable aha-2940 Ultra wide driver for my digital alpha 522LX
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was when 2.0.33  was released. I have tried 2.0.34-2.0.36  and FIND that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the controller gets/does a multitude of failed timeout recoveries which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eventually leads to a push of the reset button. I can generally cause
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this to happen if, lets say i am rebuilding XFree86, and want to use my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scsi cdrom.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;A colleque of mine has spent some time to look into these questions.
<BR>
His analysis as of yesterday evening was that the AIC7XXX driver has
<BR>
problems in matching speed settings done by BIOS to those reported in
<BR>
card's nvram.   The crux was/is that if the speed set at BIOS, and
<BR>
that reported by the driver does not match, then you will get bus
<BR>
timeouts when you try to exercise all your devices simultaneously.
<BR>
(Especially if their speeds differ..)
<BR>
According to him, it looks like the speed indication code in nvram
<BR>
is mapped thru some table, and then it all the sudden wraps around
<BR>
and shows some lower value in report; typically this is shown as
<BR>
below some threshold value the speeds match in BIOS and AIC driver,
<BR>
above that value they differ.
<BR>
<P>Another thing he commented about is that when the bus-reset occurs,
<BR>
the thing is entirely wedged for the duration of the reset.  No replies
<BR>
from network side to pings, etc.
<BR>
<P>Doug, could the reset be modified so that it need not run in interrupt
<BR>
disable mode ?  Just serialize the access to the driver/card so that
<BR>
nothing else can touch the card during the reset processing ?  Especially
<BR>
with multiple cards in the system a reset in single one should not prevent
<BR>
others from proceeding their separate works.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have 2 untra-wide disks, 1 50pin scsi cdrom, and a 50pin scsi qic24
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tape drive. ( i also have ide disks )
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; apparently this hasn't cause much of an outcry. But i cannot upgrade
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; until i get some reliable adaptec code for my alpha. so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; WHAT IS IT THAT I CAN DO TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM ???
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ANYONE else on the axp-list wanna relay their adaptec problems ?
