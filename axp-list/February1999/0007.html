<P>
I'm sorry what I said was taken as criticism, it wasn't meant to be so
<BR>
negatively taken.
<BR>
<P>I wonder if Peter could use a version of egcs which has been compiled to
<BR>
produce ev4 code rather than ev5.  I have spent a very frustrating week or
<BR>
so trying to solve a great many problems I am currently having with my box
<BR>
since I just lost a 2.7 gig SCSI to a head crash and having put it all
<BR>
back together (currently using my JAZ drive to mirror my home directories
<BR>
and provide /usr/local and /opt space) I have been trying to get KDE-1.1
<BR>
up and running.  Frankly my system is mince and I was very happy to see
<BR>
the RPMs available but distressed having downloaded them to find they
<BR>
wouldn't run.  I do have the latest binutils. 
<BR>
<P>The approach I think I will be taking is to install an ev4 compiler on my
<BR>
533 workstation in the lab and compile stuff there, dump it to JAZ and
<BR>
take it home.  If it works I will be happy to upload the RPMs.  Peter,
<BR>
care to collaborate on this?
<BR>
<P>Incidentally, the PCI 4MB Virge video card has transformed my UDB, I'll be
<BR>
getting another 64MB of RAM and a 3.2 gig IDE drive for it this week too.
<BR>
I actually found a supplier for 44pin laptop IDE cables here in Edinburgh!
<BR>
The new 15 inch LCD panel will make this box &lt;CARTMAN&gt; sweet &lt;/CARTMAN&gt;
<BR>
:-)

<EM>&gt; Maybe you or someone else would be willling to volunteer to do this?

<EM>&gt; I think it is only fair to compliment Peter for all the work he has done,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and continues to do.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I feel that what you said would likely be construed as a criticism, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is just not fair. Peter did this work, in his own private time, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free, and as a gesture of goodwill and kindness to many fellow users. To
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; knock his method or to say he is not thorough enough is not warranted.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As for his compiling for older machines, how is he supposed to test this if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he doesn't _have_ an older machine?
