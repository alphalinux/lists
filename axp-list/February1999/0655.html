Funny thing. I brough my Alpha box to school to test it as an application
<BR>
and X server on the network there for 25 win 98 machines
<BR>
using xclients. I had to change my ip stuff and changed my inittab to
<BR>
runlevel 5 to do this. So I forgot to reset my old settings for my box and
<BR>
brought it home and then to my surprise I find out that it hangs on boot.
<BR>
<P>Specificly it hangs on &quot;starting sendmail&quot; and then I'm stuck. I searched
<BR>
the archives and found that neat trick to get into the RH setup and use the
<BR>
ash shell to do stuff. So I did that and found the files
<BR>
I wanted to modify and proceeded to use emacs. There was no emacs :( So I
<BR>
tried vi. I popped open a file, fumbled around a little and finaly finished
<BR>
up and to my embarisment I found that I did not know the command to save the
<BR>
file. help was not available and using quit told me I had to use ! to
<BR>
override something.
<BR>
<P>So my question is could some kind soul please tell me how to save a file in
<BR>
vi? Thank you.
