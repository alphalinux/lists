<EM>&gt; &gt; Yes.  It is.  But you will have to do that in the right order
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as there some interdepencies and some actions may be a bit hairy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; When you are running the &quot;standard&quot; procedure you do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have to worry about that as you run a minimal system from a ramdisk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and doing updates on something else.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well there is a quick and DIRTY way. Put all the new RPMS (which you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to upgrade) in one directory and do a rpm -Uhv --nodeps  --force
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *.rpm (I had to do it twice and I replaced rpm as the last thing), et
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; voilà you are running rh 5.2.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, not really.  You only think so. :-)
<BR>
<P>The above will be correct only towards processes you started
<BR>
after you performed the above.  There are various long running
<BR>
processes on your machine which are quite hard to restart.  If they
<BR>
are using shared libraries and you updated these then you have
<BR>
double images now of libraries in memory (old ones mapped for
<BR>
old processes and new ones for what you started now) and on a disk
<BR>
as well (a file really disappears if there is no more pending
<BR>
references to it - even if it is becoming unaccesible through a
<BR>
file system).  So you are really runnig a mixture of an old and
<BR>
a new system.
<BR>
<P>In particular 'init' (process number 1) is quite hard to restart
<BR>
without rebooting.  There are some hacky ways around but if your
<BR>
'init' was not designed for that you may have a difficult time. :-)
<BR>
<P>A kernel version is a secondary issue.  Kernels are actually rather
<BR>
independent from the rest and most stuff (not necessarily &quot;all&quot;)
<BR>
will not care.
<BR>
<P>Note also that if your upgrade changed major versions of libraries in the
<BR>
process (NOT the case between 5.1 and 5.2) then the procedure outlined
<BR>
above will make your system totally unusable at some point.  Say you
<BR>
need 'cp' to proceed; if you installed new libraries first than &quot;old cp&quot;
<BR>
ceased to work, but if started with a replacement of 'cp' then it does
<BR>
not work yet as it needs new libraries and you are stuck. There are ways
<BR>
around that as well but the &quot;quick and DIRTY&quot; as above is not good enough.
<BR>
Holding of with replacing 'rpm' does not help as it calls many other
<BR>
things in the course of its work so even statically linked version
<BR>
of rpm is not good enough.  Actually I would start with updating
<BR>
'rpm' first as it is possible that &quot;new rpms&quot; use a format with new
<BR>
fields which are not acceptable to your previous 'rpm' utility; this
<BR>
really happened quite a few times in the past.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michal
<BR>
<P>p.s. Inventing ways to deal with all these difficulties above
<BR>
can be a stimulating intelectual exercise :-) but be careful
<BR>
when experimenting on real systems.  Chances that you hose them
<BR>
are substantial.
