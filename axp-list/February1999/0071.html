</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rebooted and in 3 minutes there was a full X windows environment with a

<EM>&gt; web browser and ip configured. It's damn fast too on these P200's. It's

<EM>&gt; called QNX. It's  a real time OS that uses a microkernel and uses all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kinds of just cool stuff. It's closed source and runs on Intels only at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the moment but it was sooo cool I just had to share it. Check it out at
