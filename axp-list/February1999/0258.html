Just tried 2.2.0 pre9, got the non-recoverable timeouts, and had to hit the
<BR>
reset button. went back to 2.0.33 . Although the cdrom &amp; disks were happy, it
<BR>
is when i used my scsi qic24 tape ( which prob doesn't release the bus until
<BR>
xfer is done ) that cause the (all too familiar) failure.
