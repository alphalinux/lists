What I've heard so far is suprising to me.
<BR>
I have had a Multia for a couple of years now and never had any of this 
<BR>
trouble.
<BR>
But I'm Dutch , and I bought my Multia in Holland (www.request.nl)
<BR>
These Multia's came from a series that were intended for a firm in 
<BR>
England, but
<BR>
have never been used.  The were all complete though, so they have not 
<BR>
been stripped down.
<BR>
A friend of mine had one, with a bad MB, but they replaced it under 
<BR>
warranty  and the
<BR>
machine is running beautifully eversince.
<BR>
I also know someone who bought a Multia already when the weren't dumping 
<BR>
them
<BR>
(This is about 3 or 4 years ago , he paid about $4000) This Multia is 
<BR>
still running beatifull to.
<BR>
<P>I think the question is: Who is stripping these boxes, and can't he be a 
<BR>
bit more carefull ?
<BR>

<EM>&gt; &gt; I have a few multia's, and one had such a problem.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Turned out to be a bad connector...

<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Take the box apart and unseat/reseat all of the cables,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; making sure they're tight and clean. You may want to clean some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of the contacts (_carefully_) with a small piece of steel wool
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Also make sure that the scsi/pci-riser card is seating properly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This would certainly explain spontaneous rebooting, but I am unclear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as to how it could explain &quot;popping&quot; coming from the machine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In any case, I've seen this sort of thing while browsing the list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; archives. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Does anyone have a good theory as to why the Multia seems to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; susceptible to such bad connections? One or two instances of it, and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tend to just shrug it off, but this sort of thing seems to be a common
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem. Makes me wonder just what sort of gremlins run around 
</EM><BR>
underneath
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the hood when we turn the lights out.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I have two theories.
<BR>
1. Many of these machines were stripped down in a hurry.
<BR>
Memory and disk was removed with no clear intenion of ever using
<BR>
the old box again. One of mine has a missing power-connector pin,
<BR>
luckily one of the ground pins...
<BR>
2. Typically, old cardboard boxes of &quot;stuff no-one is going to use&quot;
<BR>
receive none-to-gentle handling in storage. This would apply to
<BR>
both stripped down _and_ &quot;complete&quot; mchines.
