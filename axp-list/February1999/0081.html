<P><EM>&gt; I started this thread on the AlphaNT list and I was just wondering if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there are any x86 assembly Gurus around who can verify if this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible or not.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I'm not an x86 assembly guru, but I did migrate to Linux from OS/2, and 
<BR>
this is &quot;common knowledge&quot; in that world.  :)
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I saw the coolest thing in Assembly class today. My prof. explained this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; method though not the specifics of tricking the Intel processor into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thinking it has rebooted so it could change  modes or something.
</EM><BR>
<P>He was probably talking about the trick that one of the OS/2 developers at IBM 
<BR>
came up with.  Originally, when OS/2 was in early development, it was being 
<BR>
aimed at the 286.  The 286 has a protected mode (i.e. mode with hardware memory 
<BR>
management enabled) but I think during the boot process OS/2 needed to be able 
<BR>
to hot-switch between real and protected modes.
<BR>
<P>The 286 did not support this (once you went into protected mode, there was no 
<BR>
going back) so somebody at IBM came up with a way to fool the CPU into thinking 
<BR>
it had rebooted so it could be switched back into real mode.  This was 
<BR>
described as &quot;turning the engine off and then back on again at 55 mph.&quot;  They 
<BR>
actually patented this method.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Intel claims that you have to reboot the computer to disable/enable 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this privacy thingee. Soooo given the facts I previously stated it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; theoritcly possible to trick the processor that it has rebooted and let
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you enable/disable the privacy thingee.
</EM><BR>
<P>The 386 and later processors support hot-switching between real and protected 
<BR>
modes, so the particular hack I describe above was rendered obsolete by later 
<BR>
Intel processors.  I.e. it was specific to the 286, so the fact that it worked 
<BR>
once doesn't mean that it works on current Intel processors.  In fact, Intel 
<BR>
may have &quot;fixed&quot; this particular &quot;feature&quot; to prevent it being exploited by 
<BR>
e.g. virii.
<BR>
<P>Of course, I could be wrong.  I'm not Intel expert, either.  If you can develop 
<BR>
a work-around once, you can do it again.  :)
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; He also told us that all of the Intel chips including todays still have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instruction code in 'em back from the 8086 for backwards compatibility
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Why?) and that you could get to those instructions  if you wanted to.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then a light bulb in my head went off :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, anything that's called an &quot;x86&quot; CPU has all the original 8086 
<BR>
instructions.  I would imagine that this is only at a functionality level:  
<BR>
i.e. the Pentium III supports the 8086 instructions, but does not actually 
<BR>
include any of the actual silicon guts of the 8086.  So, it's like the POSIX 
<BR>
API:  every UNIX supports fork(), but each implements it in its own way.  The 
<BR>
exploits that work vs. one UNIX's fork() aren't necessarily going to work 
<BR>
against another's.  Every x86 supports the 8086 instructions, but the exploit 
<BR>
used to do the hot-reset of the 286 may not work on later CPUs.
