<P>
I am not yet an alpha owner/user but I've been lurking on this list for
<BR>
some weeks to determine the feasability of using a alpha/linux platform.
<BR>
<P>I'm looking to put together a fairly network intensive application and
<BR>
have been perusing the source of the various linux NIC drivers.
<BR>
<P>I was just about set on using the ZNYX 346/348 dual/quad port board
<BR>
when I found in
<BR>
<P>src/linux/net/de4x5.c  (from 2.2.1)
<BR>
<P>the following comment:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have removed the buffer copies needed for receive on Intels.  I cannot
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove them for   Alphas since  the  Tulip hardware   only does longword
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aligned  DMA transfers  and  the  Alphas get   alignment traps with  non
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;longword aligned data copies (which makes them really slow). No comment.
<BR>
<P>I presume that the author meant 32bit for the first longword, and 64bit
<BR>
for the second longword.
<BR>
<P>Is this still an issue with tulip-like cards on the Alpha?
<BR>
<P>Looking at the yellowfin (gigabit) driver it seems that it can both skip
<BR>
the extra copy and is 64bit aligned by nature of the cards being 64bit
<BR>
PCI cards.  However, the density of ports low (1 per 64bit PCI slot).
<BR>
