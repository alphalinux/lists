<P>
I would like to offer my less scientific results of the problem I had with
<BR>
the 2940UW card.  I also experienced the infinitive SCSI bus-reset, it was
<BR>
on a regular basis crashed after a day of uptime almost regularly.  The
<BR>
first thing I did was upgrade the drivers to the latest version available
<BR>
but that did not seem to help much.  I took at look at my cron jobs, and it
<BR>
turns out I did a daily backup to my DAT drive.  The old SCSI DAT device
<BR>
(when used heavily) caused the bus-reset.  I removed the DAT off of that
<BR>
adapter and placed it on its own.  Now I only run the exact same type
<BR>
devices (UW vs W) on each SCSI chain. 
<BR>
<P>This may be an ignorant solution but it did work for me.
<BR>
<P>On another note, when I did have the resets the kernel was still in full
<BR>
operation, ports would open on the machine yet because of zero disk access
<BR>
nothing would happen.  All my machines are remotely administrated so I
<BR>
created a ramdisk and placed statically compiled bins for in.telnetd (with
<BR>
remote logging), a shell, and a few other utilities on the ramdisk.  This
<BR>
enabled me to get access to the machine during the resets to do debugging.
<BR>
The one action that helped when trying to get the system back up without
<BR>
rebooting was by trying to sync all the mounted filesystems, if you have
<BR>
local access to the machine you could try the sysrq 's' command to do this.
<BR>
<P>Good luck with the machine.

<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; The last reliable aha-2940 Ultra wide driver for my digital alpha 522LX
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; was when 2.0.33  was released. I have tried 2.0.34-2.0.36  and FIND that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; the controller gets/does a multitude of failed timeout recoveries which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; eventually leads to a push of the reset button. I can generally cause
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; this to happen if, lets say i am rebuilding XFree86, and want to use my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; scsi cdrom.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  A colleque of mine has spent some time to look into these questions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;His analysis as of yesterday evening was that the AIC7XXX driver has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;problems in matching speed settings done by BIOS to those reported in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;card's nvram.   The crux was/is that if the speed set at BIOS, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;that reported by the driver does not match, then you will get bus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;timeouts when you try to exercise all your devices simultaneously.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;(Especially if their speeds differ..)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;According to him, it looks like the speed indication code in nvram
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;is mapped thru some table, and then it all the sudden wraps around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;and shows some lower value in report; typically this is shown as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;below some threshold value the speeds match in BIOS and AIC driver,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;above that value they differ.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Another thing he commented about is that when the bus-reset occurs,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;the thing is entirely wedged for the duration of the reset.  No replies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;from network side to pings, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Doug, could the reset be modified so that it need not run in interrupt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;disable mode ?  Just serialize the access to the driver/card so that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;nothing else can touch the card during the reset processing ?  Especially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;with multiple cards in the system a reset in single one should not prevent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;others from proceeding their separate works.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; I have 2 untra-wide disks, 1 50pin scsi cdrom, and a 50pin scsi qic24
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; tape drive. ( i also have ide disks )
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; apparently this hasn't cause much of an outcry. But i cannot upgrade
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; until i get some reliable adaptec code for my alpha. so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; WHAT IS IT THAT I CAN DO TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM ???
</EM><BR>
