<P>
I recently purchased two non-Digital 64 mb true parity 60ns FPM SIMMs (128 mb) from someone who had them working in a multia udb. But the architecture of the simms was too high for the multia case and he needed to sell them.
<BR>
<P>I purchased them for an alphastation 200 4/233. The as200 had only two Digital 8 mb 70ns parity SIMMs in it and it runs fine with the two 8 mb simms (except that the as200 needs a whole lot more memory than that for the applications I need to run.)
<BR>
<P>But the as200 will not boot up at all with the two 64's in it (with or without the two 8's). It stalls at the initial point of checking memory, I guess. I do have the most current firmware for the alpha loaded up.
<BR>
<P>Are there any jumpers on the mb that need to be changed, or are these just bad simms for the as200?
<BR>
<P>Where can I pick up some good inexpensive simms for the as200?
<BR>
<P>Thanks
