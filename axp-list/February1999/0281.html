<EM>&gt; &gt;   A colleque of mine has spent some time to look into these questions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; His analysis as of yesterday evening was that the AIC7XXX driver has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; problems in matching speed settings done by BIOS to those reported in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; card's nvram.   The crux was/is that if the speed set at BIOS, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that reported by the driver does not match, then you will get bus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; timeouts when you try to exercise all your devices simultaneously.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (Especially if their speeds differ..)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; According to him, it looks like the speed indication code in nvram
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is mapped thru some table, and then it all the sudden wraps around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and shows some lower value in report; typically this is shown as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; below some threshold value the speeds match in BIOS and AIC driver,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; above that value they differ.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Paah.  Your collegue needs to re-read that code, then read the AWAITING_MSG:
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whops, I was reporting him inaccurately.
<BR>
He did *only* quote on what the kernel reported at at bootup, not what
<BR>
the code contains.  Oh yes, his platform is intel, not Alpha..
<BR>
<P>Many people have reported problems in AIC7XXX driver when the devices
<BR>
in the given bus are of mixed with and/or mixed speeds.  What might be
<BR>
reason for this phenomenon ?   I myself think, I have had problems with
<BR>
different speeds of disks rapidly alternating activity -- wide, and sync,
<BR>
but different speeds:

<P><P>I haven't had time recently (for a few months) to play with various
<BR>
possible ways to cause this setup to reset the bus.  The 0/0/1/0 disk
<BR>
was recently changed when it begun to produce spodaric media errors.
<BR>
<P>Before that it used to report speed of 20.0 MByte/sec, and I could
<BR>
crash the bus by doing a 'dd' originating from raw 0/0/1/0 disk to
<BR>
a file at filesystem on a RAID0-set on 0/0/2/0 + 0/0/4/0 disk pair.
<BR>
<P>I don't anymore remember what the driver version was back then.
