<P><EM>&gt; So what is the app that IDLE's at max rpm ?
</EM><BR>
<P>It's Apache JServ (Servlet Engine) v1.0b2 running on kernel 2.2.1.
<BR>
Since Servlets are basically Java CGI handlers, the Servlet engine spends a lot
<BR>
of time idling when the web server isn't being hit.  (Which is most of the time,
<BR>
since I'm the only one that ever uses it. :)
<BR>
<P>With your JDK 1.2, the java process owned by nobody associated with the apache
<BR>
process is at around 96% of the CPU time;  rc5des drops to 1.5% (though of
<BR>
course it runs at lowest priority.)  With your JDK 1.1.7v2, the java process
<BR>
drops to 1.5% and rc5des goes up to 96%.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; green threads, with Linux 2.0.x serieas just cant be allowed to fully IDLE.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is a problem not with green threads but with the OS's failure to inform
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the jdk ( through SIGIO's ) that I/O is possible. If this was reliable, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the green-threads can just pause() until some interrupt. This is a prob withi
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; network connections.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I don't know the details.  I was merely refering to an explanation I saw
<BR>
on the problem somewhere, either blackdown or the JServ home page
<BR>
(java.apache.org.)  I can't remember which site I saw it at.
