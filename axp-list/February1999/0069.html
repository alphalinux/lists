Yeah.. I've seen this before... actually... somewhere on my desk here is 
<BR>
a floppy with QNX... we were considering developing a light weight 
<BR>
network sniffer on it once... but ended up with OpenBSD.
<BR>
<P>But yes, it is pretty amazing what they can fit on one floppy.. I 
<BR>
believe it even has a webserver on it.
<BR>
<P>D.

<EM>&gt;One of friends had brought in an OS to show me, It was on a floppy. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thought it was Linux but I wasn't even close. He put the disk in and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rebooted and in 3 minutes there was a full X windows environment with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;web browser and ip configured. It's damn fast too on these P200's. It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;called QNX. It's  a real time OS that uses a microkernel and uses all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;kinds of just cool stuff. It's closed source and runs on Intels only at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the moment but it was sooo cool I just had to share it. Check it out at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;www.qnx.com
