<P>I've been trying fairly regularly and following the development;  I even

submitted a one-character patch to configure.in to detect ALL alphas rather
<BR>
than alpha-unknown-linux-gnu (i.e. I changed alpha-*-linux* to
<BR>
alpha*-*-linux*);  CVS revision 1.173 is the Dan Morrill version of
<BR>
configure.in.  :)

<P>Anyway, yes, it builds and &quot;runs&quot;, at least as well as it does on any Linux
<BR>
platform.  It handles the test pages fine, and does them well enough to amaze
<BR>
you with its speed and standards support (my personal favorite is the table
<BR>
embedded on an HTML 4.0 button with a background image), but it does not yet
<BR>
approach something like a useable browser.
<BR>
<P>In other words, Mozilla for Linux/Alpha is at parity with Mozilla for
<BR>
Linux/Intel.  There are no 64-bit issues, so as soon as it's ready for any
<BR>
platform, it'll be ready for the Alpha.
