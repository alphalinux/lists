<P>
Howdy All,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I finally got some RAM for my Multia/UDB and it boots up no problem
<BR>
(incidently, compaq double-bit parity used in prosignia/proliants (at least
<BR>
the prosignia 300 and the old proliants) works in multias.. May be a waste
<BR>
to some, but it worked for me). However, I am now contemplating what
<BR>
harddrive to use. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I currently have a Seagate Barracuda (7200 RPM) drive installed. Again,
<BR>
this may be a waste to some, but hey, this is stuff I got for free...
<BR>
Anyhow, I'm wondering if the drive will overheat in the multia.. I ran it
<BR>
for about 2 hours and popped open the case and the drive felt warm to the
<BR>
touch, but nowhere near as hot as the CPU (damn.. didn't know these things
<BR>
ran so hot ;) ). Does anyone have experience with a 7200 rpm drive in a
<BR>
multia?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If bad things could possibly happen, I may put the barracuda in another
<BR>
machine. If that happens, I will need a new drive. I don't need anything
<BR>
huge, since this is going to be a firewall/webserver. I'm thinking about
<BR>
replacing it with a 1.7 gig IDE laptop drive (they're $89 at
<BR>
www.centrix-intl.com).. How is the IDE performance on Multias with the new
<BR>
kernels?
<BR>
<P>Thanks for any info you can provide.
<BR>
<P>Mike
