<P><EM>&gt; Chris, I set up xntp on our network at work.  I like the amount of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligence built into the protocol.  What I'm dealing with here is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my net at home, and I want to reduce the amount of error to a minimum
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before I dial in and get ntp updates. 
</EM><BR>
<P>In this case, just configure xntpd to use a driftfile. From the xntp
<BR>
documentation:
<BR>
<P>&quot; One of the things the NTP daemon does when it is first started is to
<BR>
compute the error in the intrinsic frequency of the clock on the
<BR>
computer it is running on. It usually takes about a day or so after
<BR>
the daemon is started to compute a good estimate of this (and it needs
<BR>
a good estimate to synchronize closely to its server). Once the
<BR>
initial value is computed, it will change only by relatively small
<BR>
amounts during the course of continued operation. The driftfile
<BR>
declaration indicates to the daemon the name of a file where it may
<BR>
store the current value of the frequency error so that, if the daemon
<BR>
is stopped and restarted, it can reinitialize itself to the previous
<BR>
estimate and avoid the day's worth of time it will take to recompute
<BR>
the frequency estimate. &quot;
<BR>
<P>So basically.. set it up with a driftfile parameter in the ntp.conf
<BR>
and then do your best to keep the machine online for a long period of
<BR>
time. Once it has a good estimate of how much drift is in your
<BR>
machine's clock written there.. xntpd will be able to keep your clock
<BR>
in sync pretty reliably, even without network connectivity.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I also need to dig through the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pppd docs to make sure port 123 calls aren't considered 'interesting'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough to kick off a phone call...  This may be a good project for this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evening if I don't get derailed :-)  I'll report results.
</EM><BR>
<P>More importantly, make sure pppd isn't going to try to automagically
<BR>
log you in any time xntpd feels lonely. Unfortunately
<BR>
(well.. actually, not so unfortunately) I haven't had to use pppd for
<BR>
network access, so I can't help ya there.
