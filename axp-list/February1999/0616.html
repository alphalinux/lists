<P><EM>&gt; Well, hmm. First of all, no good browser :-(. The good news, though, is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that KDE 1.1 does compile straight out of the box (you can drop by our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; booth at LinuxWorld Expo and see it running on a 164LX-533) and the KDE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1.1 browser isn't half bad (even handles cookies now).
</EM><BR>
<P>I am using mozilla from... (somewhere??) with lesstif-0.87.1-2 it feels as
<BR>
stable as the x86 version with the exception that sometimes it renders
<BR>
some HTML incorrectly but usually does okay if you click &quot;refresh&quot; and
<BR>
also whines occasionally that it can't find &quot;BtnUp and BtnDown&quot; but other
<BR>
than those two things IMHO it is as stable as netscape for x86 Linux and
<BR>
for sure, more stable than Internet Exploder on Windoze 95. It even 
<BR>
renders the mess they call HTML at startrek.com as well as the x86 version
<BR>
but much faster!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Secondly, Linux on the Alpha is very much a hacker's platform. It's the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way that Linux was four or five years ago on the Intel, where you had to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compile things all the time and hack the kernel all the time to deal with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weirdness. For example, you'll note that the LX box at the show doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; light up its little hard drive LED when it's accessing its hard drive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's because I had about an hour free this morning to get KDE 1.1 and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 2.2.1 kernel going on it prior to it being packed up for the show, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I did not have time to go hunt down a patch to the kernel's initialization
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; routine for the Symbios 53c875 chip that would enable the hard drive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; light. The patch exists, I have seen it referenced on the kernel-list, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the fact is that you don't have to do that kind of thing on the Intel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; platform. In short, the Alpha is still for the adventuresome. Those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to turn on their Linux box and have it just plain work are probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; better off sticking with the Intel. But if you're bored with Intel, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want some speed, well, Alpha will give you excitement and speed a'plenty. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Umm, I don't think we are 4 to 5 years behind the x86 group... 1 to 1 1/2
<BR>
year(s) sounds a bit closer. Most problems come from 32 --&gt; 64 bit issues.
<BR>
<P>BTW all you IA64 lovers out there (if there are any) are going to have the
<BR>
same problems but most likely worse as the compilers and friends will be
<BR>
&quot;green&quot;.
<BR>
<P><P>Alpha + Linux is not perfect (yet) and I would not recommend an Alpha 
<BR>
Linux box to someone &quot;green&quot; to Linux. 
<BR>
<P>BUT! If you are at least willing to learn some &quot;C&quot; (if you want to port 32
<BR>
bit apps to Alpha), are not afraid to build your own kernel (when you out 
<BR>
grow the Red Hat one), and want the fastest platform out there - then
<BR>
there is now doubt an Alpha is the way to go.
<BR>
<P><P>&quot;..but the fact is that you don't have to do that kind of thing on the
<BR>
Intel platform.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I would have to disagree, I find myself having to do that on both
<BR>
platforms. There are a lot of x86 systems that wont run Linux at all. The
<BR>
only Alphas I know of that wont run Linux are the 7 year old TURBO channel
<BR>
machines. Although I've heard/read that work is being done to port Linux
<BR>
to them.
