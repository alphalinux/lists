<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;   A colleque of mine has spent some time to look into these questions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; His analysis as of yesterday evening was that the AIC7XXX driver has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; problems in matching speed settings done by BIOS to those reported in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; card's nvram.   The crux was/is that if the speed set at BIOS, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; that reported by the driver does not match, then you will get bus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; timeouts when you try to exercise all your devices simultaneously.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; (Especially if their speeds differ..)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; According to him, it looks like the speed indication code in nvram
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; is mapped thru some table, and then it all the sudden wraps around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; and shows some lower value in report; typically this is shown as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; below some threshold value the speeds match in BIOS and AIC driver,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; above that value they differ.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Paah.  Your collegue needs to re-read that code, then read the

AWAITING_MSG:

<EM>&gt;   Whops, I was reporting him inaccurately.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;He did *only* quote on what the kernel reported at at bootup, not what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the code contains.  Oh yes, his platform is intel, not Alpha..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Many people have reported problems in AIC7XXX driver when the devices
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the given bus are of mixed with and/or mixed speeds.  What might be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reason for this phenomenon ?   I myself think, I have had problems with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;different speeds of disks rapidly alternating activity -- wide, and sync,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but different speeds:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
I think that many of you may benefit by running the configuration program
<BR>
for the adaptec card and setting each device for its bus width and data rate.
<BR>
Also setting the termination options there is a good thing.
<BR>
While the Adaptec cards are &lt;supposed&gt; to autodetect these things and set
<BR>
themselves, in my experience it simply isn't reliable.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have ARC, AlphaBIOS, or similar BIOS types, you can get the
<BR>
program to run for doing the setup (ACU.EXE) at:

<BR>
<P>In my experience, on almost any machine, with mixed drives, on any OS, with
<BR>
whatever drivers, the 2940 is very reliable, *IF* you set it up properly.
<BR>
If you don't they get &quot;flaky&quot;.
<BR>
I am sitting at my machine with an Adaptec 2940 in it and 5 devices,
<BR>
various widths, types, speeds, typing this. It has been running this card
<BR>
and most of these drives for 2 years. No problems.
