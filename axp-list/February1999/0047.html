<EM>&gt;If one were to build a Alpha machine for use as a graphics machine, what

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I assume CPU would be 21264... ideally

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But what graphics card? What software is available that would use

<EM>&gt;specialized hardware? And just for fun, what monitor?

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;How would the ideal Alpha based graphics machine (exclude clustering)

<EM>&gt;compare with a SGI?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depends on if you're considering price or other features, and if you're
<BR>
talking one of their new NT machines or one of the MIPS machines.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new NT machines have a really sophisticated graphics/video setup
<BR>
built into the motherboard that uses a special memory setup to access up to 980
<BR>
MB of RAM for texture mapping, etc. It's far and away faster (for 3D stuff,
<BR>
particularly) than anything on the market that needs to use an AGP or PCI bus.
<BR>
The machines support either two (the &quot;320&quot;) or four (the &quot;540&quot;) processors
<BR>
(Pentium III's) using SGI's own chipset (rather than an Intel version) and
<BR>
is more efficient (as in: you pretty much double your speed when you double the
<BR>
processors). The NT machines start at $3300 for the 320 and $5600 for the 540.
<BR>
The 320 supports IDE drives (built in) and the 540 supports Ultra2 SCSI (built
<BR>
in).  The 540 also supports 2 GB RAM, and I have a feeling that you'd have to
<BR>
be a pretty sophisticated gamer to run out of speed if you buy the four CPU by
<BR>
600 Mhz version due out later this year.  Digital video will support two video
<BR>
streams in or out in real time at up to 60 fps. The video system will support
<BR>
any of their monitors up to and including the 24&quot; Sony Trinitron-based
<BR>
wide-screen HDTV shaped monitor AND the 17.5&quot; (diagonal) 15&quot; x 9&quot; HDTV-shape
<BR>
108 dpi widescreen flat active matrix monitor.   
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MIPS-based machines,particularly the OCTANE, offer videoboard 
<BR>
modularity and dual processors. More than...er...adequate. But pricey. Irix is
<BR>
very easy to use and very stable and optimized for graphics.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alphas are good, but don't really compare.
