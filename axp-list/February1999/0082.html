Quoting Dan (<A HREF="mailto:morrildl@nycap.rr.com?subject=Re:%20Crack%20intel's%20privacy%20code?">morrildl@nycap.rr.com</A>):
<BR>
<EM>&gt; He was probably talking about the trick that one of the OS/2 developers at IBM 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; came up with.  Originally, when OS/2 was in early development, it was being 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aimed at the 286.  The 286 has a protected mode (i.e. mode with hardware memory 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; management enabled) but I think during the boot process OS/2 needed to be able 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to hot-switch between real and protected modes.
</EM><BR>
<P>The technique I remember OS/2 using was to load some information into the
<BR>
state of the keyboard controller processor, so that when the 286 came back up
<BR>
it was told by that processor where to jump.  It was exceptionally cool, but
<BR>
klugy as all hell.
