Well, there have been many suggestions about how this problem occurs and
<BR>
what to do and I can say that I have had the same problem with my multia
<BR>
and cured it for no cost in the following way.  A bit of solder.  Turns
<BR>
out that the crappy AT style connector that brings power to the
<BR>
motherboard had got a little lose in its old age since I have had this
<BR>
thing open a few times and the machine started to spontaneously die with a
<BR>
little pop.  It would sometimes run for hours and then die and other times
<BR>
it wouldn't even make it into MILO before it happened.  What I did was to
<BR>
put a bit of solder on each of the blade connectors from the motherboard
<BR>
and this made for a much tighter fit of the connector from the power
<BR>
supply.  The machine hasn't died since.
