<EM>&gt; watch out!  Recursive semaphores were *** removed ***.  They were added
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just in time for 2.2.0, to guard against a problem discovered right
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before release , and caused a lot of teeth gnashing, unhappines and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assorted breakage in various drivers.  Now the original problem was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solved in another way and &quot;recursive semaphores&quot;, which is a strange
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concept on its own, are out.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite right, my mistake.  The visual cortex seems to fade out around
<BR>
midnight with me.  If I didn't have a paper to finish up, I'd be fast
<BR>
asleep certainly. 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Backing out recent changes is only a &quot;band-aid&quot; solution which should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not stay.  This is NOT a desired fix.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Completely agree with you.  Dave Miller is implementing 
<BR>
&quot;proper&quot; semaphores under sparc64 at the moment.  I'm waiting for
<BR>
him to get back with me about a vger tree question before tackling
<BR>
the permanent solution.  I pointed out several times that the 
<BR>
patches are not meant to be a permanent fixture; they exist for the sole
<BR>
purpose of allowing developers to run the latest kernel while working
<BR>
on the larger problems.  A person at Cygnus is supposed to help with 
<BR>
the project, but I've not gotten in contact with him yet.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
Daniel
