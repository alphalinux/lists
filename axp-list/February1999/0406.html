<EM>&gt; &gt;   I bought a Multia not so long ago off of onsale.  After putting 64MB of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; RAM (true parity TI),an external 2GB drive and RedHat 5.2 on it, I found it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would reboot spontaneously.  At first, I believed it to be an aging battery
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and so replaced it.  Now, it is still doing the same thing.  It just blanks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and reboots, with some weird, very quiet popping noises from inside the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; case.  Times between reboots vary from 5 to 35 minutes.  Is this a heat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; related problem?  I have the machine in the vertical stand, and it's not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; near any other equipment that produces a great deal of heat.  Is my box
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; doomed to be unreliable?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my udb had this problem a year or two back.  when it got so frequent that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it was totally unusable, i took it in to the digital service center, where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they told me i had a bad power supply, which they replaced for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; small(?) fee of $110.  since then, it has performed beautifully.  it had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the same symptoms as yours, so i fear you may have the same probem ...
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll second this diagnoses.  You have a dying power supply.  That little
<BR>
popping sound is the core of the transformer being repeatedly energized
<BR>
and de-energized as the switcher tries to start.  My UDB just went the
<BR>
same way.  Rather than try to purchase a new supply, I just bought a
<BR>
bare-bones UDB from CPU Micromart and slid my existing chassis in.
<BR>
<P>Up and running again :-).

<P>p.s. - For the frugal among us, it may well be possible to kludge on a
<BR>
standard PC power supply.  Just be sure to disconnect whatever voltage is
<BR>
currently trying to exit the pin used by the UDB for the speaker &lt;g&gt;.
