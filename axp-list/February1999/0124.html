<P>
Within this thread there have been several mentions of overclocking the
<BR>
alpha CPU. Has anyone been able to accomplish this (reliably) on any of
<BR>
the LX/UX boards, and if so how far? 
<BR>
<P>Also, I found some benchmarks comparing the 21164 600 mhz running Linux
<BR>
and Digital Unix. The results of the benchmark were that the DU had a FP
<BR>
nearly three times that of Linux. Does that number, if correct, reflect
<BR>
any other performance differences b/w the two OSs?  
<BR>
<P>Thanks!
<BR>
