<P>
This weekend I was working on the one of the LX164s at work trying to
<BR>
install a couple of 16GB IBM IDE drives.  It wasn't working right, so I
<BR>
decided to upgrade the BIOS (5.60).  Well, the new BIOS (5.66-1) didn't work
<BR>
with the old version of MILO (2.0.30 build 8), so I upgraded it (2.0.32pre)
<BR>
which worked even less, so I backed off on MILO (2.0.30 build 88) which
<BR>
didn't work in yet another way, so I backed off on the BIOS (5.66) which
<BR>
seemed to work (didn't fix the HD problem, it turned out that using fdisk to
<BR>
force the drives into LBA fixed that (I can't understand it, the machine
<BR>
seemed to have a problem with an IDE drive with 32760 cylinders :-) )).
<BR>
<P>With the old BIOS/MILO combo (5.60/2.0.30-8) the machine would never do a
<BR>
soft reboot.  It would return to MILO from the kernel, countdown from 30,
<BR>
then shit itself.  If you hit escape, it would immediately shit itself.
<BR>
With the new combo (5.66/2.0.30-88) soft reboots act odd as well.  It
<BR>
returns to MILO, but the countdown freezes at 29.  If you hit escape, it
<BR>
goes ahead and boots, but is very flaky until a) it crashes, or b) the
<BR>
operator gets anoyed and does a hard reset.
<BR>
<P>What is the best LX164 AlphaBIOS and MILO?.
<BR>
<P>I've read about shooting MILO directly into the flash chip, but could find
<BR>
no mention of it working on a LX164.  Is it possible?  Would it work better
<BR>
than using ARC to start MILO?
<BR>
<P>I've never actually seen an Alpha do an unattended reboot, is it just a
<BR>
pipe-dream, or does it actually happen for some?  Admittedly, I've only ever
<BR>
worked with LX164s.
<BR>
<P>Hopefully, I'll be putting a PC64 together this weekend, all the same
<BR>
questions apply to it.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for your time,
<BR>
Chris
