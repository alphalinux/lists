<P>
I reported this problem earlier, but I thought I fixed it--wrong!
<BR>
<P>I installed new RH 5.2 and after getting going seemingly OK, the system froze.
<BR>
I then rebooted with my old 2.0.34 kernel from my RH 5.1
<BR>
and things seemed fine (except for the old Adaptec SCSI problems).
<BR>
<P>Then I tried the 2.0.36 kernel (from the RH 5.2 errata) and that, too,
<BR>
froze after some time.  I have not seen any log messages that
<BR>
indicate what is happening.  For some reason, the new kernels
<BR>
don't like my box and my RH 5.2.  I'm limping along with the 2.0.34
<BR>
kernel, but would like to get ahead.  I've collected all the pieces
<BR>
for the 2.2.1 kernel (and all the required upgrades to companion
<BR>
programs) but I wonder if I will have more problems.
<BR>
<P>I went so far as to use the updated ramdisk to reinstall RH 5.2
<BR>
just in case something else wasn't quite right, but to no avail.
<BR>
<P>Has anyone had a similar experience?
<BR>
<P>Thanks.
