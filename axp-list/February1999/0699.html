<P>Well.. the problem is that not all video cards agree with the console
<BR>
firmware (or is it the other way around?).
<BR>
<P>In fact, I had problems getting my ATI All-In-Wonder Pro to do
<BR>
ANYTHING on my PCI-64 (cabriolet) box running ARC firmware.
<BR>
<P>Hardware compatibility with the console firmware seems spotty at
<BR>
best. And although I haven't tried to plug my All-In-Wonder into my
<BR>
SX164 yet, I'm guessing that AlphaBIOS will be just as unhappy with it
<BR>
as ARC was.
<BR>
<P>Other than that, the card worked fine for 2d under Linux on my old
<BR>
Intel box. Unfortunately none of the video features work due to ATI's
<BR>
closed hardware specs, and stubborn stance on releasing those specs. 
<BR>
<P>Although Metro-X does claim to support the ATI AIW, I haven't seen any
<BR>
information which would indicate that the Metro-X server is capable of
<BR>
supporting any of the video effects. 
<BR>
<P>So, since only about 1/6th of the card's features are supported, I'd
<BR>
recommend that you save your time and get a card from a different
<BR>
manufacturer.
