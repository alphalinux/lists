<P>
With regards to your message at 05:55 PM 02-12-99 -0600, Barrett G. Lyon.
<BR>
Where you stated:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Well the timeline of events went as followed.  I installed Redhat 5.2 (pre
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ramdisk fix) on a 21164sx and it exhibited the symptoms I noted before.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sent in a bug report, and never got any email or related information back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from Redhat.  I did another install on a UDB (pre 13-Nov-1998) and had the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;same problem on that, again I sent in bug reports.  I was stuck in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lobby of a hotel today and was going though old email, and noticed that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Redhat never got back to me today, so I wrote that ignorant email to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;list and sent it out.  I'm glad to see that there was a fix for it, sorry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to make some people angry.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Take care,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;-Barrett
</EM><BR>
If it is any consolation, this was the only bug report I ever filed that
<BR>
DID get an answer!
<BR>
I was one of the ones who wrote to them before they posted the new RAMdisk.
<BR>
Once they posted the new RAMdisk I even got a follow-up email.
<BR>
<P>Since then I have posted about the DHCPCD problems, problems with mt, and a
<BR>
few others which were largely ignored..
<BR>
However, _some_ of these things DID get fixed. And some didn't.
<BR>
