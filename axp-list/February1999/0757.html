Hi!
<BR>
<P>I have a broken 4/100 and was hoping that you kind fellows might have some
<BR>
hand's on experience with one...
<BR>
<P>Symptoms:
<BR>
Power supply appears to fire up initially (looking at the 12 and 5V rails)
<BR>
after about 1/2 a second the voltages drop to a few hundred millivolts and
<BR>
the machine stays off. I tried isolating the PSU from everying else, but
<BR>
it appears to do the same thing.
<BR>
<P>I know the PSU is totally non-standard and even has a themal transducer
<BR>
of some kind on the CPU fan. Could this cause the power supply to fail -
<BR>
i.e. if it thought the CPU was too hot would the PSU shut down?
<BR>
<P>Alternatively, if it is the PSU, which I suspect it is... does anyone know
<BR>
where to get these horrible non-standard ASTEC power supplies from? And
<BR>
more hopefully... does anyone know where to get them from in the U.K? Any
<BR>
H/W dealers out there help me out?
<BR>
<P>Many thanks in advance,
<BR>
<P>Phil.
<BR>
