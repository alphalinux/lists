- the VX42 (233MHz) can be overclocked to 300MHz.  however, this is
<BR>
probably going to produce an improvement far below linear, primarily
<BR>
because of the slow memory subsystem.  (such was my experience)

<P>- i've heard that the pitifully small cache can be upgraded, but i can't
<BR>
provide any specifics on that.
<BR>
<P>- if you've got the original 24 megs or less of memory, you might want to
<BR>
get some more so that you avoid swapping.
<BR>
<P>- if you're using X, you might want to invest in a fast (but physically
<BR>
small) vga card for it, since the TGA X server is minimally accellerated.
<BR>
<P>- supposedly 2.2 kernels run visibly faster on the UDB.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2) Does anybody know relatively inexpensive sources for Alpha hardware.

<EM>&gt; Specifically, what's a good deal on a CPU/MB combo (nothing too fancy),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and what kind of case do I need (AT, ATX, something strange)?

<P>i've heard of good prices on SX motherboards and 164PCs.  supposedly
<BR>
DGCinc. is a good (=reputable &amp; affordable) place, but there are many
<BR>
others as well.
