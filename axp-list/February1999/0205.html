I wish I knew.  It seems that the premium for the 'au' also goes for a DU
<BR>
licence, but then Maurice Hillarius claims it is just for the licence to
<BR>
use the 'SRM'.  I don't understand why anyone would pay 2,500$ extra for
<BR>
the legal ability to use a boot loader, but hey, suckers are born every
<BR>
minute.
<BR>
<P>The SRM on the 'a' units seem to be fully functioning, but I have never
<BR>
seriously used mine.  Linux and BSD can boot from SRM, BSD last I heard
<BR>
doesn't boot w/o the SRM loader.
<BR>
<P>As for the End-of-life on the PWS series, doesn't the Compaq XP1000 use
<BR>
the same case?  For a price, there used to be an upgrade you can pre-order
<BR>
to get the '264 motherboard for the PWS case.  The '164 CPU is upgradabile
<BR>
according to the maintainance docs, but you don't get the frequency switch
<BR>
info unless you buy the new chip, so I think that might rule out a cheaper
<BR>
Samsung alternative.
<BR>
<P>JRDM
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	Anyhow, here is the discussion I have had with another Alpha 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enthusiast regarding the 500a: Everything I have read on the system indicates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the PWS &quot;a&quot; models are designed to run NT (and Linux, of course) and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the PWS &quot;au&quot; models are designed for Digital UNIX and OpenVMS but also can 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have ARC/abios.  In fact, I have been told numerous times that the &quot;a&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hardware is incompatible with SRM and do not ship with it as an option.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	My system has a badge on the front which clearly reads &quot;500a&quot;, yet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the system shipped with SRM as the default power-up firmware.  In fact, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the abios setup allows me to choose &quot;AlphaBIOS&quot;, &quot;Digital UNIX SRM&quot;, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;OpenVMS SRM&quot;, and &quot;ARC&quot; as default power-up modes.  Were late model 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; PWS &quot;a&quot; systems shipped with both SRM/ARC to extend the life and usefulness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the soon-to-be EOL'd PWS series, or had the capability to run both firmware
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; options been there all along?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	I find it interesting to consider, as some vendors on Usenet have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; known to charge ~$2500 more for used &quot;au&quot; system than an &quot;a&quot; system with the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same options.  
</EM><BR>
