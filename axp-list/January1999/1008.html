We are experiencing hangs of LX boxes under high SCSI disk load.
<BR>
This is the same problem that I previously reported as an
<BR>
rsync-induced crash:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.lib.uaa.alaska.edu/axp-list/archive/1998-11/0658.html">http://www.lib.uaa.alaska.edu/axp-list/archive/1998-11/0658.html</A>
<BR>
I have now seen that occurring also with rdist, so the application
<BR>
is not responsible.  In both cases I was trying to replicate
<BR>
a directory tree of about 2GB from one disk to another.
<BR>
The hangs occur randomly, usually after several minutes of intense
<BR>
disk activity.  I have seen it on two similar boxes,
<BR>
so a h/w failure is unlikely.  Under &quot;normal&quot; disk load the
<BR>
machines are doing fine and stay up for (at least) weeks.
<BR>
<P>There are no kernel messages, and a very substantial file system corruption.  
<BR>
By pressing Ctrl-ScrLock, Shift-ScrLock after the hangs (the only action
<BR>
that triggers some response from the box..) , I see that the program 
<BR>
counter points either to do_sd_request or requeue_sd_request (within 
<BR>
drivers/scsi/sd.c). Other addresses that I see in registers refer to 
<BR>
blk_dev , random_pool, all_requests.
<BR>
<P>Machine is LX 533MHz/2Mb, Adaptec AHA-294X Ultra SCSI, one
<BR>
Seagate ST39102LW (9GB) and one Fujitsu MAB3045SC (4.5GB),
<BR>
SCSI setting: Synchronous at 40.0 Mbyte/sec.
<BR>
RH 5.2, kernel 2.0.36 (from RH updates), SCSI driver AIC7XXX 5.1.4/3.2.4
<BR>
I have tried running with option aic7xxx=panic_on_abort, but the
<BR>
aic7xxx_panic_abort function is never called.
<BR>
<P>Any help would be appreciated..
<BR>
Thanks
