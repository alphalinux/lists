<P>One thing Alphas should be immune to is the corrupt the stack, add new

executable Intel code and then execute it - you'd need a special Alpha

version of the crack.

<P>Anyone who believes security through obscurity is a workable policy needs

to think again. With the modern Internet information is there for the

taking (whether it be ways of breaking into systems, material considered

pornographic in the country of viewing, bomb making recipes etc).
