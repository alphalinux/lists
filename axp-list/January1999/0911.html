Ok, after some minor hacking I got todays snap of kdebase to build and
<BR>
I'm about
<BR>
to put together some rpms. For some reason the .moc files in
<BR>
kscreensaver didn't get made so I had to moc &quot;name&quot;.h &gt; &quot;name&quot;.moc to 14
<BR>
files which was a pain. Now I thought to myself there has to be a easier
<BR>
way to do that. I need to learn perl :) They ought to be done by 11:00
<BR>
and there's a new requirement, a small one. Mesa is required for a few
<BR>
of the screensavers, There's some OpenGL ones that are pretty cool. I'll
<BR>
put Mesa up on my  site so you don't have to go looking for it.
