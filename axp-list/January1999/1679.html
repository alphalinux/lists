Uh... I'm not sure if this has anything to do with it... because I don't 
<BR>
remember if I ever uploaded my RPMs for KDE to Peter... 
<BR>
<P>Anyways... if anyone uses the RPMs on Peter's site under the directory 
<BR>
/from_designer_seven.... beware... as I've compiled very specifically 
<BR>
for my 21164a. I uploaded these to Peter as a &quot;bonus&quot; for anyone who has 
<BR>
a 21164a. You have been warned, and I won't be compiling for the older 
<BR>
machines. What you can do is get my SRPMs if you want to use what I 
<BR>
uploaded to Peter... and compile yourself.. as there is nothing in the 
<BR>
rpm.spec file that is specific to my system. It uses a RPM var called 
<BR>
RPM_OPT_FLAGS which is defined in my system in rpmrc... so as long as 
<BR>
you don't stick odd compile flags in rpmrc on your system, you should be 
<BR>
ok.
<BR>
<P>oh... and...
<BR>
<P>Don't be wrecking on my bro (Peter) yo! Kids been pumping 'em RPMs outta 
<BR>
generosity yo!
<BR>
<P>Ok.. just had to stick that in there...
<BR>
