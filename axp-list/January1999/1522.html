<EM>&gt;&gt; Especially, the very old sqrt, was that single-bit-a-time version from libfdm,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; later it was replaced by an assembler version of the method you cite. libffm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; slightly improves on that. It seems strange, that you get near those figures
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; with your C version.  It seems likely that your timing is governed by other

<EM>&gt;&gt; factors, but not (really) sqrt.

<EM>&gt;    My C routine is not the same as the code in fdlibm; it is derived

<EM>&gt;    from comments in the fdlibm code that discussed Newtons method; it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    uses floating point divides but since the Alpha was supposed to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    good at floating point arithmetic, I decided to give it a try. My
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    code also ignores all the special cases like 0, +-inf, +-NaN etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    as noted in my comments in the code.

<P>YEP, what I wanted to say, that the latest &quot;official&quot; Alpha libm sqrt
<BR>
is ALREADY based on those comments you used too. This change was done
<BR>
by Davids Mousberger already some time ago, so the differences should not be so
<BR>
large !!?? Only in the very *early* times of AXP/Linux, the single-bit version
<BR>
was used and was known to be &quot;dog slow&quot;.
