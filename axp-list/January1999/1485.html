<P>
We have experienced the following vexing problem and wonder if anyone else
<BR>
has seen something like it:
<BR>
<P>We are running a few large Fortran codes which are compiled on a DEC Alpha
<BR>
workstation running Digital UNIX V4.0B with Digital Fortran for Digital
<BR>
UNIX Alpha Systems V4.1.  The executables are copied to several Linux
<BR>
systems, each DEC Alphas running Red Hat Linux 4.1, 4.2 or 5.1.  When the
<BR>
programs are executed, we sporadically get an unexpected termination with
<BR>
the following type of message:
<BR>
<P>forrtl: severe (29): file not found, unit 8, file getwd: can't lstat
<BR>
.././LOOKOBS
<BR>
<P>where LOOKOBS is the name of a file which the Fortran program is trying to
<BR>
open.  The open statement which preceded the error is something like this:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OPEN (LUNLOOK,FILE=OUTPATH(1:IOUT)//'LOOKOBS',STATUS='UNKNOWN')
<BR>
<P>where OUTPATH(1:IOUT)='./'
<BR>
<P>The error happens with different files but always while opening an output
<BR>
file.  The same programs happily open and write to these same files
<BR>
successfully MANY times on previous program runs before generating this
<BR>
error. The relative filename given in these error messages (.././LOOKOBS)
<BR>
actually appears to be wrong, one directory above where the Fortran code
<BR>
says it should be.  But the program routinely opens the file in the right
<BR>
place, so we think the relative pathname is being mangled by the system
<BR>
somehow.
<BR>
<P>When the error occurs, it can usually be replicated a few times, but
<BR>
generally the error will go away if any files are removed or altered in the
<BR>
directory where the program is running, even if the removed or altered
<BR>
files are unrelated to the one which was not successfully opened.
<BR>
<P>It doesn't really seem to us like a Fortran or data problem, but rather
<BR>
just flaky behavior somehow related to the fact that we compile with
<BR>
Digital Fortran on a DEC Alpha, then run the executables on a DEC Alpha
<BR>
running Linux.  When we run the same programs on Alphas running Digital
<BR>
Unix, the problem never occurs.  Does anyone have any insight into what the
<BR>
&quot;getwd: can't lstat&quot; message might be indicating?
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
