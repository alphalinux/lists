<P>
I am having problems getting my Multia configured for my monitor so I
<BR>
can use SRM. I have looked all over the net for docs on how to set the
<BR>
jumpers to reduce the video mode to something my old monitor can handle,
<BR>
but I couldn't find any more than what was already in the Digital
<BR>
service manual. I know I need to set jumpers W3 - W6, but nothing tells
<BR>
where they are on the board and which one is which. I would rather not
<BR>
resort to trial/error as an error could mean a nuked monitor. Has anyone
<BR>
ever set these jumpers before and could tell me how to do it?
<BR>
<P>Also, when I bought this machine (internal SCSI), I was under the
<BR>
impression that the reason why the external SCSI version has no room for
<BR>
an internal drive is that it uses the pci riser to allow a full size
<BR>
external SCSI card to be mounted horizontally. In other words, I
<BR>
erroneously thought the external SCSI version has no PCI expansion
<BR>
capabilities and that is why I bought this one instead. I have had this
<BR>
thing for more than 30 days so I doubt if I can exchange it through CPU
<BR>
Micromart. Has anyone else been dumb enough to get stuck in this
<BR>
situation and gotten out of it with minimal financial loss? Is soldering
<BR>
a PCI socket onto the card a viable option? What about ditching the SCSI
<BR>
card altogether and using a PCMCIA one instead? Does Linux support such
<BR>
things? Should I just buy a new external SCSI Multia instead? I really
<BR>
need a PCI slot in this thing badly!
<BR>
<P>Thanks for any help anyone can give me on these two problems!
<BR>
