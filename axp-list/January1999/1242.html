<P>
<EM>&gt;    I've been salivating over getting an alpha workstation for some years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now.  
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ditto that.  The stability of Linux/axp was a prohibitive factor
<BR>
for me a couple years ago when considering a system from Aspen.  To the
<BR>
credit of Linux/axp stability, Linus is running an Alpha (600/xxx) at home
<BR>
alongside his other toys.  In general, software will be of higher quality
<BR>
if the developers have to rely on it's proper operation to get work done.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; My work is frequently heavily math intensive, especially with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; floating point.  Now I'm very seriously considering making the switch, and
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds like my work as well.  My platform of choice for
<BR>
fp-intensive things is SGI (8 processor Origin2000, 4 processor Onyx2) or
<BR>
a cluster of 40 or so Suns simply because that's what we have available at
<BR>
work.  
<BR>
<EM>&gt; have been investigating prices and options from various Linux-friendly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vendors.  Looking at the prices, I'm starting to wonder if it is really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;worth it&quot;.  I could build a 400 mhz K6-based system w/ SCSI and lots of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RAM for probably $1000.  The basic Alpha system I'm looking at (533 mhz
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not sure what PC vendor you are referring to, but the lowest price
<BR>
I could come up with for a K6/400 system with 256M/9G UW-SCSI disk
<BR>
subsystem lay around $1600 without monitor.  Guess I just choose not to
<BR>
skimp when it comes to designing a personal system.  
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the Intel Pentium III) in the office for about 6 months now, and they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are a joke.  It's time for x86 to leave my desktop.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My chips lay with the AMD K7 if/when it is released.  One thing
<BR>
that really sickens me is that from an architectural perspective, x86 has
<BR>
not changed much at all in the two decades since the 8086.  They refine
<BR>
the fab process, crank it up to higher speeds, add marketing buzzword this
<BR>
and that functionality but in reality, nothing new is to be found under
<BR>
the sun. 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;    I've been following the threads about people &quot;reventing&quot; back to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; x86, and it sounds like there's argument either way.  What I was hoping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for it to get those same people to give some specifics as to why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one or the other is better.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Linux/x86 user community is many times larger than the
<BR>
Linux/axp community.  For that reason, the x86 people get the latest
<BR>
greatest candy first in the Linux world.  No bones about it, x86 is where 
<BR>
you want to be if you cannot do without someone to hold your hand and walk
<BR>
you through problems.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 3D acceleartion will finally be a reality for the Alpha.  (Currently I do all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my stuff on the 3dfx series of 3d accelerators, but from the looks of it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Glide is not going to make it to the Alpha anytime soon.  A true shame.)
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metrolink's Extreme3D product will be released for Linux/axp
<BR>
probably within one month.  Until that time, I'll gladly use their MetroX
<BR>
server (what is it, $30 now?).   
<BR>
<EM>&gt;    So - is it worth it?  Will I see enough of a speedup from a (say) PII-266
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to a 21164-533?  What about from a PII-450 to a 21164-533?  Better yet, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what's going to make the difference in speed - would it be better to go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up in mhz (say, to 600 or more) or to get a motherboard with more cache?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm already planning on UW-SCSI and at least 256 megs of RAM, of course.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are comparing apples and oranges.  Read my last post regarding
<BR>
benchmarking.  It really, really (really, folks!) depends on what your
<BR>
application is.  For floating-point intensive code, the Alpha will win
<BR>
hands down when pitted against a P2/266 - especially on large matrix
<BR>
manipulations or bitonic searches. But compared to a P2/450, I can't
<BR>
really say.  Don't have one running Linux to compare it to.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For other things, the x86 may win over the Alpha.  The best thing
<BR>
to do is find a friend with an x86 system like the one you might build
<BR>
and one with an Alpha like you might purchase.  Bring along your code,
<BR>
compile on both, and compare side-by-side.  Spend a couple hours in front
<BR>
of each one.  Contrary to what the marketing droids want you to believe,
<BR>
system performance comparison is a highly technical art and not one which
<BR>
can be summarized by spec95foobar and specbob this and that.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's my over-generalized concluding comparison.  If you want
<BR>
compatibility with the rest of the Linux/GNU world 100% of the time, play
<BR>
a lot of games, and cannot do without DOS or Windows applications, x86 is
<BR>
the only way to go.  At least at the present time.  If you code in your
<BR>
sleep, can stand portability problems and fix them, and your fp-intensive
<BR>
code runs faster on the Alpha - go with the Alpha.
