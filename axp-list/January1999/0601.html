Hello,
<BR>
<P>Just crashed my machine (doing something stupid), so I hit reset, and
<BR>
did something bad to my /usr partition.  When coming up, it got to
<BR>
&quot;/dev/hda4 contains errors, check forced&quot; and then something like
<BR>
&quot;UNEXPECTED ERROR in /dev/hda4.\nEnter root password for maintenance or
<BR>
hid Ctrl-D to continue startup&quot;.
<BR>
<P>I tried the root password about five times, and each time not only did
<BR>
it not work, it shut down and rebooted.
<BR>
<P>So, I tried ^D, which shut down and rebooted- twice.
<BR>
<P>The third time, I accidentally hit ^C instead, which dumped my to the
<BR>
login screen.  Cool.  But I could not log in as root- it would quickly
<BR>
flash a bunch of lines starting with &quot;do_ypcall&quot; to the effect that the
<BR>
network was unreachable, and then dump back to the login screen.  And
<BR>
all of the users are via NIS, so of course it didn't recognize any
<BR>
usernames/passwords.  Uncool.
<BR>
<P>So, I shut down and rebooted from the RedHat 5.1 emergency disk and
<BR>
ramdisk, which brings me into the installer.  Unfortunately, unlike the
<BR>
Intel version (or LinuxPPC for that matter) which I've used more
<BR>
recently, there is no shell console, so I have no way to run e2fsck!
<BR>
<P>So I am stuck.  Is there anything I can do aside from a total
<BR>
reinstall?  Is there anyway to break the installer so it dumps me to a
<BR>
shell?
<BR>
<P>Zeen,
<BR>
