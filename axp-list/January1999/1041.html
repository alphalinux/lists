<P>
Dear AlphaLinuxCommunitee,
<BR>
<P>What are the recommendation for securing (as much as is reasonable
<BR>
(whateverthatmeans)) our new alpha linux (redhat 5.2)?  Any
<BR>
recommendations concerning firewalls etc... would be appreciated.
<BR>
<P>Thanks in advance.
<BR>
<P>Iraj.

<P><EM>&gt; I have to say, I almost totally agree with you. The part about risk 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assessment (just rephrasing what you seem to be saying), and compromise 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; between services and security... well said. Also, the part about 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; physical security.... very true too.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, as anyone working in the security field would know, these days, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the philosophy of &quot;security thru obscurity&quot; simply carries too high of a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; risk, even if you're protecting yourself from so called &quot;kiddie 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scripts.&quot; (i've personally never heard of that phrase) With all the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information available on the internet, and the ease of access these 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; days, the kid in the garage cracker can easily go beyond using a few 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well known hacks. It's easy enough to find step-by-step instructions on 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; building a bomb on the internet, is it that much harder to go beyond 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some simple scripted attacks?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, even though I have no statistics to prove anything (nor do 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; statistics necessarily prove anything)... but the increase number of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attacks in the past few years (mostly proportional to the increase 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; population on the net)... should also raise a few concerns. You now have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a greater population of crackers, this could mean many things. First, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you should suspect that you have a greater variety of cracker 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personalities (if you're profiling your attacker). This could mean very 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; persistent and intelligent kids. Second, collaborative cracking 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attacks... this we've seen quite a bit last year already. With such 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; collaborative efforts, do you think they will all simply use scripted 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attacks? With the exchange of ideas and methods, I would think they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could easily go beyond your simple scripted attacks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, some of the recent attacks I'm aware of involve sniffers. So even 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you're on an Alpha, if you run something like telnet, or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; non-anonymous ftp with a user account over a public network, you're 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; screwed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; About a year ago, I had just gotten a cable modem service, and was 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; running a windows 95 box on it. I had ftp running so that I could 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transfer files from work with an non-anonymous account, with user and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; password different from my higher security accounts. I just wanted to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keep warez people from uploading to every anonymous ftp site, but still 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be able to ftp myself a few files from work (low security docs).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well one day, someone somehow was able to execute a change in the win95 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; registry remotely, subsequently gaining anonymous ftp access. They then 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; uploaded an executable containing a virus. And that was it... clearly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the work of some kid screwing around. Fortunately, I never executed the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; virus, and during a standard virus scan, it was found and deleted. I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; later checked my logs and via some social engineering with the ISP, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; found out it was some college kid living in southern california. I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contacted the kid to tell him I knew it was him, he got a little scared, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and was surprised that anyone could track him down. He apologized, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; almost sounding like he pissed in his pants... so I figure it was enough 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and since no real damage was done, nor did i have anything important on 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my win95 box, I let him go... actually, he and I keep in touch and are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more or less buddies. Anyways, the point is, your typical college kid 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; found some way to change the win95 registry remotely... that to me is a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pretty sofisticated attack... well, at least it still beats me as to how 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he did that. I've never seen this attack in the standard security 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bulletins... maybe I missed something, but at least to me, this is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beyond running a few standard scripts.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ok.. this is getting way off topic... anyone wanting to discuss security 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with me, just email me directly,... I think I've had enough of this 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discussion on the list.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; D.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;Why Alpha?  A couple of my development projects need 64bit support.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;Most of the rest is security thru obscurity -- few to none of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;script kiddie hacks work on Alphas (they rely on one or more of x86,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;little-endian, 32bit).  This lets me be a little more sloppy in my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;security maintenance and still keep a working system on the public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;Internet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;There has been a little debate on the list lately becuse of this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;statement. I'll defend it too :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;It is sort of true that using an Alpha over Intel is security through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;obscurity. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;However, I'll tell you what .. if I wanted root on most anyone's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;bad enough, I could probably get it.. even people that follow CERT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;religiously and who patch every known hole in the software and OS.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;How? The hardware is probably insecure. I walk into your house, sit at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the console and boot to a floppy. I have root. I mount your partition,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;change /etc/shadow, and reboot. You are hosed. If you have a BIOS 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; password
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;it'll take me a few more minutes to pull the CMOS RAM battery .. but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;if I have the console, I basically have root. Most people have little, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;any, home security. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Now, I don't want to get off on a security tangent here.. but this is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;parallel to Intel/Alpha security issues.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Most attackers who will break into your home don't give a crap about 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; root.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;They'll take the machine itself, pawn it off and they don't need root. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Most attackers who want root, won't break into your home. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Therefore to keep someone from getting root on your box, you don't need 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;live on a military base and keep your machine in a bank vault. Physical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;compromise isn't a likely attack scenario for most people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Similarly, for many servers, scripted attacks are the only ones they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to worry about. For the guys that can get into any box because they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; write
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the scripts to begin with, they will have more interesting targets. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;aren't in the attack scenario.. script kiddies running around with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;new 0-day DoS attack are the ones that will likely hit your machine. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Using an Alpha stops them. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If you're protecting nuclear launch codes, you're working in a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;model .. if you're just trying to run a box to keep a smooth internet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;connection going, and don't necessarily have secrets to hide, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protecting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;from script kiddies is fine, so long as you don't make for yourself 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;intelligent enemies and change your threat model all around again.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Myself, I have known vunerabilities in software that I use. I accept 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;vunerabilities because the only two users of the machine are myself and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;a trusted friend (who has root via sudo anyhow .. so if he really wants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to get flashy and get a root shell through a 'sploit instead .. who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;cares?). So, I don't worry about local attacks .. instead I keep remote
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;access tied down. SSH happens to be the only way in from unknown 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; networks,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and telnet w/ OPIE is as good as it gets for trusted networks.. all 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;daemons are firewalled. And, really, OPIE would be good enough for me 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;but I like playing with crypto so I set SSH up just to do it. A 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;threat model than if I had a hundred and twenty users to worry about.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Real security is about balancing use vs. security.. because, if you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pursue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&quot;security&quot; (paranoia is a better word) fully, you'll bury your box 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;30 feet of concrete and steel with no network connection and no users 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;even yourself). Because as long as there _is_ a way in, there is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;possibility for unauthorized access. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;It's all about threats and acceptable models for an application, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; folks..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;not some imaginary end of &quot;absolute security&quot; .. it doesn't exist.. for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;reasons closely tied to stuff like Godel's Incompleteness Theorem or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Turing's Halting Problem.. its just something you have to live with.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Now, I better cover this now, because someone invariably says it .. the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;OTP is an absolutably secure cryptosystem, yes. But an OTP doesn't help
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;you when an attacker takes some .. compromising pictures .. of your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;secretary or attorney, or .... and gets her to steal the pad. Its only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;absolutably secure in a given model, namely in a model where 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eavesdropping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;on the ciphertext and even some (or all) knowledge of the plaintext is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the only attacks. An OTP gives no message authentication .. if you're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;worried about that sort of thing, you need to use a MAC too.. it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;help against bribery or torture. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;You have to pick your likely threats.
