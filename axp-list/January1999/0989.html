Hmm... I can see that certain hacks being architecture dependant, but 
<BR>
what does little-endian have to do with it? I mean, I know byte ordering 
<BR>
is significant in the tcp/ip implementation, but AFAIK, Linux/Alpha is 
<BR>
little-endian anyway... I don't know about Digital Unix though?
<BR>
<P>However, without proof, and mere speculation, I would think that 
<BR>
software ported over from Intel to Alpha are likely to have a higher 
<BR>
risk of having security holes. Although, the fact that more people have 
<BR>
Intels than Alphas, probably correlates to more security holes being 
<BR>
discovered on Intel than on Alpha. However, if many experienced 
<BR>
hackers/security professionals concentrated on finding holes in  Alpha 
<BR>
systems, I would tend to think that they'd find equally as many holes, 
<BR>
if not more.
<BR>
<P>I guess my point is, security through obscurity is not a philosophy I 
<BR>
would go by... at least not these days... when people can find bargain 
<BR>
deals on systems of most architectures... I got my deals on systems of most architectures... I got my 21164a@500Mhz for 
<BR>
$500... cheaper than my most of my Intel machines.
<BR>
<P>D. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Why Alpha?  A couple of my development projects need 64bit support.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Most of the rest is security thru obscurity -- few to none of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;script kiddie hacks work on Alphas (they rely on one or more of x86,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;little-endian, 32bit).  This lets me be a little more sloppy in my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;security maintenance and still keep a working system on the public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Internet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You are exactly right on the security side. Over Christmas one of my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;customers at a university had _most_ of their systems hacked ( yes 
</EM><BR>
their
<BR>
<EM>&gt;security was lousy) but not their alpha boxen.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Since then they have certainly improved their overall network security, 
</EM><BR>
but
<BR>
<EM>&gt;it proves exactly what you are saying. The tools hacked into the boxes 
</EM><BR>
were
<BR>
<EM>&gt;meant for x86 platforms, and basically did nothing to the alphas but 
</EM><BR>
create
<BR>
<EM>&gt;some interesting log messages, which were apparently quite useful for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;determining what had been switched on the rest..  ;^}
