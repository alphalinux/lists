<P>
Ric,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I went out and looked at it, and it looks like it will do the job.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I also go t recomendations for the ipop server in the imap rpm that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comes with RedHat 5.2   Any thoughts on that one?
</EM><BR>
<P>Hummm . . . IMAP -vs- POP3 services is hotly debated.  Do you want to do
<BR>
folders and other pleasantries or do you want to stick to simple
<BR>
store-and-forward mail services?  It's a matter of choice and a matter of
<BR>
customer needs.  Either will do the job.  What's your preference?
<BR>
<P>How about trying out both and do some stress testing to see which works
<BR>
well with Linux and your hardware.  I can tell you that qpopper can take a
<BR>
huge number of hits per minute and thrive.  It's performance will soley
<BR>
depend on the hardware.  I used a HP 9000 D-350 (dual 101 Mhz) with a 20
<BR>
GB RAID 5 system and it served 3,000 business users, sending monster
<BR>
attachments, nicely.  That same system also handled 170 majordomo mailing
<BR>
lists, Xtacacs router authenication services, the primary domain ftp site,
<BR>
the primary private DNS, 2 apache Intranet web sites, primary router
<BR>
config storage and retrieval site, and more.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; At any rate, I installed qpopper (piece of cake), and it's working
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; great! Thanks again!
</EM><BR>
<P>No problem.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now if I can get Windoze to quit with the d*mn encrypted paswords, my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life with that and samba will be a lot happier too!  (grin!  I Know how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to do it.. Its just a pain, and I'm dodging it... :)  
</EM><BR>
<P>HA HA HA HA!!!
<BR>
<P>Enjoy!
<BR>
<P>Paul
