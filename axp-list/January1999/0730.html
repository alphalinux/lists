</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the compiler also doesn't have buffer limitations, so it can look at much

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;(particularly on the alpha), it will always help to have a better

<EM>&gt; &gt;compiler.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's not allways true, since at runtime the processor might know
<BR>
what a conditional branch will do, while at compile time you might 
<BR>
have no idea. 
<BR>
Also the time that is needed for some instructions is not known at compile
<BR>
time. So at run time the processor could execute instruction while waiting
<BR>
for a load or fpdiv. (Given of course there are no dependencys and there
<BR>
are execution units left.) 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For example, does anybody know how gcc for Ultrasparc (latest version, can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tell the exact code in the moment) compared to the original manufacturers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compiler rates ?? This is interesting, because only recently the 2nd real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 64-bit Linux was starting to materialize, Ultralinux 64 for Ultrasparc. From
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what I read, the Ultrasparc CPU, highest version, is a heavily out-of-order and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; register-renaming and ... CPU. Anybody got some details on benchmarks for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; both compilers ??
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
I have made some test with egcs and ultrasparc-II and alpha EV56 cpus. 
<BR>
I think that they have nearly the same problems. I tested two very little
<BR>
pices of code and while on both cpus the compiler edmitted the same
<BR>
instructions, the scheduling was different given a 100 % time
<BR>
difference. 
<BR>
<P>On this test egcs was giving the fastest code, followed by the Sun Pro C 
<BR>
compiler and gcc was slowest.
