<EM>&gt; If this patch does fix a genuine prblems, why hasnt it been

<EM>&gt; included in the newer glibc distributions (not a dig, just wondering).
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From what I know it was included.  I looked at sources.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Has anyone in here had sucess with mysql, or is the patch suitable for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my glibc (2.0.7, the patch states 2.0.5c).

<P>(2.0.7 is not sufficient identification; there was a number of
<BR>
diffrent &quot;subvariants&quot; of this library distributed by Red Hat.)
<BR>
<P>I had mysql running on Alpha last summer at least in such state that
<BR>
it was completing its own bench/test suite and not crashing on its
<BR>
own 'crashme' test.  I heard later that these executables still had
<BR>
some trouble spots and that this was due to problems with thread
<BR>
support in a kernel.  (BIG WARNING - this is a second-hand knowledge
<BR>
provided without details which would allow to verify these claims!).
<BR>
Apparently using some development kernels would be beneficial.
<BR>
You may want to check some of the current 2.2.0pre kernels.  They
<BR>
do not require any Alpha specific patches to compile.  For
<BR>
2.2.0pre4-ac1 there is only one, really trivial to fix, &quot;gotcha&quot;.
<BR>
<P>If this would really resolve your troubles then likely other people
<BR>
on this list would like to know.
