<EM>&gt; Cool!  As a professional Support Geek(tm), I have to ask:  What was the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resolution of your freelist complaint?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well I fsck'ed the drive while it was mounted (who do you do a fsck
<BR>
without mounting / ?) and it warned me it was mounted etc etc and I went
<BR>
ahead. I took sooo long after about 5 mins I got tired of it and put my
<BR>
head down leaving my finger on the return key :) After another 5-10 mins
<BR>
it was done and said it moved lots of stuff to lost+found. It looked
<BR>
like nothing so I deleted it. Everything seemed fine for awhile, then I
<BR>
started to install rpms. Same damn error and rpm wouldn't enter the pack
<BR>
in it's database which meant I couldn't uninstall it. What do I have to
<BR>
do to fix my drive and mantain it.Thanks.
<BR>
