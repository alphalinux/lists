<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;The design is different, so for optimal performance you need to optimize for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;EV6.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This is STILL pretty puzzling. Weren't we told that EV6 will be/is so much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; more &quot;brains&quot; that is nearly automatically optimizes instruction sequence(s)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and register usage (e.g. register renaming etc.) that optimizing code
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; already by the compiler is much less critical than on ev5(6) ??
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 21264 is the first alpha which supports out-of-order execution. what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this means, roughly, is that within a group of instructions fetched
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from memory, if the first one is still waiting on a dependancy (e.g. a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; load instruction -- slow!), it can go ahead and take the next 4
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instructions in line, and come back to the first one once the dependancy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is satisfied.  the 21164 and previous would simply wait until the first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instruction is ready to execute, doing nothing in the meantime.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; however, the processor still has to ensure that the execution behaves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exactly as if the instructions were executed in their specified order.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imagine trying to keep track of many in-flight instructions and once and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complete them all in-order by hand ... it is not a simple task!  (i've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; done it)  so, while the 21264 is much more flexible in execution than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 21164, it still has very little knowledge to work with.  by contrast, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compiler knows much more about what instructions are interchangeable, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the compiler also doesn't have buffer limitations, so it can look at much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; larger sections of code in order to re-order instructions.  that is why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (particularly on the alpha), it will always help to have a better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compiler.
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe the 264 is capable of examining on the order of
<BR>
60 asm instructions to decide what to do. That will fix
<BR>
most of the stalls one sees using 164's. I would expect
<BR>
a 21164 optimized binary would run well on the 264. The
<BR>
21164 binary would already have the non-variable stuff
<BR>
removed from critical loops so it has reasonable inner
<BR>
loops, at least from what I've seen comparing my FORTRAN
<BR>
to it's generated asm. It's not perfect, but it isn't
<BR>
bad and the ability to look that far ahead should do
<BR>
wonders. Assuming egcs has 264 scheduling added, it 
<BR>
will help to re-compile at that point.
<BR>
<P>Re-compile would also be necessary to get any new instructions
<BR>
though. Still would need egcs support for them.
