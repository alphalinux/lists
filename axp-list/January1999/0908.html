Hi Peter and everyone,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; An interesting disscussion went on today at the alphant mailing list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that somehow got on the topic of DU. Turns out that DEC/Compaq is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; planning to release a C/C++ compiler for alphalinux. Can anyone else
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; verify this? This would solve our mozzila problems in one shot. It would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also make porting DU applications like the JDK to alphalinux easy. See
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; below.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is great news, providing it is true.  Compaq needs to be
<BR>
aware and considerate to those in the academic community, be they
<BR>
researchers, students, teachers, etc. if/when pursuing the option of C/C++
<BR>
compilers for AlphaLinux.  As a student and a staff member in an academic
<BR>
institution, I would be more than willing to pay for compilers to speed up
<BR>
simulations using floating-point intensive algorithms.  After all, the
<BR>
excellent floating point performance of the Alpha processor was the
<BR>
motivation for buying a DEC system for me.  It is worth the 20%-30%
<BR>
average speedup - but only at a reasonable price or preferably, free for
<BR>
hobbyist and non-commercial users.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEC has traditionally led the charge into the free software arena; 
<BR>
as I recall, it was DEC who among the major workstation vendors supported
<BR>
the first port of Linux to a non-x86 architecture when such projects were
<BR>
unheard of.  What disappoints me about the SGI and Sun Linux support
<BR>
is that (as I understand it), they will only fund development to the point
<BR>
where it is bootable on their systems.  And not that the attitude is
<BR>
technically wrong - after all, any other stance would be a conflict
<BR>
between the marketing and technical divisions of Sun and SGI.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compaq should seriously consider the historical precedent-setting
<BR>
activities of Digital and set another by fully supporting and enhancing
<BR>
Linux on one of the most elegant architectures out there today.  As I
<BR>
recall, Compaq has pledged to supporting Linux on their x86 server
<BR>
systems.  To continue open support for the AlphaLinux project appears a
<BR>
natural outgrowth of that initial pledge.
<BR>
<P>Best regards and looking forward to an official annoucement,
<BR>
Daniel
