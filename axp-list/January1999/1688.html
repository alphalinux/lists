<EM>&gt; If one were to build a Alpha machine for use as a graphics machine, what 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; components would one use that are currently available on the market??
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of my work involves number crunching, although the system I 
<BR>
just purchased should be able to carry it's weight graphics-wise.  
<BR>
After all, the video system is the business end of most modern systems.
<BR>
Chose a Permedia2-based card, specifically the Diamond FireGL 1000 Pro with
<BR>
8M of vid ram.  Depending on your timeframe of purchase, I would wait until
<BR>
the release of XiG's hardware-accelerated OpenGL server and/or 
<BR>
Metrolink's Extreme3D product to see which chipsets the final versions
<BR>
support. (www.metrolink.com, www.xig.com) 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I assume CPU would be 21264... ideally
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Push for a large cache.  Depending on your budget, I would even 
<BR>
go for 4M or 8M of cache.  You'll find that when manipulating large, 
<BR>
complex datasets and images, the large cache will be most appreciated.
<BR>
A good compromise might be 4M of cache and 256-512M of ram.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; But what graphics card? What software is available that would use 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specialized hardware? And just for fun, what monitor?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XiG's product and Metrolink's Extreme3D will support some 
<BR>
high-end ($700-$1500) cards, if money is no object.  As far as monitors  
<BR>
go, I plan to order a Hitachi 753 on Monday - earlier models of the same
<BR>
series have won numerous awards.  I think your &quot;bro&quot;, Peter, will agree with 
<BR>
me on this recommendation (he's thinking of buying the same thing :-) 
<BR>
If money is no object, go for a 21&quot; Viewsonic or Sony (500PS?). 
<BR>
(search out Dejanews for links to various reviews)
<BR>
<EM>&gt; How would the ideal Alpha based graphics machine (exclude clustering) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compare with a SGI?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How would you compare apples to watermelons? My 500a, with the
<BR>
Permedia2 card running at Permedia2 card running at 1024x768@32bpp with XFree86, runs the 
<BR>
OpenGL &quot;ideas&quot; demo at nearly the same framerate as our SGI O2's.  
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I am about to get a few more alphas ... either to build a graphics 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machine or to sell off.... so I'd appreciate any recommendations, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most of all references... Thanks
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I can only speak from my own experience.  Hopefully my
<BR>
experience with graphics will only get better with the hardware accelerated
<BR>
OpenGL servers.  
<BR>
<P>Good luck,
<BR>
Daniel
