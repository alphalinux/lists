<P>
<EM>&gt;Not all of these points are always required (not all exploits are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stack overflows, and some stack bugs have other weaknesses), however
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;almost all published exploits depends on at least one of these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;requirements, and in particular (for Linux) depends on x86, 32bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and big endian.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Hmmm... I thought that x86 was little endian, the same as Alpha.  I think
<BR>
this is the case as Windows NT uses little endian on x86 and Alpha systems.
<BR>
I really don't know how many system types are big-endian, but I read that
<BR>
HP-UX will be the main (only?) OS that will operate the still-vaporous
<BR>
IA-64 in big endian mode.  I'm still waiting for the '264 systems become
<BR>
less vaporous (more common) so that I can buy a faster '164 chip in a few
<BR>
months.
<BR>
<P>I'm getting th idea that everyone is reinforcing the idea that security
<BR>
through obscurity is not a reliable notion.  It should only be used as an
<BR>
additional sandwall of an otherwise viable security setup.
<BR>
<P>Now can we _PLEASE_ kill this thread?  Either the machine, if truly for
<BR>
sale, has been sold or will not be for various reasons.  As for the
<BR>
security debate, I don't think there is much debate anymore, it seems that
<BR>
there is little new to be said now.
<BR>
<P>Of course I could be off my rocker in any point that I gave here, so if I
<BR>
am incorrect, I don't mind corrections.
<BR>
<P>Thank you.
