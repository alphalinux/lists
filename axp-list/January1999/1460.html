I compiled the new kernel 2.20 on my AS 200 and it at first impression the
<BR>
programs seem to start faster.
<BR>
However, I have a problem and a half. My full problem is that I cannot make
<BR>
it work and retrieve an IP through DHCP. Under 2.035 at boot time I get
<BR>
something like:
<BR>
using dhtp for eth0... eth0: media is TP
<BR>
done.
<BR>
<P>Under the new kernel I get:
<BR>
using dhtp for eth0...
<BR>
failed.
<BR>
<P><P>My half-problem is with sound support. I get sound support but the sound
<BR>
volume is lower than the sound volume under 2.035.
<BR>
<P><P>I had problems configuring certain options under make config under both
<BR>
networking and sound support, because they are different than they were
<BR>
under 2.035. Therefore, I decided to try a make oldconfig, using my 2.035's
<BR>
config file. That was the worst experiment for the kernel panicked. I tried
<BR>
to fool around with the card support and did two more compiles, both of
<BR>
which had working sound but no DHTP boot up.
<BR>
<P>Remarkably, I could not find these options:
<BR>
<P>CONFIG_NET_PCI (and I assumed that it has been replaced by CONFIG_NET_EISA)
<BR>
CONFIG_MSS (and I assumed that it has been replaced by CONFIG_SOUND_MSS)
<BR>
CONFIG_AUDIO (and I assumed that it has been replaced by CONFIG_SOUND_OSS)
<BR>
DSP_BUFFSIZE=65536 (no assumptions about this one)
<BR>
<P>Does anybody know what the problem with my compilation may be?
<BR>
Does anybody have a .config that works for a stock AS 200 (with a Matrox
<BR>
Millennium Card)?
<BR>
<P>Thank you very much,
<BR>
