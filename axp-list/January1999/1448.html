<P>
<EM>&gt; This is a bit confusing. Already for some time, the &quot;official&quot; libm on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AXP/Linux **IS** based on fdlibdm !!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Especially, the very old sqrt, was that single-bit-a-time version from libfdm,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; later it was replaced by an assembler version of the method you cite. libffm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slightly improves on that. It seems strange, that you get near those figures
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with your C version.  It seems likely that your timing is governed by other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; factors, but not (really) sqrt.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My C routine is not the same as the code in fdlibm; it is derived
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from comments in the fdlibm code that discussed Newtons method; it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uses floating point divides but since the Alpha was supposed to be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good at floating point arithmetic, I decided to give it a try. My
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;code also ignores all the special cases like 0, +-inf, +-NaN etc.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as noted in my comments in the code.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;From your code, I get about 303 ns/sqrt. However, the raw libffm speed of sqrt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is about 120 ns !!
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My code includes calls to rand() in the timing loop but since I was
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only interested in comparing two versions of sqrt() on the same
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;platform, I didn't worry about it. For absolute timing or for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cross-platform comparisons, the rand() call needs to be taken out
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the timing loop as other respondents have noted.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took the rand() call out and now I get something like this:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y = 666667166.458800, time = 1.877930 secs. [sqrt]    &lt;-- libm
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y = 666667166.458800, time = 0.292969 secs. [sqt]
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y = 666667166.458800, time = 0.146484 secs. [sqrt]    &lt;-- libffm
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y = 666667166.458800, time = 0.293945 secs. [sqt]
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This yields a figure of 146 ns for the libffm sqrt() which is close
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to your expectation and almost 13 times faster than the stock libm!
<BR>
