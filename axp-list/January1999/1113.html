<P>
We got into Alphas because we are developing software for 64 bit
<BR>
processors and were using MIPS R10000s on an SGI Challenge box.  We had
<BR>
some money around and the owners of the SGI were complaining that we
<BR>
were hogging a whole CPU with our experiments so we decided to get
<BR>
ourselves a 64 bit machine.  The Alpha took a long time to arrive and to
<BR>
say sorry the company gave us a 166 UDB which I took home to replace my
<BR>
tired old Sparc 1 and 486/33.  Compared to those two it flies!
<BR>
<P>Contrary to other comments I don't have anything other than alpha and I
<BR>
do everything on it.  Code development, web browsing (Mozilla, kfm,
<BR>
lynx), document preparation (LateX, LyX), firewalling, SAMBA (for a
<BR>
demonstration Win95 laptop install which I never ever use for real work,
<BR>
an OS which crashes when I try to print something while web browsing? 
<BR>
Please!), molecular modelling (Roger Sayle of Rasmol fame used to work
<BR>
in my lab), apache and so on.
<BR>
<P>There are some programs which only run on Intel but that will change, I
<BR>
just bought Applix for the UDB because my wife uses it for club
<BR>
secretary work and I am very pleased with it.  If other companies see
<BR>
that Applix can sell commercially onto the Alpha then we should see
<BR>
other stuff arriving.
<BR>
<P>The alpha is a platform that deserves Linux, Intel gets it by shear
<BR>
weight of numbers.
