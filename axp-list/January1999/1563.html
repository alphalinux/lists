<P>
I have read that the &quot;UNIX&quot; clock's mechanism of counting the seconds
<BR>
since January 1, 1970 will exceed the range of the 32 bit field used to
<BR>
store it on January 19, 2038 at 3:14:07.
<BR>
<P>Now, that can be &quot;fixed&quot; by updating the time field to 64 bits, but that
<BR>
of course causes problems unless all the C libs, data, and applications
<BR>
that query the date are also updated.
<BR>
<P>I was thinking that perhaps I'd set my Alpha's clock to Jan. 1, 2038
<BR>
3:14:00 and watch what happened 10 seconds later, but then I decided that
<BR>
that's probably playing with fire.  (I determined, when RH 5.1 set my date
<BR>
to 2018, and once to 2035 that Linux/Alpha is Y2K compliant, but that's
<BR>
not the same as 2038.)
<BR>
<P>So, instead I'm asking a few questions of you gurus out there:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* does Linux/Alpha already use a 64 bit time field? (I'm guessing not,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as that would probably introduce incompatibilities)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* how big is the hardware clock field in Alpha mainboards (in my case,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SX164), and what would happen to my hardware if I were to set the date
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to something untoward?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* how much of a nuisance is this going to be (i.e. updating the kernel
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and glibc) come 2038?
<BR>
<P>I'm not especially worried, partly because it's still 40 years away, but
<BR>
mostly because this is precisely the sort of thing open source is good at
<BR>
flushing out, but I thought I'd ask anyway.
