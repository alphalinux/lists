<P>
I have to say, I almost totally agree with you. The part about risk 
<BR>
assessment (just rephrasing what you seem to be saying), and compromise 
<BR>
between services and security... well said. Also, the part about 
<BR>
physical security.... very true too.
<BR>
<P>However, as anyone working in the security field would know, these days, 
<BR>
the philosophy of &quot;security thru obscurity&quot; simply carries too high of a 
<BR>
risk, even if you're protecting yourself from so called &quot;kiddie 
<BR>
scripts.&quot; (i've personally never heard of that phrase) With all the 
<BR>
information available on the internet, and the ease of access these 
<BR>
days, the kid in the garage cracker can easily go beyond using a few 
<BR>
well known hacks. It's easy enough to find step-by-step instructions on 
<BR>
building a bomb on the internet, is it that much harder to go beyond 
<BR>
some simple scripted attacks?
<BR>
<P>Also, even though I have no statistics to prove anything (nor do 
<BR>
statistics necessarily prove anything)... but the increase number of 
<BR>
attacks in the past few years (mostly proportional to the increase 
<BR>
population on the net)... should also raise a few concerns. You now have 
<BR>
a greater population of crackers, this could mean many things. First, 
<BR>
you should suspect that you have a greater variety of cracker 
<BR>
personalities (if you're profiling your attacker). This could mean very 
<BR>
persistent and intelligent kids. Second, collaborative cracking 
<BR>
attacks... this we've seen quite a bit last year already. With such 
<BR>
collaborative efforts, do you think they will all simply use scripted 
<BR>
attacks? With the exchange of ideas and methods, I would think they 
<BR>
could easily go beyond your simple scripted attacks.
<BR>
<P>Also, some of the recent attacks I'm aware of involve sniffers. So even 
<BR>
if you're on an Alpha, if you run something like telnet, or 
<BR>
non-anonymous ftp with a user account over a public network, you're 
<BR>
screwed.
<BR>
<P>About a year ago, I had just gotten a cable modem service, and was 
<BR>
running a windows 95 box on it. I had ftp running so that I could 
<BR>
transfer files from work with an non-anonymous account, with user and 
<BR>
password different from my higher security accounts. I just wanted to 
<BR>
keep warez people from uploading to every anonymous ftp site, but still 
<BR>
be able to ftp myself a few files from work (low security docs).
<BR>
<P>Well one day, someone somehow was able to execute a change in the win95 
<BR>
registry remotely, subsequently gaining anonymous ftp access. They then 
<BR>
uploaded an executable containing a virus. And that was it... clearly 
<BR>
the work of some kid screwing around. Fortunately, I never executed the 
<BR>
virus, and during a standard virus scan, it was found and deleted. I 
<BR>
later checked my logs and via some social engineering with the ISP, 
<BR>
found out it was some college kid living in southern california. I 
<BR>
contacted the kid to tell him I knew it was him, he got a little scared, 
<BR>
and was surprised that anyone could track him down. He apologized, 
<BR>
almost sounding like he pissed in his pants... so I figure it was enough 
<BR>
and since no real damage was done, nor did i have anything important on 
<BR>
my win95 box, I let him go... actually, he and I keep in touch and are 
<BR>
more or less buddies. Anyways, the point is, your typical college kid 
<BR>
found some way to change the win95 registry remotely... that to me is a 
<BR>
pretty sofisticated attack... well, at least it still beats me as to how 
<BR>
he did that. I've never seen this attack in the standard security 
<BR>
bulletins... maybe I missed something, but at least to me, this is 
<BR>
beyond running a few standard scripts.
<BR>
<P>Ok.. this is getting way off topic... anyone wanting to discuss security 
<BR>
with me, just email me directly,... I think I've had enough of this 
<BR>
discussion on the list.
<BR>
<P>D.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Why Alpha?  A couple of my development projects need 64bit support.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Most of the rest is security thru obscurity -- few to none of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;script kiddie hacks work on Alphas (they rely on one or more of x86,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;little-endian, 32bit).  This lets me be a little more sloppy in my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;security maintenance and still keep a working system on the public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Internet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There has been a little debate on the list lately becuse of this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;statement. I'll defend it too :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It is sort of true that using an Alpha over Intel is security through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;obscurity. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However, I'll tell you what .. if I wanted root on most anyone's 
</EM><BR>
machine
<BR>
<EM>&gt;bad enough, I could probably get it.. even people that follow CERT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;religiously and who patch every known hole in the software and OS.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;How? The hardware is probably insecure. I walk into your house, sit at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the console and boot to a floppy. I have root. I mount your partition,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;change /etc/shadow, and reboot. You are hosed. If you have a BIOS 
</EM><BR>
password
<BR>
<EM>&gt;it'll take me a few more minutes to pull the CMOS RAM battery .. but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if I have the console, I basically have root. Most people have little, 
</EM><BR>
if
<BR>
<EM>&gt;any, home security. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now, I don't want to get off on a security tangent here.. but this is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;parallel to Intel/Alpha security issues.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Most attackers who will break into your home don't give a crap about 
</EM><BR>
root.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;They'll take the machine itself, pawn it off and they don't need root. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Most attackers who want root, won't break into your home. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Therefore to keep someone from getting root on your box, you don't need 
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt;live on a military base and keep your machine in a bank vault. Physical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;compromise isn't a likely attack scenario for most people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Similarly, for many servers, scripted attacks are the only ones they 
</EM><BR>
have
<BR>
<EM>&gt;to worry about. For the guys that can get into any box because they 
</EM><BR>
write
<BR>
<EM>&gt;the scripts to begin with, they will have more interesting targets. 
</EM><BR>
They
<BR>
<EM>&gt;aren't in the attack scenario.. script kiddies running around with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;new 0-day DoS attack are the ones that will likely hit your machine. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Using an Alpha stops them. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If you're protecting nuclear launch codes, you're working in a 
</EM><BR>
different
<BR>
<EM>&gt;model .. if you're just trying to run a box to keep a smooth internet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;connection going, and don't necessarily have secrets to hide, 
</EM><BR>
protecting
<BR>
<EM>&gt;from script kiddies is fine, so long as you don't make for yourself 
</EM><BR>
some
<BR>
<EM>&gt;intelligent enemies and change your threat model all around again.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Myself, I have known vunerabilities in software that I use. I accept 
</EM><BR>
these
<BR>
<EM>&gt;vunerabilities because the only two users of the machine are myself and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a trusted friend (who has root via sudo anyhow .. so if he really wants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to get flashy and get a root shell through a 'sploit instead .. who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cares?). So, I don't worry about local attacks .. instead I keep remote
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;access tied down. SSH happens to be the only way in from unknown 
</EM><BR>
networks,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;and telnet w/ OPIE is as good as it gets for trusted networks.. all 
</EM><BR>
other
<BR>
<EM>&gt;daemons are firewalled. And, really, OPIE would be good enough for me 
</EM><BR>
..
<BR>
<EM>&gt;but I like playing with crypto so I set SSH up just to do it. A 
</EM><BR>
different
<BR>
<EM>&gt;threat model than if I had a hundred and twenty users to worry about.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Real security is about balancing use vs. security.. because, if you 
</EM><BR>
pursue
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;security&quot; (paranoia is a better word) fully, you'll bury your box 
</EM><BR>
under
<BR>
<EM>&gt;30 feet of concrete and steel with no network connection and no users 
</EM><BR>
(not
<BR>
<EM>&gt;even yourself). Because as long as there _is_ a way in, there is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;possibility for unauthorized access. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It's all about threats and acceptable models for an application, 
</EM><BR>
folks..
<BR>
<EM>&gt;not some imaginary end of &quot;absolute security&quot; .. it doesn't exist.. for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reasons closely tied to stuff like Godel's Incompleteness Theorem or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Turing's Halting Problem.. its just something you have to live with.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now, I better cover this now, because someone invariably says it .. the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;OTP is an absolutably secure cryptosystem, yes. But an OTP doesn't help
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you when an attacker takes some .. compromising pictures .. of your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;secretary or attorney, or .... and gets her to steal the pad. Its only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;absolutably secure in a given model, namely in a model where 
</EM><BR>
eavesdropping
<BR>
<EM>&gt;on the ciphertext and even some (or all) knowledge of the plaintext is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the only attacks. An OTP gives no message authentication .. if you're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;worried about that sort of thing, you need to use a MAC too.. it 
</EM><BR>
doesn't
<BR>
<EM>&gt;help against bribery or torture. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You have to pick your likely threats.
</EM><BR>
