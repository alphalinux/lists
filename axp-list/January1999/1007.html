<EM>&gt;an extremely reliable system for which there are no decent browsers

<EM>&gt;available (IHMO) and no Frontpage extensions, and seems half of the apps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I want to run aren't ported to alpha yet.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm .. Yeah, I imagine this is a problem for a lot of folks. As I said in
<BR>
a recent message, my favorite browser is Lynx.. so I'm golden on jus
<BR>
about any sort of UNIX platform in the universe. Pays to have simple
<BR>
tastes, I guess. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;To make a long story short, I'd like to know what you folks out there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who are HAPPY with your Alphas do with them.
</EM><BR>
<P>At this point, code. I bought my UDB in order to have an Alpha to port my
<BR>
software to .. on the assumption that after the porting was done, I'd
<BR>
be getting a more muscular machine for actual work. Oddly enough, the
<BR>
porting easier than I thought it would, and the bottom fell out of my
<BR>
budget due to  the death and subsequent dismemberment of one of our
<BR>
servers. So, I have to wait to get my grown-up Alpha :( 
<BR>
<P>As for me, .. I'm a realist. I don't like MS any more than the
<BR>
rest of us, but when I need a box to run canned applications and stuff, I
<BR>
will probably throw together a Windows machine an call it a day. 
<BR>
<P>Now, luckily for me.. I don't need such machines too often. :) Math
<BR>
(DSP, crypto and some visualization) and process control are the things
<BR>
that I do, and Linux is the way to go for that. I run Applixware on my
<BR>
Linux boxes (Intel and Alpha) for general purpose synthesis.. grab the
<BR>
numbers out my programs, throw them into a spreadsheet, write up a bit
<BR>
of explanation and send it up to my boss or my professor.. then I can
<BR>
go play.
<BR>
<P>Occasionally I actually fire up Lynx while doing such work.. 
<BR>
<P>On my notebook, however, I use Windows  .. no math or process control on
<BR>
this puppy .. just applications. Of course, the fact that Linux (XFree,
<BR>
really) doesn't support my video chipset in 16 bpp mode, nor my sound
<BR>
hardware helps push me to Windows easily. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  I'll probably sell mine to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that sector, and buy myself an Intel.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, FWIW, Mozilla will come along and be stable for Alpha .. if you want
<BR>
to wait. But, if your main interests are web browsing and document markup,
<BR>
yeah .. Intel is probably your best bet, preferrably with Linux. 
<BR>
<P>I guess its good to be a geek.. you could set me down at a machine with 
<BR>
just 8 leds for output and 32 or so switches for input to the bus line 
<BR>
and that uses the tapping of a radio operator's code key for the clock and
<BR>
I'd happily code it to do something :)
<BR>
<P>hey .. wow .. thats actually a really cool idea. I guess its time to pick
<BR>
up another 8051. Wait till my grandfather finds me using his code key
<BR>
for THAT. He'll be proud. ;)
