<EM>&gt; I had no idea I would spark such a thread of emails when I posted &quot;Wanna Buy My Alpha&quot; last week, but the conversation has helped me immensely.  As I knew when I bought the Alpha, it's a great machine.  unfortunately, I thought that support for Linux on it was further along than it is.  Based on all your input, I've decided to go back to Intel and sell the Alpha, (Ebay item #59283468 if you're interested) but I will keep watching the list and the sites and when Alpha support is more common, I'll be back!

Hi ..
<BR>
<P>I too will be headed back to the Intel platform. After 6 months of
<BR>
struggling, I don't beleive this platform is for me ( a hobbyist). I
<BR>
certainly learned a lot here about SCSI, Linux in general, and most
<BR>
importantly: the Linux communtiy has an &quot;it can be done&quot; attitude
<BR>
compared to the &quot;if we ask for it maybe we'll get it&quot; in the non-open
<BR>
source communities.
<BR>
<P>If you are interested in a 21046 275MHz Cabriloet board let me know
<BR>
soon. I will be posting it on ebay probably tomorrow or Monday.
<BR>
<P>Thanks again
