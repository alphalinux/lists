<P>
<EM>&gt;&gt;If this is a Digital Personal Workstation 500a,... you'll have to give
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;up using the onboard ethernet if you want two ethernet interfaces. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;problem you describe is well known... and there is hint that it may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;fixed in a firmware update... so try that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;When I realized that I reasponded to a two month old mail, I said, 
</EM><BR>
&quot;oops&quot;,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;but I guess your problem hasn't been solved.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You probably misunderstood my response, as I have successfully 
</EM><BR>
installed a
<BR>
<EM>&gt;second functioning Tulip card in my computer.  My system is the DPWS 
</EM><BR>
500a,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;it has always used AlphaBIOS 5.65 and above, the firmware always 
</EM><BR>
recognized
<BR>
<EM>&gt;both chips.  The firmware update process seemed painless to me.  I had 
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt;little trouble getting Linux to use both properly, but a Linux guy 
</EM><BR>
helped
<BR>
<EM>&gt;me and we found that the de4x5 driver does the trick.
</EM><BR>
<P>So you are saying that if I use the de4x5 driver with the tulip chip, 
<BR>
all should be okay? I will get both tulips or tulip and 3com chip 
<BR>
working? 
<BR>
<P>With the tulip driver, I get both interfaces to come up... ifconfig says 
<BR>
they are fine... in dmesg, the kernel recognized them fine too... but 
<BR>
after a few minutes.. the link light dies.. even though ifconfig thinks 
<BR>
everything is ok. were these the same symptoms? 
<BR>
<P>Thanks for responding.
<BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If you still have trouble, please email me personally if you want.  If 
</EM><BR>
your
<BR>
<EM>&gt;firmware upgrade simply barfs, maybe you should contact your vendor or 
</EM><BR>
DEC
<BR>
<EM>&gt;itself.
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;I have the PWS 500a, and I've tried a million different things to try 
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;work with the onboard ethernet and another tulip card I installed. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;also tried installing a 3com card... but still the same problem. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;eventually gave up and installed both the tulip card and 3com card and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;disabled the onboard ethernet chip. You're probably noticing that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;onboard ethernet starts spitting packets out like mad... and then 
</EM><BR>
dying.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;I've tried all combinations of compiling the drivers as modules and in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;the kernel... no luck. I've also tried several versions of the tulip
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;drivers... but after I noticed the same problem with the 3c59x driver, 
</EM><BR>
I
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;realized it wasn't a driver problem... there is just something funky
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;about that onboard 21143 tulip chip.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Sorry, this isn't good news. But at least you know.... however, there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;are hints in the latest firmware update that might fix this.... so 
</EM><BR>
give
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;that a try. I haven't yet tried it,.. as on my first attempt, it 
</EM><BR>
failed
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;to update the firmware.... if you have better luck, please let us 
</EM><BR>
know.
