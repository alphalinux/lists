<P>
<EM>&gt;emerged.  DEC has always been funny that way, more reserved in their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;marketing efforts.  Why? Because Alpha users typically chose DEC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;technology on the basis of technical merits rather than a marketeer's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;smooth tounge.  AlphaLinux follows suit similarly, attracting users who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are not impressed by dancing Intel engineers in colored spacesuits.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In other words, AlphaLinux does not need the marketing expertise of 
</EM><BR>
Compaq
<BR>
<EM>&gt;to continue as an excellent platform to run Linux on.  What AlphaLinux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;does need, however, is the /technical/ support of Compaq in the arena 
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt;optmized compilers at reasonable price, availability of technical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;documents, pre-release information for Linux developers, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>I guess that is where I disagree with you. I'm a technology lover, so I 
<BR>
got myself a Alpha. But how many of us are there? We're a minority in 
<BR>
the general population. If people like us want money so that we get nice 
<BR>
paychecks and can continue to develop cool technology, we need to appeal 
<BR>
to the mass market. I have no doubt that Alpha is a excellent platform 
<BR>
for Linux, I couldn't agree with you more. But for development to 
<BR>
continue, and to thrive, money is required. And you won't get that money 
<BR>
just by appealing to technology savy people. I agree, we need optimized 
<BR>
compilers, documentations, etc... but for all that to happen, you have 
<BR>
to hire people to do it. And for a business to survive, and justify 
<BR>
hiring those people, they need to justify a profitable business market. 
<BR>
We can all see from the likes of AOL, Microsoft, Intel, that appealing 
<BR>
to the mass market is key to a successful business in technology... even 
<BR>
if the technology isn't that good, appeal to the mass market can still 
<BR>
result in a good business(reference to AOL and Microsoft). That is why I 
<BR>
hope that a truely good technology like Alpha will be made to appeal to 
<BR>
the mass market... and for once, we'll have the best of both worlds, 
<BR>
good technology and popular appeal(hence profitable for businesses to 
<BR>
support). 
<BR>
<P>D.
