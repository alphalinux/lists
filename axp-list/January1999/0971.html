<P>
<EM>&gt; I'm trying to build RPMs for Mesa... however, it's saying that some of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the libs don't exist after it builds.... so the RPM build fails. Did you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; encounter this too? If so, how did you fix it?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I got the same damn thing. There's an error in the spec file, I wonder
<BR>
how the rpms got built to begin with? I didn't put too much time into
<BR>
it, Maybe later tonight i'll take another look at the spec. It's really
<BR>
just a path screwup.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Also, I see a lot of -lm in Mesa during compile, did you attempt to include 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; -lffm ? I'm going to try it.... as I'm sure a graphics library
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can benefit from using libffm.a.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I saw that but at the time with the spec being all screwed up it wasn't
<BR>
worth it to add another lib to Mesa seeing I couldn't make an rpm out of
<BR>
it just yet. I also noticed that the OpenGL screensavers in KDE were
<BR>
slooooow as hell on my machine I mean embarresing, That's why I took
<BR>
them out. I'm definitley looking foward to link Mesa against libffm and
<BR>
the other acceleration libraries.
<BR>
<P>I also learned that from the guy that was doing the blender port the
<BR>
Mesa uses int's almost exclusivly. If it were ot use floats maybe the
<BR>
Alpha would be able to cut them up better and increase the speed. I'll
<BR>
find out more about the performance benifit before I attempt to change
<BR>
Mesa.
