I am new to the whole concept of running Linux on Alpha machines.  I
<BR>
have used linux before and installed it numerous times on Intel/x86
<BR>
based machines, but I am interested in starting my own Alpha based
<BR>
server.  I have got Linux up and running on an 2000 AXP/150 (Jensen)
<BR>
machine at work, but I am looking for a machine for home.  I have never
<BR>
put together an Alpha machine or know too much about the architecture,
<BR>
but I build Intel PCs all the time.  Here is what it comes down to:  I
<BR>
would like to put a machine toghether for me to use at home.  I don't
<BR>
want something with too much horsepower, something like the Jensen,
<BR>
maybe around 233mhz is good.  I was looking at the Multia, but don't
<BR>
know what to look for or where to start...  does anybody know where I
<BR>
can gets some good used or new parts (don't want it too pricey) to put
<BR>
one together.  I don't want to spend more than it would take to build an
<BR>
Intel PC, around $1000 for me.
<BR>
<P>Thanks
