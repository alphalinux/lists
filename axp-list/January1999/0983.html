<EM>&gt; The problem is that the boot file says that Buslogic

I recently ran into the same Flashpoint problem with RedHat's

documentation... got the same &quot;FlashPoint support was omitted in this

I sent an email to Leonard Zubkoff asking about this on 1/11/99 and

how I could be of help.  He has not replied, and I have not pursued

<P><A HREF="http://www.dandelion.com/Linux/BusLogic.html">http://www.dandelion.com/Linux/BusLogic.html</A>
<BR>
<P>is x86 only.  This is the driver in 2.1.132.  I haven't checked if it
<BR>
has been changed in 2.2.0pre-*; that seems unlikely...
<BR>
<P>Enclosed at the bottom is my post to this list of 1/11/99, which I

also sent it to <A HREF="mailto:faq-maintainer@redhat.com?subject=Re:Flashpoint%20on%20Alpha%20(was%20Re:%20Hello,%20it's%20Newbie%20again.)">faq-maintainer@redhat.com</A>, hoping that the Alpha
<BR>
Hardware compatibility list would be revised, but that hasn't
<BR>
happened.
<BR>
<P>So, if you are on a non-x86 machine, it doesn't matter if you
<BR>
configure your kernel with the Flashpoint option
<BR>
(CONFIG_SCSI_OMIT_FLASHPOINT is not set in your .config); the driver
<BR>
code is hardwired to silently omit Flashpoint support for you if
<BR>
__i386__ is not defined...

Subject: Flashpoint not supported for Alpha/Documentation error
Date: Mon, 11 Jan 1999 17:37:09 -0500
From: Craig P Prescott &lt;<A HREF="mailto:prescott@phys.ufl.edu?subject=Re:Flashpoint%20on%20Alpha%20(was%20Re:%20Hello,%20it's%20Newbie%20again.)">prescott@phys.ufl.edu</A>&gt;
<P>Well, at least I got bit by this.  Perhaps this could be an entry on
an &quot;Encountered Problems&quot; page.  Otherwise, at least it will be
documented in the list.
<P>Please correct me if I am wrong, but there seems to be a problem in
RedHat's Alpha hardware compatibility list regarding the Mylex
Flashpoint SCSI adapters.  IMHO, this should get fixed.
<P>The RedHat Alpha hardware compatibility list claims the Mylex/BusLogic
Flashpoint SCSI adapters are supported (Tier 1); see:
<P><A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/support/docs/rhl/alpha/rh52-hardware-alpha-4.html#ss4.2">http://www.redhat.com/support/docs/rhl/alpha/rh52-hardware-alpha-4.html#ss4.2</A>
<P>and I quote 
<P>&quot;The following SCSI adapters are supported: 
<P>Mylex (a.k.a. BusLogic) MultiMaster and (now also) FlashPoint adapters.&quot;
<P>This is, however, not true.  Even if you *think* you are building your
kernel with Flashpoint support enabled (during make config, say &quot;N&quot; to
CONFIG_SCSI_OMIT_FLASHPOINT), you don't get it...  that's because
drivers/scsi/BusLogic.h silently does an end-around on you:
<P>/*
  FlashPoint support is only available for the Intel x86 Architecture with
  CONFIG_PCI set.
*/
<P>#ifndef __i386__
#undef CONFIG_SCSI_OMIT_FLASHPOINT
#define CONFIG_SCSI_OMIT_FLASHPOINT
#endif
<P>Ack!  Hence, this card isn't supported for any non-x86 arch.  BTW, the
stuff in Config.help also makes no mention of this...  Anyway, too
bad, because this card can be found very cheaply (~$50 from onsale).
<P>Anybody ever tried removing the above and giving the driver a go?  I
haven't gotten around to it...
<P>Cheers,
Craig
