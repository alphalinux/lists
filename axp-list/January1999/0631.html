Okay.. maybe here is a perspective that might get Redhat people thinking 
<BR>
since they plan to target the enterprise with Linux.
<BR>
<P>I wasn't aware of the broken DHCPCD... since I don't have enough 
<BR>
machines here to justify using DHCP. But on a corporate network with 
<BR>
hundreds (thousands?) of nodes, IP management is a pain unless you use 
<BR>
something like DHCP. So, RedHat, if any of you read this.... perhaps 
<BR>
it's in your best interest to fix and test more of your distributions? 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;From my experience, IT managers will dismiss a product if it doesn't 
</EM><BR>
work out of the box... they don't want to spend time to fix a product 
<BR>
that they expect to work out of the box....food for thought?
<BR>
<P>But also, as I've stated in a post a long time ago... if RedHat people 
<BR>
are too busy to test the distribution, they should release a 
<BR>
no-guarantee (or implied), &quot;beta&quot; distribution and let others test and 
<BR>
submit results. Perhaps offer volunteer &quot;beta-testers&quot; a free RH box 
<BR>
once it is &quot;officially&quot; released? I know the rawhide site seems to be 
<BR>
doing something like this... but how much feedback does redhat get?
<BR>
<P>Overall, if RedHat, or Linux in general wants to penetrate into the 
<BR>
market of corporate computing, these kind of things need to be fixed.
<BR>

<EM>&gt;With regards to your message at 01:06 PM 01-11-99 PST, Designer 7. 
</EM><BR>
Where
<BR>
<EM>&gt;you stated:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Now, that is something I don't understand... if the ipfwadm works with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;5.0 then why does RH insist on bundling a broken ipfwadm with 5.1 and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;5.2? The only difference is that the release number of the ipfwadm 
</EM><BR>
with 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;5.2 and 5.1 is higher (perhaps a patch?). I just don't understand...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Me neither, but then why did they also include a broken DHCPCD binary 
</EM><BR>
on 5.2?
<BR>
<EM>&gt;All this makes hooking up a machine to a network an &quot;interesting&quot; 
</EM><BR>
proposition.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;All I can say is that it looks like they actually &quot;test&quot; very little, 
</EM><BR>
if
<BR>
<EM>&gt;any of this software on anything _but_ a &quot;standard&quot; ethernet to a hub. 
</EM><BR>
If
<BR>
<EM>&gt;you use a modem, cable-modem, ISDN, or anything else like that it is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;uphill battle with 5.2
</EM><BR>
