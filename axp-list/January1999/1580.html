Quoting Ari Jort (<A HREF="mailto:arijort@thorn.net?subject=Re:%20off-topic%20thought%20on%20problematic%20dates%20(was%20Re:%20January%2019,%202038)">arijort@thorn.net</A>):
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For instance, of the fixed or at least tackles problems,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how many were from systems built in the 60's, 70's, 80's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or even 90's?
</EM><BR>
<P>Before you say &quot;or even 90's&quot;, you should note that in 1997 I had a
<BR>
knock-down, drag-out fight with my manager because he wanted to implement a
<BR>
design that we'd gotten from another department in the same company, even
<BR>
though I kept pointing out that there were only two digits in the date field
<BR>
and everything would break horribly in a mere three years.  Managers are
<BR>
morons, so I don't doubt that stuff is being rolled out TODAY that isn't Y2K
<BR>
compliant.
