<P>
With regards to your message at 10:17 AM 01-31-99 +0000, Shane Sturrock.
<BR>
Where you stated:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Peter, it is great that you are doing all these RPMs but unfortunately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for those of us with older machines (21064/21066 processors) your RPMs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't seem to work since they were compiled with instructions our machines
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't support.  I tried to install your KDE-1.1 RPMs and it dies with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;complaint about illegal instructions.  Can I suggest that if people are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;going to take on the task of compiling stuff and putting it up for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;download that they either stick to compiling for older generation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;processors or put up two versions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt;Linux, a better WinNT than WinNT
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe you or someone else would be willling to volunteer to do this?
<BR>
<P>I think it is only fair to compliment Peter for all the work he has done,
<BR>
and continues to do.
<BR>
I feel that what you said would likely be construed as a criticism, and
<BR>
that is just not fair. Peter did this work, in his own private time, for
<BR>
free, and as a gesture of goodwill and kindness to many fellow users. To
<BR>
knock his method or to say he is not thorough enough is not warranted.
<BR>
As for his compiling for older machines, how is he supposed to test this if
<BR>
he doesn't _have_ an older machine?
<BR>
<P><P>My $02 worth, anyway.
<BR>
