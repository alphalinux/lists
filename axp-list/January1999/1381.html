Hello,
<BR>
<P>I'm trying to compile 2.2.0 release kernel that i just downloaded 
<BR>
tonight. However, the compile is failing for some odd reason.
<BR>
<P>during the final stage of linking the kernel... 
<BR>
the error message is this:
<BR>
<P>drivers/sound/sound.a(sb_ess.o): In function 'ess_init'
<BR>
sb_ess.c(.text+0x114c): undefined reference to 'esstype'
<BR>
make: *** [vmlinux] error 1
<BR>
<P>by the way... there was also another problem which was that sb_ess.c was 
<BR>
missing 
<BR>
<P>#include &lt;linux/delay.h&gt;
<BR>
<P><P>anyways... so I looked in sb_ess.c for the function ess_init. And it's 
<BR>
something like this...
<BR>
<P>&lt;beginning of sb_ess.c&gt;
<BR>
<P>...stuff
<BR>
<P>extern int esstype; /* ... from sb_card.c */
<BR>
<P>... stuff..
<BR>
<P>int ess_init(stuff..)
<BR>
{
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some code using 'esstype' in a if() and switch(esstype)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;statement.
<BR>
}
<BR>
<P>..stuff...
<BR>
<P>&lt;end of sb_ess.c&gt;
<BR>
<P>Next I looked into sb_card.c
<BR>
and sure enough, I see:
<BR>
<P>int esstype = 0;    /* ESS chip type */
<BR>
<P>so, from what I can remember, shouldn't this be fine? Doesn't the 
<BR>
compiler just compile 'esstype' as unresolved reference and then 
<BR>
resolves it during the the object file linking stage? Or am I missing 
<BR>
something here? I'm not a programmer... just play around as a 
<BR>
hobby(meaning self-taught as necessary), so if I'm clueless, please 
<BR>
enlighten!?
<BR>
<P>And as far as I can tell, 'make' is doing the right thing... so what is 
<BR>
up with this?
<BR>
<P>Any wisdom appreciated! Thanks.
<BR>
D.
