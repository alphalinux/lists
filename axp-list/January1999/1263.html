<P>
<EM>&gt;     You are comparing apples and oranges.  Read my last post regarding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; benchmarking.  It really, really (really, folks!) depends on what your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; application is.  For floating-point intensive code, the Alpha will win
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hands down when pitted against a P2/266 - especially on large matrix
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manipulations or bitonic searches. But compared to a P2/450, I can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really say.  Don't have one running Linux to compare it to.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, at the risk of being irrelevant, I'll answer that by throwing out a data 
<BR>
point:
<BR>
<P>I have an SX164 (533MHz) with 128MB of RAM and SCSI, and a buddy of mine has a 
<BR>
P2 450 with 256MB of RAM and Ultra EIDE, both with Red Hat 5.2.  After several 
<BR>
comparisons, including a few benchmarks (such as &quot;whetstone&quot;, rc5des, and Linux 
<BR>
kernel compilations :) we have reached the opinion that my box is somewhat 
<BR>
slower than his on integer/miscellaneous stuff, depending on what you're doing. 
<BR>
&quot;Somewhat&quot; is between 15% and 30%.
<BR>
<P>On floating point, my box is about 25% - 30% faster, fairly reliably.  (Well, 
<BR>
with libffm anyway.  Without libffm, we're about the same.)
<BR>
<P>This is, of course, highly non-scientific and subjectively arbitrary, but it's 
<BR>
Good Enough For Me(TM).  There are times when I wish I'd gone Intel, and times 
<BR>
when I just stand up and cheer over how cool the Alpha is.  I don't keep track 
<BR>
of which outnumbers which. :)
