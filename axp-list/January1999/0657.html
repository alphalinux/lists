<P>
With regards to your message at 11:40 AM 01-12-99 PST, Designer 7. Where
<BR>
you stated:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Okay.. maybe here is a perspective that might get Redhat people thinking 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;since they plan to target the enterprise with Linux.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I wasn't aware of the broken DHCPCD... since I don't have enough 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;machines here to justify using DHCP. But on a corporate network with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hundreds (thousands?) of nodes, IP management is a pain unless you use 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;something like DHCP. So, RedHat, if any of you read this.... perhaps 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it's in your best interest to fix and test more of your distributions? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;From my experience, IT managers will dismiss a product if it doesn't 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;work out of the box... they don't want to spend time to fix a product 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that they expect to work out of the box....food for thought?
</EM><BR>
<P>In principle this is a _very_ good idea. So good that Red Hat even claim
<BR>
they are doing it, with a formal beta-tster program, the bugzilla website,
<BR>
and so on.
<BR>
In practice they actually seem very unreceptive to the feedback they get.
<BR>
For example, in the bug report I made about our experiences with the DHCPCD
<BR>
problem they replied that they would have to get a cable modem to test
<BR>
this... Huh?
<BR>
<P>In another bug report I made where I pointed out that using the &quot;update&quot;
<BR>
option in Red Hat 5.2 there was a crash that happened if you tried to
<BR>
select packages.
<BR>
They repsonded (correctly) that there was a new boot disk image already
<BR>
posted to fix this. Proble is, they only posted this update file on the
<BR>
update.redhat.com ftp site.
<BR>
As this site is _EXTREMELY_ busy, and as almost all of the mirrors of
<BR>
Redhat do not carry this site, in practice  it was very difficult to obtain
<BR>
the update. To further compound the problem they also have an &quot;updates&quot;
<BR>
directory in the regular Red Hat ftp site and its mirrors, which doen _not_
<BR>
contain the same things as the update ftp site..
<BR>
<P>What they seem to need, in practice, is not more ability to produce or
<BR>
support their products ( they already have the tools for this part), but
<BR>
better management to make sure that the results get to the users. They also
<BR>
could probably use an attitude adjustment, strictly IMHO, because I find
<BR>
that while they &quot;claim&quot; to support their products, in my and many others
<BR>
experience this &quot;support&quot; is very difficult to find or get a straight
<BR>
answer from, unless they are embarrassed into doing it.
<BR>
&nbsp;Hence my somewhat critical and antagonistic approach to these matters. I
<BR>
am not _really_ trying to be a jerk. It is simply that we have tried all
<BR>
the &quot;official&quot; routes to support, and have seen very little real results
<BR>
from them, in reality.
<BR>
&nbsp;Again, IMHO, if Red Hat was as good at supporting their software as they
<BR>
are at spin-doctoring and PR this would be a bloody amazing Linux
<BR>
distribution.   ;^]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But also, as I've stated in a post a long time ago... if RedHat people 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are too busy to test the distribution, they should release a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;no-guarantee (or implied), &quot;beta&quot; distribution and let others test and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;submit results. Perhaps offer volunteer &quot;beta-testers&quot; a free RH box 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;once it is &quot;officially&quot; released? I know the rawhide site seems to be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;doing something like this... but how much feedback does redhat get?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Overall, if RedHat, or Linux in general wants to penetrate into the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;market of corporate computing, these kind of things need to be fixed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe. This attitude and practice have served well for Microsoft...
<BR>
Let's not confuse substance with marketing  ;^}
