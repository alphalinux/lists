Hello,
<BR>
<P>Thanks for documenting the GNOME problem and solution.  One little
<BR>
correction: my email address is not correction: my email address is not powell@nist.gov.  You probably got that
<BR>
from the Sender: field, which is a meaningless field and should be
<BR>
ignored.  (It has the local username @ the SMTP host, which in this case is
<BR>
bogus and goes to a different Powell.  Netscape 4.5 is the first email
<BR>
program I have seen that handles this properly, by allowing the setting of
<BR>
a SMTP password.  Just discovered that this morning, so you'll never see a
<BR>
bogus address in the Sender: field from me again. :-)
<BR>
<P>The From: field is the valid one.
<BR>
<P>Thanks again,
<BR>
<P>-Adam.
<BR>
<P><PRE>
