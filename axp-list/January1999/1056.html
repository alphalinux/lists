Hi Guys,
<BR>
I just got my first cd burner which is a PlexWriter 4/12 a week ago and it
<BR>
was working ok up until yesterday which was when I decided to upgrade to
<BR>
redhat 5.2.  Well I found that I didn't like 5.2 because well it screwed
<BR>
up my whole system so I reinstalled 5.1 from scratch. Once it was done i
<BR>
rebooted with my 2.2-6 kernel and began to install xcdroast ( latest
<BR>
version). Now I've made succesfull burns in the past up until now with
<BR>
the same program. I began to burn a cd for a friend VJ++ which is 68 megs
<BR>
in size. I read the image/store the image and begin to go to the burn with
<BR>
no test. It starts and then says &quot;There were some errors during blah,
<BR>
check process output&quot; .So I save the process output and check it. Note,
<BR>
I allready have the CDR_FIFOSIZE=4000 as an env variable in mt
<BR>
/etc/profile. I decided to try again with a master I was making of
<BR>
RH-5.2 intel and tried again and failing with the same errors.Here's what
<BR>
process output #1 looks like. There's more.

<P>Now my plextor is supposed to have a 2 meg buffer but cdrecord doesn't

notice. When I tried a second time I got &quot; Sorry no cd recorder or
<BR>
unsupported cd recoder found&quot;. Here's the second process output.

<BR>
<P>That's it. What is going on? The kernel says it's cd-r and /proc/devices
<BR>
also says it's there along with the loopback device. I read the cd-burning
<BR>
howto and found that everything checks out. I'm out of ideas and I'm not
<BR>
too good at this cd burning business either. Another note, When the first
<BR>
cd burn failed with J++ I couldn't eject the caddy from the drive and had
<BR>
to use a paperclip to override  it. I haven't had a succesful burn or test
<BR>
since. Thanks.
