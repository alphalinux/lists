<P>in order to streamline the alpha floating point hardware, the designers
<BR>
opted not to include full support for IEEE 754 (this would include 
<BR>
things like denormals).  the logic behind this decision is that
<BR>
it takes a lot of extra hardware (meaning extra complexity and slower
<BR>
operation) and in the common case, you don't need such things anyway.
<BR>
therefore, fp code can be compiled either to ignore the condition or to
<BR>
raise an exception.  in the latter case, the operating system can then
<BR>
complete the fp calculation in software.  this is essentially what that
<BR>
kernel option does.  without it, all the os can do is send a floating
<BR>
exception to the process, killing it.
<BR>
<P>note that fp completion in software is extremely slow.  if you have an
<BR>
executable that needs it, it's a lifesaver.  but the best solution is to
<BR>
change the code so that it doesnt produce such exceptions in the first
<BR>
place.
<BR>
<P>it's been awhile since i looked at all this in detail, so if i've gotten
<BR>
any of it wrong, please don't hesitate to correct me :)
