<P>Have you ever run a database server?  We were I/O bound even with a fiber
<BR>
channel external RAID box.  The box had six independent SCSI controllers,
<BR>
it's own CPU and a few megs cache onboard.  It connected back to the computer
<BR>
with two fiber channels at 100MB/sec each.  Still, we waited on the disks. We
<BR>
could manage only about 1000 transactions per minute.  Story #2: On a Sun Ultra
<BR>
SPARC with two CPUs, 512MB RAM and UWSCSI disks.  I had to rebuild the index
<BR>
files on a 10,000,000 row database.  It took about nine hours of disk thrashing.
<BR>
Same job on a Pentium with IDE drive took over two days.
<BR>
<P>So to answer the question.  Anyone running a database server can use all the
<BR>
IO bandwidth they can get, and then some.
<BR>
<P>You may notice that some of the bigger servers now have multiple PCI busses.
<BR>
The idea is you put only one UWSCSI controller on each PCI buss so as not
<BR>
to overload it.  So there IS a demand for high IO bandwidth but I don't see
<BR>
the need for it on most desktop workstations.
