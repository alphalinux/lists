I've been successfully booting my UDB 166 since I got it with ARC and
<BR>
MILO but one thing is bothering me.  I am using an old SUN monitor which
<BR>
is capable of resolutions of 1024x768 and 1152x900, I have got SRM to
<BR>
start in a mode which the monitor is happy with but when ARC starts it
<BR>
switches to 640x480 and the monitor doesn't appreciate this.  I have
<BR>
Linux booting into runlevel 5 at 1152x900 and all is well again.  What I
<BR>
would like to do is get the machine to use the 1024x768 mode which SRM
<BR>
is providing with and boot Linux so that I can read the boot messages
<BR>
and have a useful console.
<BR>
<P>It has to be possible, I imagine there are many people using the built
<BR>
in TGA with old workstation monitors which simply don't go down to
<BR>
640x480 so some sort of solution would be very nice.  If I change to
<BR>
booting from SRM will Linux boot in the mode which SRM starts or will it
<BR>
force a change to 640x480 and if so can I get it to boot at 1024x768?
<BR>
<P>Any help most appreciated.
<BR>
