<P><EM>&gt;         The current kernel (generic) framebuffer code won't work on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alphas.  It has some memory access ... methods ... that aren't very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; portable.  (note that the TGA framebuffer works because it bypasses all of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these generic functions)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         There is currently a matroxfb in development which provides
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; partial acceleration for the console framebuffer.  It can be found in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cvs right now, and will probably be a part of 2.1.129.  It doesn't work on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alphas at the moment, but I'm working with the author to remedy that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; situation; Petr has been very helpful and cooperative so far.
</EM><BR>
<P>Cool!  Any progress in the last two months?  I tried building 2.2.0-final with
<BR>
matroxfb and booting, but no dice, even with video=vc.  Same problem as others
<BR>
on this list: I get the first line of kernel output then it dies, regardless of
<BR>
the video variable I give it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;         In the distant past, GGI patched the kernel in order to work.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; With the inclusion of the framebuffer stuff, patches are no longer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; necessary.  It builds kgicon, a module which connects to the fbcon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interface to provide its functionality but also provides the functionality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of kgi -- the ggi Kernel Graphics Interface.  Unlike the kernel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; framebuffer setup, KGI has the ability to accelerate all parts of 2D video
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; display (i.e., when complete it could give X a run for its money).  3D
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support is also in the works.  There is currently an XGGI which uses the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ggi access routines to provide accelerated video for all ggi-supported
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cards.  Matrox support is pretty good.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         However, ggi has io memory (mmio) access problems similar to that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the kernel framebuffer console drivers.  I am currently working with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the GGI folks to remedy this situation as well.  However, this is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slightly larger undertaking than fixing matroxfb and is moving along more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slowly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         Most GGI programs (including XGGI) use libggi for graphics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; routines.  Libggi has support for various targets.  One is direct console
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drawing via. kgi, another is the normal kernel framebuffer (fbcon), and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the third is an X window.  The client program doesn't know or care which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of these it's talking to.  An svgalib wrapper for GGI exists, and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe it to work on Alphas (though I haven't tried).  Therefore, you can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; run svgalib programs in an X window.  If I ever get kgi working, you could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also run those from the console.  If you have a TGA card, libggi has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reported to work with TGAfb.
</EM><BR>
<P>Cool (though I don't have a TGA card).  Where is this documented?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;         For the record, I have a Matrox Millenium II with 4MB of vram, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; normally use the standard linux text console and/or XF86_SVGA.  If I ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get GGI working right, that may change.  I have an sx164, 533MHz.
</EM><BR>
<P>Me too, except LX.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;         If you're willing to test / code / anything, lemme know.  To the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; best of my knowledge, I'm the only one working on either of these for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alphas, and I'm in a rut with the code (for both systems) right now.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could use all the help I can get.
</EM><BR>
<P>Definitely willing to test, and spend some time coding, but can't claim great
<BR>
video hacking skills.
