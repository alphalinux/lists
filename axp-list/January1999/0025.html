<EM>&gt;Hello all and Happy New Year,
</EM><BR>
<P>And to you too!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'm new to SCSI.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But I've read up on it a great deal.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's good...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;My adapter manual says it's at id7
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by default.  And that the ids are to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;regulate who gets buss access first.
</EM><BR>
<P>Uh, OK - I was under the impression that the IDs are to &quot;distinguish&quot;
<BR>
devices from each other, give them a unique ID for commands, etc...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So that makes me think that putting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;my main disk drive at id6 would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a good idea.  But then I got to thinking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;what about my CD drive?  If it is lower
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;down the chain and I'm loading programs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from the CD to the main drive wouldn't that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;slow down the transfer?
</EM><BR>
<P>No. The SCSI adapter will not give any device improved speed/performance
<BR>
based solely on it's ID number - the speed of access will be determined by
<BR>
the capabilities of the SCSI adapter and the SCSI device it is accessing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What is a good configuration for drives on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a scsi chain?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I would suggest something along the following lines, but it really
<BR>
is whatever you want it to be:
<BR>
<P>SCSI ID	Device type
<BR>
-------	-----------------------
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0		Hard drive (Boot device)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1		Hard drive (2nd drive)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2		Hard drive (3rd drive)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3		Hard drive (4th drive)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4		CD-ROM drive
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5		Removeable SCSI drive (tape, ZIP, Jaz, etc.)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6		Removeable SCSI drive (tape, ZIP, Jaz, etc.)
<BR>
<P>Note: When adding hard drives, use SCSI ID#0 first, then 2, 3, then
<BR>
4 - this is because Linux will refer to the first device it finds as
<BR>
sda, the second as sdb, etc. and if you start with a drive at ID 4,
<BR>
when you add a drive with a lower SCSI ID, say 2, IT will become sda
<BR>
and the drive that you were booting from will become sdb - you will
<BR>
then have to re-configure the OS to boot and mount partitions from the
<BR>
sdb drive instead of the sda drive.
<BR>
<P>Also note: I have placed the removeable drives at ID 5 and 6 because I
<BR>
suspect/remember that the Iomega devices have limited ID numbe r selections.
<BR>
<P>Good luck, 
<BR>
<P>Ken
