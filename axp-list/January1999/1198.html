<P>
I am another one of those &quot;bought my AlphaStation dirt-cheap at an web 
<BR>
auction joint&quot; kind of person. I bought my Alpha initially to run Linux to
<BR>
practice for the new Macintosh OS, which is also UNIX flavored. I had my
<BR>
AlphaStation on hold until I finished a few important exams. However, once I
<BR>
was through with the exams I bought RAM, keyboard, mouse, hard-disk, and
<BR>
CD-ROM. After bugging this list briefly I updated my firmware and here I am
<BR>
with a live Alpha running RH 5.2.
<BR>
I ran across KDE and installed it and now I have a fairly consistent desktop
<BR>
environment. With the help of a person from this list I got an MP3 player
<BR>
and Netscape. And, with the help of a developer I got a visual interface for
<BR>
my MP3 player. I compiled WebMaker and a few CGIs, and with Apache I have
<BR>
now all my webpages being served (and edited) from my Alpha.
<BR>
Dang it! I even compiled a kernel to have my sound board working. I ordered
<BR>
ApplixWare to see whether I can start doing some writing with my Alpha.
<BR>
<P>Considering that this list's subscribers and contributors know programming
<BR>
all orders of magnitude above what I know, my little feats are indeed pretty
<BR>
pathetic. However, these recent going back to Intel statements prompted me
<BR>
to write this. It is true that my faster Macintosh is far faster than my
<BR>
AlphaStation for graphic tasks and overall daily use, but Apache and all the
<BR>
other network daemons kick arse. Even GIMP, being slower than Photoshop at
<BR>
comparable tasks, has some advantages over Photoshop and complements it
<BR>
well.
<BR>
<P>In summary, I don't regret have bought the Alpha. Actually, I am curious to
<BR>
see how one of those fast Alphas would perform... ;^)
