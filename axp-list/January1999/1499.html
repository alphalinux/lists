<EM>&gt;&gt; Just thought I'd let everyone know that someone at Alpha-Processor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &quot;unofficially&quot; recommended to no longer use the UX board, because it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; will not be supported with new firmware, consoles or anything else in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; the future.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; On a good note, the DP264 (dual 21264) will be released Monday, the LX
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; is going back into reproduction, the RX board is likely scheduled for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; production by the end of the quarter, and Compaq has a new 21264 based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; machine debuting Monday...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I've only just saved all my hard earned pennies and got myself a UX4
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;based workstation (I assume the UX4 is a 'ruffian', I'm very new to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all the terminology). Currently it only has NT4, but I intend (when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I've worked out what the heck MILO/ARCBIOS/other-stuff is) to install
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;RedHat as my primary operating system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Am I scuppered? 
</EM><BR>
<P>No, you are not. There is &quot;unsupported&quot; as in &quot;we are happy and not
<BR>
changing it&quot; and there is &quot;unsupported&quot; as in &quot;bugger off&quot;.
<BR>
<P>In this case they will not be making any more UX boards ( there are
<BR>
thousands in the warehouses) and no further updates are needed.
<BR>
<P>For that matter the LX falls in the same category. The only reason they are
<BR>
making a few thousand more is that they are popular for clusters, and for
<BR>
running UNIX. As there is SRM firmware available for the UX ( UX is not a
<BR>
DEC/Copaq part but a Deskstation/Samsung/API part) the only choice is the
<BR>
LX. SRM is needed to run UNIX, or to support remote booting over a network
<BR>
via bootp. Still, they are not making _that_ big a quantity of LX, so it is
<BR>
not much different..
<BR>
In either case the chips used to make these boards, both UX and LX are
<BR>
pretty well out of production, and there will be no further large runs of
<BR>
them.
<BR>
<P>All the new development time energy and $$ are going into the DP264 and the
<BR>
SP264. Some effort in the RX, as it is supposed to be a &quot;low cost&quot; Alpha.
<BR>
We shall see...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I thought the UX was the latest greatest 164 system - in which case
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;how come it's dead already?
</EM><BR>
<P>Dead is a strong term.
<BR>
As for latest and greatest, it has been around for a year now. In computer
<BR>
motherboard terms that is getting &quot;pretty old&quot;.  ;^}
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'm no alpha/linux wiz, is there a simple RH CD set I can literally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;install with one command (I'm not lazy, just dumb) and which will then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;work without me having to mother it? I can get access to the RH5.2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all-processor CD set, but have been warned that &quot;it comes with almost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;no instructions&quot;, and it's a 2.0.36(?) kernel which I now read is old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hat. Or shall I just use NT for the rest of its life (no, you can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wish that on anyone). 
</EM><BR>
<P>You wish!
<BR>
Red Hat requires updates. Lots of them. Also some help. That is the main
<BR>
reason this list exists.
