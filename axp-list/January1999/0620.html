<P>I wouldn't go so far as to say it's _wrong_.  Maybe non-standard, but

certainly okay, if you know what you are doing.

<P>What I do is have bash for root and tcsh for my normal user.  I never log

&quot;su -m&quot; and then keep my tcsh shell.  I'd recommend that over making the

root shell tcsh, but it's certainly legal.

<P>It's possible it is trying to dlopen() something in /usr/lib, and in that
<BR>
case, yes, it would be wrong to use it.  But I'm not sure that it is.
<BR>
<P>Hmmm... I just checked my RedHat-5x box, and although tcsh is still only
<BR>
linked to things in /lib, it *is* linked to more libs than bash is.
<BR>
Perhaps it has become increasingly unwise to use tcsh for root shells as
<BR>
time progresses.  In that case, I am convinced: only use bash for root
<BR>
unless you really know what you are getting into.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; root should only be linked against stuff that is always there at any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point in the boot process. On my 5.2 system, bash is only linked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against stuff in /lib, ditto for tcsh -- it uses termcap, which is in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; /lib.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is correct.  tcsh should be as viable as bash at boot time.  I don't
<BR>
know why his isn't, but it wouldn't matter for single user; in single user
<BR>
mode, init will dump you to /bin/sh regardless of what your shell is.
