<EM>&gt; &gt;         There is currently a matroxfb in development which provides 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; partial acceleration for the console framebuffer.  It can be found in the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cvs right now, and will probably be a part of 2.1.129.  It doesn't work on 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Alphas at the moment, but I'm working with the author to remedy that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; situation; Petr has been very helpful and cooperative so far. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Cool!  Any progress in the last two months?  I tried building 2.2.0-final with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matroxfb and booting, but no dice, even with video=vc.  Same problem as others 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on this list: I get the first line of kernel output then it dies, regardless of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the video variable I give it. 
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Which processor does this work under? I tried building on my avanti only
<BR>
to discover that there was no matrox option in the framebuffer section,
<BR>
only a tga. This is the one great thing in my opinion that sucks really
<BR>
hard under alphas right now. :(
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If I knew anything about coding framebuffer stuff, I'd be more than
<BR>
willing to help.

<EM>&gt; &gt;         In the distant past, GGI patched the kernel in order to work. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; With the inclusion of the framebuffer stuff, patches are no longer 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; necessary.  It builds kgicon, a module which connects to the fbcon 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; interface to provide its functionality but also provides the functionality 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of kgi -- the ggi Kernel Graphics Interface.  Unlike the kernel 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; framebuffer setup, KGI has the ability to accelerate all parts of 2D video 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; display (i.e., when complete it could give X a run for its money).  3D 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; support is also in the works.  There is currently an XGGI which uses the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ggi access routines to provide accelerated video for all ggi-supported 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cards.  Matrox support is pretty good. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;         However, ggi has io memory (mmio) access problems similar to that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of the kernel framebuffer console drivers.  I am currently working with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the GGI folks to remedy this situation as well.  However, this is a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; slightly larger undertaking than fixing matroxfb and is moving along more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; slowly. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;         Most GGI programs (including XGGI) use libggi for graphics 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; routines.  Libggi has support for various targets.  One is direct console 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; drawing via. kgi, another is the normal kernel framebuffer (fbcon), and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the third is an X window.  The client program doesn't know or care which 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of these it's talking to.  An svgalib wrapper for GGI exists, and I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; believe it to work on Alphas (though I haven't tried).  Therefore, you can 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; run svgalib programs in an X window.  If I ever get kgi working, you could 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; also run those from the console.  If you have a TGA card, libggi has been 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reported to work with TGAfb. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Cool (though I don't have a TGA card).  Where is this documented? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;         For the record, I have a Matrox Millenium II with 4MB of vram, I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; normally use the standard linux text console and/or XF86_SVGA.  If I ever 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; get GGI working right, that may change.  I have an sx164, 533MHz. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Me too, except LX. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;         If you're willing to test / code / anything, lemme know.  To the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; best of my knowledge, I'm the only one working on either of these for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Alphas, and I'm in a rut with the code (for both systems) right now.  I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; could use all the help I can get. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Definitely willing to test, and spend some time coding, but can't claim great 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; video hacking skills.
