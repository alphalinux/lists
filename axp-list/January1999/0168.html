Hi Angus --
<BR>
My AS200 is a 4/233, but architecturally should be the same box.  Most
<BR>
of the ones that were sold by onsale had number9 S3 video cards.
<BR>
I've just started playing with a couple of Multias, which have embedded
<BR>
TGA video H/W.  The Redhat CD has a TGA-specific Xserver for it.
<BR>
Hopefully it'll get beyond 640X480 soon (if it hasn't already).
<BR>
<P>One of the first things I had to do after I built the box was to
<BR>
upgrade egcs (in my case to 1.1b).  I couldn't build a kernel until
<BR>
I did that  (got it from www.cygnus.com).
<BR>
<P>The other thing you may be running up against is a milo version
<BR>
problem.  I'd been booting my AS200 from SRM, so I hadn't paid much
<BR>
attention to it.  Once I started playing with the Multia, I got
<BR>
nailed by a couple of faq's that said to dd (or rawwrite) the milo
<BR>
stuff to a floppy.  Wrong!  I learned.  As Milo is built against
<BR>
part of the kernel sources, you might want to get the latest
<BR>
from gatekeeper.dec.com.
<BR>
<P>My apologies if I'm rambling on -- I'm just trying to cover the bases.
<BR>
If I need to augment or detail anything, let me know.  If I could
<BR>
get it working, I have no doubt anyone can.
<BR>
<P>a metric boatload is approximately equal to 1.06 English boatloads :-)
<BR>
<P>enjoy,
<BR>
-ls-      
<BR>

<EM>&gt; is an AS200 == alphastation200 4/166?

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mine has a TGA 8 plane card in it like the 4 others that I saw.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I thought I made it obvious that I needed to get a TGA console working (at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is what I think I need to do)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; (&gt; (amackay@skeena)~$ gcc -v

<EM>&gt; Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/alpha-redhat-linux/egcs-2.90.29/specs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gcc version egcs-2.90.29 980515 (egcs-1.0.3 release)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the kernels boots fine but once milo jumps to the kernel the console
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is left alone.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cheers, Angus.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ps. how many cubic furlongs in a metric boatload?

<EM>&gt; It would seem that Larry Snyder (<A HREF="mailto:larrys@lexis-nexis.com?subject=Re:%20console%20for%20an%20alphastation200?">larrys@lexis-nexis.com</A>) said:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Hmmmm...here we go again :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; What's your compiler version?  How about a copy of your .config?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; What's your video hardware?  Most of the recently surplused AS200's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; had an S3 card if one was included.  To paraphrase a very recent post:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; There's a metric boatload of people ready to help.  Please provide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; enough info and you'll be outa the woods in no time!  Unless you have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; some really weird hardware, you don't need to modify the sources
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; at all.  Especially with 2.2.0-pre-2.
