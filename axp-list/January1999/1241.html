<EM>&gt;    My needs include web browsing (Netscape or the equivilent), The GIMP, 3D
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tools (such as Blender and OpenGL acceleration), and running MUD server(s).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; None of this stuff is necessarily bound to any specific platform; hopefully
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the Xi, Metro-X, and SuSE Permedia-accelerated X servers on the way,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3D acceleartion will finally be a reality for the Alpha.  
</EM><BR>
<P>MetroX has Alpha/Linux native X servers for quite some time now, and
<BR>
IMHO,
<BR>
they kick ass in the speed department... (I'm running a Fire GL 1000
<BR>
Pro).
<BR>
They also sell a native Alpha OpenGL kit, but that one is pretty 
<BR>
expensive.
<BR>
Since a short while, there is an Alpha native Blender available :)
<BR>
Gimp, Netscape and MUD all run perfectly fine on Alpha for quite some
<BR>
time.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There are also some small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; niceties missing - for example, AGP video, which makes a big difference in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; screen update time when panning around a nearly full-screen image in the Gimp
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in my prefered screen mode, 1280x1024x[16|24].
</EM><BR>
<P>AGP doesn't make a big difference and you can bet that even my humble
<BR>
21164a 366MHz Alpha kicks my 21164a 366MHz Alpha kicks my PII@450MHz's butt seriously when it comes
<BR>
to heavy Gimping and other gfx stuff :)
<BR>
<P>AGP is only good (opinions vary) for reading cached textures and
<BR>
stuff directly from main memory (which is /way/ slower than accessing
<BR>
the videocard's /native/ memory) and this is only used in games... 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    So - is it worth it?  Will I see enough of a speedup from a (say) PII-266
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to a 21164-533?  What about from a PII-450 to a 21164-533?  Better yet, what's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to make the difference in speed - would it be better to go up in mhz
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (say, to 600 or more) or to get a motherboard with more cache?  I'm already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; planning on UW-SCSI and at least 256 megs of RAM, of course.
</EM><BR>
<P>Depends on what you want to do, for having a good time, lot's of
<BR>
tweaking and the highest coolness factor on earth &gt; get Alpha.
<BR>
To be square, dull and &quot;everything just works&quot; &gt; get x86 :)
