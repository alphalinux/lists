<EM>&gt;the compiler also doesn't have buffer limitations, so it can look at much

<P>YES, I know about that &quot;philosophy&quot; that it's probably the best to put most
<BR>
&quot;brains&quot; into the compiler and not into the CPU, because only the first has the
<BR>
full code available at once and knows what's going on (hopefully), while the CPU
<BR>
has to reconstruct it from the instructions it gets.
<BR>
<P>HOWEVER, why does this seem to be so difficult especially on the Alpha, or 
<BR>
isn't it ??
<BR>
<P>For example, does anybody know how gcc for Ultrasparc (latest version, can't
<BR>
tell the exact code in the moment) compared to the original manufacturers
<BR>
compiler rates ?? This is interesting, because only recently the 2nd real
<BR>
64-bit Linux was starting to materialize, Ultralinux 64 for Ultrasparc. From
<BR>
what I read, the Ultrasparc CPU, highest version, is a heavily out-of-order and
<BR>
register-renaming and ... CPU. Anybody got some details on benchmarks for 
<BR>
both compilers ??
<BR>
<P>(Actually I already contacted some guys on the mailing list there about what
<BR>
they do for the math library problem, however, they are not (yet) ready for
<BR>
that problem, but probably in future there could come some &quot;bilateral&quot; benefits
<BR>
from looking at UltraLinux 64, too)
<BR>
<P>BTW, anybody also knows if a 21264 programmers guide might be available
<BR>
somewhere on the web, or does DEC/Compaq also want to keep the details
<BR>
confidential like the infamous Appendix H (if i recall correctly) for the Intel
<BR>
Pentium ??
