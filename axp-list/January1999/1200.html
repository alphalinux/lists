<P>I think it is important to state that there always will be people who want
<BR>
to have some work done with minimum effort possible. If they have
<BR>
difficulties with Alpha they switch to Intel expecting less pain (I've no
<BR>
idea where they're going if they'll have problems with Intel too). I respect
<BR>
them if they are proffesionals in their own job. They would have been
<BR>
using abacus if there would be no computers around - so what ? It's
<BR>
impossible to learn all civilization knowledge :-)
<BR>
<P>Until there is no anti-development opinion is stated from their site
<BR>
I can understand their position completely.
