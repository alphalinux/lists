</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; With regards to your message at 03:25 PM 01-18-99 +1100, Daniel Potts.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Where you stated:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I am wondering why DS/Ruffian systems have there own loader (ldmilo.exe).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Why doesn't linload.exe work? I am trying to get the evalutation board
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;debug monitor to run on this board - i know it does via linload.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is the result, as I see it, of 2 things:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1) Some people at Desktation wrote ldmilo when they designed this board.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The linload program is a result of work by people at Digital.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2) The reason they wrote their own is that the files and tools used for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; linload were not publically available outside of DEC at that time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since then the needed information and files were released (thanks to Jim
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Paradis' efforts) and some work has gone into making them more &quot;parallel&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in function ( thanks to Jim and Jay++).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; At least that is how I understand it..
</EM><BR>
<P>Pretty close, but... ;-}
<BR>
<P>1. I'm fairly certain that ldmilo was not written by Deskstation until much
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after the board was designed (when having a LINUX loader was deemed to be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;advantageous&quot; :-).
<BR>
<P>2. the reason that the linload sources were not available at the time that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deskstation went to write a LINUX loader, was that the sources used by DEC
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were encumbered; they utilized parts of the API of the NT SDK, which were
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;controlled by MS, and *not* freely available/distributable.
<BR>
<P>But the primary reason that (the original) linload won't work on a UX is
<BR>
staring you in the face; does ARCSBIOS really resemble AlphaBIOS so much
<BR>
that you assume that the underlying support for &quot;console applications&quot; would
<BR>
be identical? Deskstation rolled their own, including BIOS emulation code.
<BR>
Good for them (they control it all), but bad for compatibility.
<BR>
<P>The latest ldmilo was built (by DEC) with sources/development kit made
<BR>
available by Deskstation (thanks!); it has close to the same functionality
<BR>
as linload, with, AFAIK, the only constraint being that the MILO file must
<BR>
always be named &quot;milo&quot;. Have you tried loading the Debug Monitor using this
<BR>
latest ldmilo found on gatekeeper.dec.com:/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/Kernels/?
<BR>
<P>In addition, rumors have surfaced recently of a port of linload to ARCSBIOS;
<BR>
perhaps when this becomes available it will prove to be able to run the
<BR>
Debug Monitor.
