<P><EM>&gt;One last idea. There is an airflow sensor on the CPU fan. Is the sensor

<EM>&gt;plugged in to jumper14 (I believe). This connector is between CPU and

<EM>&gt;the outboard cache module on my board. I believe this has to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;installed to run.

<P>Jeff...
<BR>
<P>Thanks for the tips, keep them coming.
<BR>
<P>I checked jumper 14, and the fan is running.
<BR>
<P>On the subject of power.
<BR>
You know the four power supply plugs?  Two are
<BR>
pretty standard PC looking plugs.  And two are
<BR>
specific for the Alpha.  I plugged the two Alpha
<BR>
plugs in according to the PDF Manual for my board,
<BR>
PCI 64 (Cabriolet) and all I got was a flashing power
<BR>
light.  I plug them in exactly opposite and the power
<BR>
comes on and the drives spin up.
<BR>
<P>What should I believe,  the manual or the power 
<BR>
coming on?
<BR>
<P>What I mean is, if I use the manual plug-in plan,
<BR>
is it correct as far as the power but some other
<BR>
problem causing the light to flash?
<BR>
<P>If I use the opposite and the power comes on is that
<BR>
proof enough that it is correct?
<BR>
<P>I just got back from exchanging some of the memory
<BR>
sticks, so that they all match the same vendor.
<BR>
And they are installed in back 0.  So I'm putting memory
<BR>
on my &quot;done and correct&quot; list.
<BR>
<P>A previous message suggested checking jumpers according
<BR>
to the manual.  Can you give me an idea where to look for
<BR>
J16-2 and J16-3.  I found the note about this jumper in
<BR>
the PDF manual but it doesn't give any hints were it is on the
<BR>
board.
<BR>
<P>TIA
