<P>
<EM>&gt; Do an ls -l of the directory and see if the script is executable. Do a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; man mount and look into how filesystems are mounted such that execute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; permissions are denied. This may be your problem.
</EM><BR>
<P>I checked and it is execuatble.

-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     bin         14329 Dec 18 11:35 install-applix
<BR>
<P>I check the man page like you said and added exec to the line in fstab
<BR>
and it started to work.
<BR>
<P>Problem #2.
<BR>
<P>As the progress meter got to 90% the install process began to hang. I
<BR>
had to kill the window. I then did a top and found that rpm was eating
<BR>
up all my cpu, I had to kill it with sig 9. I'm going to check the
<BR>
errata page now. Any suggestions?  Thanks.
