Hi all,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been salivating over getting an alpha workstation for some years
<BR>
now.  My work is frequently heavily math intensive, especially with
<BR>
floating point.  Now I'm very seriously considering making the switch, and
<BR>
have been investigating prices and options from various Linux-friendly
<BR>
vendors.  Looking at the prices, I'm starting to wonder if it is really
<BR>
&quot;worth it&quot;.  I could build a 400 mhz K6-based system w/ SCSI and lots of
<BR>
RAM for probably $1000.  The basic Alpha system I'm looking at (533 mhz
<BR>
21164) is probably going to cost me well over double that.  However, I've
<BR>
become increasingly disillusioned with the shody design of x86 (I cut my
<BR>
programming teath on the 68000 and the Sparc, which at least had reasonbly
<BR>
clean designs).  In particular we've had prototype Katmais (that's
<BR>
the Intel Pentium III) in the office for about 6 months now, and they
<BR>
are a joke.  It's time for x86 to leave my desktop.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been following the threads about people &quot;reventing&quot; back to
<BR>
x86, and it sounds like there's argument either way.  What I was hoping
<BR>
for it to get those same people to give some specifics as to why
<BR>
one or the other is better.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My needs include web browsing (Netscape or the equivilent), The GIMP, 3D
<BR>
tools (such as Blender and OpenGL acceleration), and running MUD server(s).
<BR>
None of this stuff is necessarily bound to any specific platform; hopefully
<BR>
with the Xi, Metro-X, and SuSE Permedia-accelerated X servers on the way,
<BR>
3D acceleartion will finally be a reality for the Alpha.  (Currently I do all
<BR>
my stuff on the 3dfx series of 3d accelerators, but from the looks of it Glide
<BR>
is not going to make it to the Alpha anytime soon.  A true shame.)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I've heard a lot of people having problems with what seem like
<BR>
pretty basic things to me; eg, getting Netscape/Mozilla to run properly (it's
<BR>
buggy enough on the x86!), or Gnome running slowly.  There are also some small
<BR>
niceties missing - for example, AGP video, which makes a big difference in
<BR>
screen update time when panning around a nearly full-screen image in the Gimp
<BR>
in my prefered screen mode, 1280x1024x[16|24].
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So - is it worth it?  Will I see enough of a speedup from a (say) PII-266
<BR>
to a 21164-533?  What about from a PII-450 to a 21164-533?  Better yet, what's
<BR>
going to make the difference in speed - would it be better to go up in mhz
<BR>
(say, to 600 or more) or to get a motherboard with more cache?  I'm already
<BR>
planning on UW-SCSI and at least 256 megs of RAM, of course.
<BR>
<P>I'd like to hear both sides to this story, and I'm sure others would as well.
<BR>
I've always thought of Alpha as sort of a holy grail to deliver Linux users
<BR>
from the chains of x86, but lurking on this list has disillusioned me a little
<BR>
bit.  So convince me - you guys are using Alphas, so you must like 'em. :)
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
Adam
