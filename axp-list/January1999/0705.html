<P>the 21264 is the first alpha which supports out-of-order execution. what
<BR>
this means, roughly, is that within a group of instructions fetched
<BR>
from memory, if the first one is still waiting on a dependancy (e.g. a
<BR>
load instruction -- slow!), it can go ahead and take the next 4
<BR>
instructions in line, and come back to the first one once the dependancy
<BR>
is satisfied.  the 21164 and previous would simply wait until the first
<BR>
instruction is ready to execute, doing nothing in the meantime.
<BR>
<P>however, the processor still has to ensure that the execution behaves
<BR>
exactly as if the instructions were executed in their specified order.
<BR>
imagine trying to keep track of many in-flight instructions and once and
<BR>
complete them all in-order by hand ... it is not a simple task!  (i've
<BR>
done it)  so, while the 21264 is much more flexible in execution than the
<BR>
21164, it still has very little knowledge to work with.  by contrast, the
<BR>
compiler knows much more about what instructions are interchangeable, etc.
<BR>
the compiler also doesn't have buffer limitations, so it can look at much
<BR>
larger sections of code in order to re-order instructions.  that is why
<BR>
(particularly on the alpha), it will always help to have a better
<BR>
compiler.
