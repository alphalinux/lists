<P>
<EM>&gt; Thanks for the reply.  I just checked the mouse and keybord at your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggestion.  I had them in the correct holes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But before I go spend big bucks on a video card,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; let me ask a question about memory.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I found out that this alpha needs parity memory from a previous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; posting...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but I bought used memory chips.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How do I know for sure that I got parity chips?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If even one of the four chips is not parity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will that cause the blank screen that I'm getting?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Or is my blank screen for sure associated with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; video card?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; --Ray
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>My Multia UDB did the same blank screen thing with the wrong memory. 
<BR>
Even some known good parity (old IBM parity memory) didn't work in 
<BR>
it. On the UDB there is an LED on the back that flashes the error 
<BR>
code and it was a memory error. When I finally got some good 
<BR>
(actually genuine DEC) memory it came up just fine. I can't speak for 
<BR>
your video problem since my video is built in but memory can make it 
<BR>
just sit there.
<BR>
<P>I had 9 chip 8M simms that didn't work, 12 chip 4M simms that did 
<BR>
(but only 16M total) and finally DEC 9 chip 16M simms that worked. I 
<BR>
know I have seen mention of using 12 chip 16M simms but those are an 
<BR>
older design. I still never figured out why it didn't like the 9 
<BR>
chip 8M simms, they were genuine IBM straight out of a PS/2 which 
<BR>
also requires parity memory and they worked fine in it.
