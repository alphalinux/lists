<EM>&gt; Might sound like a silly question, but if this is known for a long time

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux/Alpha must be already a pretty damn stable and bugfree system. For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; example, also the problems that some versions of the X-server had running
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;= 16bpp never made it there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Reporting and fixing all those long known &quot;features&quot; via updates could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pretty helpful !! Huuhu, RedHat, can you hear us ???
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Would it probably be a good idea to set up an independent list of all KNOWN
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AlphaLinux bugs and their fixes ?? Maybe a FEP = &quot;Frequently encountered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problems&quot; ??
</EM><BR>
<P>I think there are several problems; not just RedHat.  It seems to me that
<BR>
the Linux/AXP userbase has boomed beyond the rate of software to properly
<BR>
support it.  Many of the problems we are seeing here on this list (over and
<BR>
over and over, such as ipfwadm, syslog, xntpd, aboot, XFree86, smbmount,
<BR>
qt, etc etc) are not the fault of RedHat.  Most are either: poor or
<BR>
non-64bit clean programming, Linux kernel bugs, or Alpha-specific changes
<BR>
in development tools (like compiler or binutils).  We can't blame RedHat
<BR>
for the problems, but we can blame them for not acknowledging them and/or
<BR>
making efforts to see them resolved by the owner.  In the case of the
<BR>
ipfwadm bug, yeah, it's really old.  I found the cause and the solution
<BR>
months ago and posted it here and to RedHat.
<BR>
<P>I agree with Joachim on taking action.  We need to come together a bit more
<BR>
and start actively maintaining a list of known Linux/AXP bugs, regardless
<BR>
of distribution.  Each problem should have a date reported, symptom, and
<BR>
fix (if it exists).
<BR>
<P>I would nominate the www.alphalinux.org website as a home base (it's so
<BR>
very slick looking, you know!), if the operators do not object.  Will
<BR>
anyone volunteer to maintain such a web page?  I do think it could help to
<BR>
resolve some of our longstanding problems.
<BR>
<P>cheers,
