<P>
<EM>&gt;Why Alpha?  A couple of my development projects need 64bit support.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Most of the rest is security thru obscurity -- few to none of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;script kiddie hacks work on Alphas (they rely on one or more of x86,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;little-endian, 32bit).  This lets me be a little more sloppy in my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;security maintenance and still keep a working system on the public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Internet.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
There has been a little debate on the list lately becuse of this
<BR>
statement. I'll defend it too :)
<BR>
<P>It is sort of true that using an Alpha over Intel is security through
<BR>
obscurity. 
<BR>
<P>However, I'll tell you what .. if I wanted root on most anyone's machine
<BR>
bad enough, I could probably get it.. even people that follow CERT
<BR>
religiously and who patch every known hole in the software and OS.
<BR>
<P>How? The hardware is probably insecure. I walk into your house, sit at
<BR>
the console and boot to a floppy. I have root. I mount your partition,
<BR>
change /etc/shadow, and reboot. You are hosed. If you have a BIOS password
<BR>
it'll take me a few more minutes to pull the CMOS RAM battery .. but
<BR>
if I have the console, I basically have root. Most people have little, if
<BR>
any, home security. 
<BR>
<P>Now, I don't want to get off on a security tangent here.. but this is a
<BR>
parallel to Intel/Alpha security issues.
<BR>
<P>Most attackers who will break into your home don't give a crap about root.
<BR>
They'll take the machine itself, pawn it off and they don't need root. 
<BR>
Most attackers who want root, won't break into your home. 
<BR>
<P>Therefore to keep someone from getting root on your box, you don't need to
<BR>
live on a military base and keep your machine in a bank vault. Physical
<BR>
compromise isn't a likely attack scenario for most people.
<BR>
<P>Similarly, for many servers, scripted attacks are the only ones they have
<BR>
to worry about. For the guys that can get into any box because they write
<BR>
the scripts to begin with, they will have more interesting targets. They
<BR>
aren't in the attack scenario.. script kiddies running around with the
<BR>
new 0-day DoS attack are the ones that will likely hit your machine. 
<BR>
<P>Using an Alpha stops them. 
<BR>
<P>If you're protecting nuclear launch codes, you're working in a different
<BR>
model .. if you're just trying to run a box to keep a smooth internet
<BR>
connection going, and don't necessarily have secrets to hide, protecting
<BR>
from script kiddies is fine, so long as you don't make for yourself some
<BR>
intelligent enemies and change your threat model all around again.
<BR>
<P>Myself, I have known vunerabilities in software that I use. I accept these
<BR>
vunerabilities because the only two users of the machine are myself and
<BR>
a trusted friend (who has root via sudo anyhow .. so if he really wants
<BR>
to get flashy and get a root shell through a 'sploit instead .. who
<BR>
cares?). So, I don't worry about local attacks .. instead I keep remote
<BR>
access tied down. SSH happens to be the only way in from unknown networks,
<BR>
and telnet w/ OPIE is as good as it gets for trusted networks.. all other
<BR>
daemons are firewalled. And, really, OPIE would be good enough for me ..
<BR>
but I like playing with crypto so I set SSH up just to do it. A different
<BR>
threat model than if I had a hundred and twenty users to worry about.  
<BR>
<P>Real security is about balancing use vs. security.. because, if you pursue
<BR>
&quot;security&quot; (paranoia is a better word) fully, you'll bury your box under
<BR>
30 feet of concrete and steel with no network connection and no users (not
<BR>
even yourself). Because as long as there _is_ a way in, there is a
<BR>
possibility for unauthorized access. 
<BR>
<P>It's all about threats and acceptable models for an application, folks..
<BR>
not some imaginary end of &quot;absolute security&quot; .. it doesn't exist.. for
<BR>
reasons closely tied to stuff like Godel's Incompleteness Theorem or 
<BR>
Turing's Halting Problem.. its just something you have to live with.
<BR>
<P>Now, I better cover this now, because someone invariably says it .. the
<BR>
OTP is an absolutably secure cryptosystem, yes. But an OTP doesn't help
<BR>
you when an attacker takes some .. compromising pictures .. of your
<BR>
secretary or attorney, or .... and gets her to steal the pad. Its only
<BR>
absolutably secure in a given model, namely in a model where eavesdropping
<BR>
on the ciphertext and even some (or all) knowledge of the plaintext is
<BR>
the only attacks. An OTP gives no message authentication .. if you're
<BR>
worried about that sort of thing, you need to use a MAC too.. it doesn't
<BR>
help against bribery or torture. 
<BR>
<P>You have to pick your likely threats.
