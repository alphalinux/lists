Hi!
<BR>
<P>As I bought Alpha only recently, just a few comments.
<BR>
[snip]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; probably $1000.  The basic Alpha system I'm looking at (533 mhz
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 21164) is probably going to cost me well over double that.
</EM><BR>
<P>Obviously you're thinking about LX or UX. I'm, for one, bought SX - it's a bit
<BR>
cheaper. You probably want to look in comp.os.linux.alpha - there is some
<BR>
discussion going on about cheapest way to build an Alpha system.
<BR>
<P>Sorry don't have experience with apps yet.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    So - is it worth it?  Will I see enough of a speedup from a (say) PII-266
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to a 21164-533?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I safely should say - it depends :-) For example, as you mentioned
<BR>
an intensive math - I see a clear difference for FEM package I'm using between
<BR>
PII-350 and my SX533. However, it might be rather specific - iterations
<BR>
to get smaller difference between large float values are very sensitive to
<BR>
32/64 floating of course.
<BR>
I suppose applications shouldn't be too faster unless package is rewritten
<BR>
for Alpha ?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  What about from a PII-450 to a 21164-533?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd expect that most of applications won't see a difference larger then a few %
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've always thought of Alpha as sort of a holy grail to deliver Linux users
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from the chains of x86, but lurking on this list has disillusioned me a little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bit.  So convince me - you guys are using Alphas, so you must like 'em. :)
</EM><BR>
<P>:-) We like them not (only) because they can run similar appls as Intel can.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Adam
</EM><BR>
<P>So, for me it's a floating math and 64 bit.
<BR>
<P>Andrei
