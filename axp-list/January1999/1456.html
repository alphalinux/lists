<P>
<EM>&gt;If this is a Digital Personal Workstation 500a,... you'll have to give
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;up using the onboard ethernet if you want two ethernet interfaces. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problem you describe is well known... and there is hint that it may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fixed in a firmware update... so try that.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>When I realized that I reasponded to a two month old mail, I said, &quot;oops&quot;,
<BR>
but I guess your problem hasn't been solved.
<BR>
<P>You probably misunderstood my response, as I have successfully installed a
<BR>
second functioning Tulip card in my computer.  My system is the DPWS 500a,
<BR>
it has always used AlphaBIOS 5.65 and above, the firmware always recognized
<BR>
both chips.  The firmware update process seemed painless to me.  I had a
<BR>
little trouble getting Linux to use both properly, but a Linux guy helped
<BR>
me and we found that the de4x5 driver does the trick.
<BR>
<P>If you still have trouble, please email me personally if you want.  If your
<BR>
firmware upgrade simply barfs, maybe you should contact your vendor or DEC
<BR>
itself.
<BR>

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I have the PWS 500a, and I've tried a million different things to try to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;work with the onboard ethernet and another tulip card I installed. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;also tried installing a 3com card... but still the same problem. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;eventually gave up and installed both the tulip card and 3com card and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disabled the onboard ethernet chip. You're probably noticing that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;onboard ethernet starts spitting packets out like mad... and then dying.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I've tried all combinations of compiling the drivers as modules and in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the kernel... no luck. I've also tried several versions of the tulip
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;drivers... but after I noticed the same problem with the 3c59x driver, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;realized it wasn't a driver problem... there is just something funky
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about that onboard 21143 tulip chip.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sorry, this isn't good news. But at least you know.... however, there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are hints in the latest firmware update that might fix this.... so give
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that a try. I haven't yet tried it,.. as on my first attempt, it failed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to update the firmware.... if you have better luck, please let us know.
</EM><BR>
