Good Morning,
<BR>
<P><P>I'm new to alpha's, but a seasoned amateur of Linux (four and half months
<BR>
or so).  
<BR>
<P>I couldn't get any of the experimental kernel's to compile on this SX164
<BR>
(533 MHZ), so I just got 2.0.36, compiled it without trouble.  It has the
<BR>
EIDE controller in it, with a Maxtor 7 gig HD.  The computer was is sort
<BR>
of a proprietary machine, not direct from DEC (it's a long story, don't
<BR>
ask ;)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;After the initial re-boot with this new kernel, I was swamped with
<BR>
messages of Unexpected interrupts for interrupts 3, 4, 14, and 15 (ttys01,
<BR>
ttys02, ide0, and ide1 respectively).  These messages popped up as the
<BR>
kernel attempted to initialize the floppy, the mouse, and the HD, and the
<BR>
cdrom.  This didn't seem to affect anything much, but I couldn't mount my
<BR>
floppy drive (it would just sit there with the light turned on).  Anyway,
<BR>
I got rid of the Unexpected Interrupt messages by adding the lines
<BR>
&quot;ide0=0x1f0,0x3f6,14 ide1=0x170,0x376,15&quot;  to the milo boot options
<BR>
under the WinNT Alpha Bios.  So Kernel boots clean (still
<BR>
get ONE unexpected message right after mouse on interrupt 14??).  If it
<BR>
helps, I'm still using the original milo which came on the redhat cd's
<BR>
(built under 2.0.35, would that have anything to do with it?)
<BR>
<P>BUT, &quot;mount /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy&quot; still begins to access the floppy and
<BR>
never finishes (I let it go 2 hours before removing the disk).  Funny
<BR>
thing, when using the Redhat alpha kernel (2.0.35, came with redhat 5.2),
<BR>
it works fine.  Other notes, the drive is a 2.88M Mitsumi model d359m3.
<BR>
At least that's what the kernel says (&quot;fd0 is 2.88M; Floppy drive is Post
<BR>
1991).
<BR>
<P>For kernel compiling options, I did select the normal floppy thing.
<BR>
<P>I would like to continue using the self-compiled kernel (I get sound, and
<BR>
best of all it's CUSTOMIZED;)
<BR>
<P>Suggestions, comments, help?  
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
<P>Jano
