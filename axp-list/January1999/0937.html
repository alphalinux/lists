Hello all,
<BR>
<P>I was on the list a few weeks ago with several
<BR>
problems with a Cabriolet that wouldn't boot,
<BR>
not even the video.  While I got off the list I didn't
<BR>
give up on the problems.
<BR>
<P>Those that responded from the list were very responsive
<BR>
to my problem and made very good suggestions and statements
<BR>
of support.  Thanks
<BR>
<P>Well I'm happy to say that one or two of the problems
<BR>
was solved by taking the board over to where I bought
<BR>
the memory and swapping out memory chips until
<BR>
I got a good set of true parity memory sticks.
<BR>
<P>So I can boot now!  Yeaa!
<BR>
<P>But while the skies have cleared a little, the day is not
<BR>
sunny yet.
<BR>
<P>I trying to use a Mylex Buslogic Flashpoint SCSI adapter
<BR>
to boot my system.  I'm pretty sure I have the hard
<BR>
drive set for the proper ID and terminated.
<BR>
<P>I'm using MILO to boot the &quot;cabrio.img&quot; file from the
<BR>
RedHat 5.2 Alpha distribution.
<BR>
<P>The problem is that the boot file says that Buslogic
<BR>
Flashpoint is not compiled into the kernel.
<BR>
<P>And I can't find a ReadMe file on the CD under &quot;images&quot;
<BR>
or &quot;kernels&quot; that tells me if there is an alternative kernel
<BR>
I can use that does have the Buslogic driver built in.
<BR>
<P>Does any one know if there is such a beast somewhere
<BR>
and where I might go look for it?
<BR>
<P>TIA
<BR>
<P><P><PRE>
