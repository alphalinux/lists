<P>
Hi,
<BR>
<P>I've got an PC164UX-2 Motherboard (from Samsung) with
<BR>
a 21164a with 533 Mhz.
<BR>
<P>My Problem is that it seems I don't get any IRQs from
<BR>
the parallel (printer) port (0x378, IRQ 7).
<BR>
<P>I've asked this before, but I did some reality checks
<BR>
in the meantime.
<BR>
<P>What I did was to connect a PC (i386) box to the alpha
<BR>
machine, because I wanted to transfer data over an
<BR>
parallel laplink cable. It didn't work.
<BR>
<P>When I looked in /proc/interrupts I saw the IRQ 7 was
<BR>
there, but with a count of 0.
<BR>
<P>I'm quite sure that the cable is OK (it just works,
<BR>
when I connect it to another i86).
<BR>
<P>I tried with 2.0.35 and 2.2.0-pre7/6 Kernels.
<BR>
<P>(I compiled with a &quot;Ruffian&quot; setup. When I tried to compile
<BR>
&nbsp;with &quot;Generic&quot; the kernel would hang in the boot procedure.)
<BR>
<P>I also had a look at the plip source code of 2.0.35 and I'm quite
<BR>
convinced that it SHOULD work. (It seems interrupts
<BR>
are turned on correctly, the handler is installed correctly
<BR>
...)
<BR>
<P>So at the moment I suspect that my Motherboard has a defect.
<BR>
(Some Pin broken or something like that). 
<BR>
<P>But before I go to my vendor and complain I would like
<BR>
to know if anyone else got it working. (Which means has
<BR>
someone checked if there are interrupts arriving ?
<BR>
If you got a printer and a 2.2.0-pre7 it's easy to
<BR>
check, because you only have to provide an IRQ to
<BR>
parport_pc and it will use an interrupt driven handler.)
<BR>
<P>Please, if someone got a PC164UX board could you check
<BR>
and tell me ? (I know this is not really a serious problem,
<BR>
but it really makes me nervous to not know what's going on.)
<BR>
<P>so long
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ingo
<BR>
<P><PRE>
