<P>
<EM>&gt; One tiny correction: including load/store, alpha 21164 can execute up 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to *four* floating-point instructions per cycle.  Which is how Goto's
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm. Have a reference for this? The 500Mhz 21164a is rated for
<BR>
close to one GFLOPS per second per processor, which I thought could be
<BR>
explained by one FADD, one FMUL per clock cycle (0.5Gc*2).   
<BR>
<EM>&gt; gemm inner loop gets so close to two floating-point *operations* per
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cycle- one add and one multiply.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Also, Daniel, does your high regard for SGI Origin take price into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consideration?  We've found that Origin nodes cost roughly five times
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as much as
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eh, sir? Please re-read my message.  My &quot;platform of choice&quot; is
<BR>
constrained by what we have available - an 8 proc Origin2k and 4 proc
<BR>
Onyx2 RE2.  If I were running the &quot;show&quot; and independently wealthy, there
<BR>
certainly would be a stack of DEC systems in place of the SGIs.  But I'm
<BR>
not, nor do I forsee funding for an Alpha solution in the near future.
<BR>
(On the side, we are designing a concept Beowulf cluster from junked PC's
<BR>
in hopes of obtaining funding for an AlphaLinux cluster but that is in the
<BR>
distant future).
<BR>
<EM>&gt; alphas with roughly the same fp performance, and for matrix multiply and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; related (e.g. LU decomposition) our alphas are about four times faster!
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, I would prefer a cluster of alphas to an Origin any day.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; And SGI memory prices are absolutely outrageous.  If they were similarly
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No quarrel here. 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; priced, the Origin's memory architecture for SMP might be worth the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speed penalty of individual processors, but they're not...
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits of Origin scalability may be overshadowed by the raw
<BR>
horsepower per node of an Alpha cluster.  This has always be a paradox
<BR>
when determining target equipment for floating-point intense algorithmic
<BR>
analyses or other computations: Single Fast or Several Slow.  The cluster
<BR>
of 12 Alphas strung together by 100Tx ethernet (or SCSI, if you're a Real
<BR>
Programmer) will always win the cost-performance analysis compared to a
<BR>
12-processor SGI or other MP machine.  Plus, expanding your virtual
<BR>
parallel computer is as simple as plugging another compute node into the
<BR>
hub with an AlphaCluster (hey, a new term) solution - upgrading the Origin
<BR>
is costly to say the least. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyhow, I hope that clears up that.  No idea how you extrapolated
<BR>
that I have such high regards for the Origin; again, it is simply what we
<BR>
have available to work with.  I purchased an Alpha so I can have the
<BR>
capability to do fp-intense things at home and not rely completely on the
<BR>
work-provided solution.
<BR>
<P>Best regards,
<BR>
Daniel
