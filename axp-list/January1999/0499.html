I've also been trying to get DHCP working on my box.  So far I have dhcpcd-0.70 
<BR>
working with kernel 2.2.0-pre3.  I have to do a
<BR>
`route add default gw &lt;gateway-addr&gt;` after dhcpcd &quot;fails&quot; to actually get 
<BR>
routing to work (dhcpcd will get an IP address and then fail to set the default 
<BR>
route), but it does work.

<EM>&gt; &gt; The one from rawhide.redhat.com doesn't work for me...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is not supposed to. It should be something on the topic in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Documentation/Changes or other files there.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, it is dhcpcd-1.3.16-2.alpha.rpm, so it SHOULD be recent enough.
<BR>
Is there some other reason why it shouldn't work?  (The same version compiled 
<BR>
from the .tar.gz has the same results.)
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; First of all you have to turn it on by doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_bootp_agent
</EM><BR>
<P>That's what the ISC's documentation says, at least.  The problem is that 
<BR>
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_bootp_agent does not exist since 2.1.117 (which is the 
<BR>
earliest version I tried.)  This is either because it's no longer necessary or 
<BR>
because I cannot for the life of me figure out what kernel config option turns 
<BR>
it on.  Is anyone else missing this option?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; somewhere in your startup files.  The second you likely need another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; client (and, possibly, also ipchains).
</EM><BR>
<P>I've tried every client I can get my hands on, from dhcpcd-0.70 through 
<BR>
dhcpcd-1.3.16, and several versions of the ISC client.  In some cases, the 
<BR>
client just dies with an error message that I can't remember just now, in other 
<BR>
cases it just does nothing and emits no errors, and with recent kernels it 
<BR>
assigns an IP address but fails to set the default route, getting an &quot;operation 
<BR>
not permitted&quot; error.  (Note that by &quot;recent kernels&quot; I mean 2.2.0-pre3, which
<BR>
is what I'm running right now, and dhcpcd-0.70.  Apparently they re-added 
<BR>
support for the obsolete raw socket access that dhcpcd-0.70 requires.) 
<BR>
dhcpcd-1.3.16 does nothing, and times out after failing to find a DHCP server.
<BR>
<P>My understanding of ipchains is that it's a firewall utility.  Does it have 
<BR>
some impact on DHCP support as well?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; In general 2.1/2.2 kernels require various changes and expecting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that everything will work without spending some time reading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; documentation has to end in failures.
</EM><BR>
<P>Unfortunately, in this case the documentation isn't good enough;  the ISC's 
<BR>
documentation for their client, for example, only refers to fairly early 
<BR>
development kernels, whereas recent kernels do not seem to have the 
<BR>
ip_bootp_agent sysctl option.  This has also become a minor FAQ on the kernel 
<BR>
list, and the answer is always &quot;get the latest client&quot;, which fails to help.  
<BR>
I, at least, am stumped.
<BR>
<P>Hopefully using dhcpcd-0.70 with the `route` command above will at least get 
<BR>
you working.
