<EM>&gt; Anyone tried using rxvt on alpha?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I am using it all the time for some years (on alpha).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm on kernel 2.1.131 w/ac11. Rxvt 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keeps crashing with segmentation fault and core dump.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is probably a long list of different versions of rxvt, recompiled
<BR>
with different headers and so on.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I recompiled from source (with -g, no -O?), same problem. Then I tried 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to debug, but I'm not an expert with gdb (can anyone help?).
</EM><BR>
<P>Type 'info gdb'.  There are also some graphic front ends to gdb
<BR>
(like xgdb - if my memory serves me right).  It is also a good idea
<BR>
to run gdb from emacs (M-x gdb); gdb has extensive on-line help.
<BR>
gdb can be also attached to an already running process ('help attach'
<BR>
at gdb prompt).
<BR>
<P>BTW - it is usually a good idea to compile for debugging with -O2,
<BR>
or at least -O, flag; but not with -fomit-frame-pointer.  Once you
<BR>
will gain some experience with debugging with gdb you will see why.
<BR>
True, some variables may &quot;disappear&quot; but gains are bigger than
<BR>
losses.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I got a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; message saying &quot;dl-debug.c: file does not exist&quot; when i tried a 'list' 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; after rxvt seg faults.
</EM><BR>
<P>Does it exist?  Maybe you have to add a directory to a list of
<BR>
directories searched ('help dir' at gdb prompt).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I tried a 'info line *0x????????' on the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; addresses that were outputed by gdb. This got me the message: &quot;no line 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; info for 0x???????&quot;. Backtrace didn't give anything useful either.
</EM><BR>
<P>This sounds like one of two classics:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- either there is &quot;off-by-one&quot; error somewhere and you write
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;past memory you allocated in a form of an automatic array on stack
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- or somebody is passing int to a function which expects long
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or vice-versa (this bug is masked on Intel processor as long and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int happen there to have the same size) or something of a similar
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kind.
<BR>
In both cases you already messed up your stack and an information
<BR>
you are trying to read is garbled and invalid.  You have to stop
<BR>
the whole process before that and trace down, step-by-step, to find out
<BR>
what is killing your stack.  Attaching 'strace' to your process and
<BR>
analizing its output while you performed actions leading to a crash
<BR>
can be of help here.
<BR>
<P>There are other ways to kill your stack but the two above are the
<BR>
most popular.  There can be a bad interaction with your kernel
<BR>
(some structures are misaligned) but in theory rxvt is a user space
<BR>
application and it should not care at all what kernel you are
<BR>
running.  This theory may be not entirely true in practice :-) but
<BR>
rxvt is not something which has to mess up with network packets,
<BR>
or something of that sort, so the theory should generally apply.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Anyways... I'm going to try to figure out how to use gdb better... but 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the mean time, does anyone know of this problem already? And is there 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a fix? Any suggestions on using gdb?
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a bit of mystery as I am using rxvt with various Red Hat
<BR>
distributions and I never seen something even close.  When you ask
<BR>
questions like that an information about your enviroment and versions
<BR>
of things you are using can be a crucial one.  It is missing from
<BR>
what you posted.
