<P>Right, 2 FLOPS = floating point *operations* per clock, i.e. one add and one
<BR>
multiply.  But if this were all you could do, you'd real fast run out of
<BR>
registers to add and multiply together, and would not get anywhere near the
<BR>
theoretical 2 operations/clock on a sustained basis.  So, four *instructions*
<BR>
per clock refers to these two plus two loads and/or stores to feed the
<BR>
registers, which don't count in FLOPS numbers.  The assembly source of K.
<BR>
Goto's gemm is a great place to see this in action- the inner loop comes very
<BR>
close to 2 FLOPS/clock, and the whole thing sustains an average of about
<BR>
1.5-1.6 FLOPS/clock, which is very good.  (I think it's slightly faster than
<BR>
the DU gemm, but don't quote me on that.)
<BR>
<P>Alpha is pretty amazing, isn't it?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Also, Daniel, does your high regard for SGI Origin take price into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; consideration?  We've found that Origin nodes cost roughly five times
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as much as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         Eh, sir? Please re-read my message.  My &quot;platform of choice&quot; is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constrained by what we have available - an 8 proc Origin2k and 4 proc
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Onyx2 RE2.
