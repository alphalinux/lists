<P>
Zeen,
<BR>
<P>UPDATE: matroxfb works in *text mode* on 164LX with Millennium II, 4 MB VRAM, 2.2.0
<BR>
and 2.2.0-final (since sound is broken on 2.2.0).  Text modes that worked for me:
<BR>
video=matrox:vesa:0x108 or 0x10B or 0x10C (i.e. 640x480, 1056x400, 1056x480; though
<BR>
0x10C seems to only work on reboot, not on initial BIOS/ARC startup).  You don't get
<BR>
the penguin in these text modes, but all of them allow quite a bit more text than
<BR>
the standard VGA console.
<BR>
<P>One problem: when dropping out of X (3.3.3-1, SVGA mode, 1600x1200 16 bpp), I get a
<BR>
blank or solid-colored screen which persists for quite a while.  Switching consoles
<BR>
around (e.g. alt-F2) got me back, but I haven't had the patience to drop out of X
<BR>
and let it sit long enough to come back on its own. :-)

<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;         There is currently a matroxfb in development which provides

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; partial acceleration for the console framebuffer.  It can be found in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; cvs right now, and will probably be a part of 2.1.129.  It doesn't work on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Alphas at the moment, but I'm working with the author to remedy that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; situation; Petr has been very helpful and cooperative so far.

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Cool!  Any progress in the last two months?  I tried building 2.2.0-final with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; matroxfb and booting, but no dice, even with video=vc.  Same problem as others
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on this list: I get the first line of kernel output then it dies, regardless of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the video variable I give it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Which processor does this work under? I tried building on my avanti only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to discover that there was no matrox option in the framebuffer section,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only a tga. This is the one great thing in my opinion that sucks really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hard under alphas right now. :(
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   If I knew anything about coding framebuffer stuff, I'd be more than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; willing to help.

<P>You have to set CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL which is the first question in make config.
<BR>
Then after answering &quot;Y&quot; to CONFIG_FB, CONFIG_FB_MATROX should be the second option
<BR>
that comes up.  (Funny- it doesn't *say* &quot;EXPERIMENTAL&quot;, but it's pretty clear from
<BR>
the Config.in that you need it.)  If you want to boot with fbcon, answer &quot;Y&quot; not
<BR>
&quot;M&quot;.  Then there are four sub-options for Matrox drivers.
<BR>
<P>My compressed kernel is only 47K larger with matroxfb compiled in than with no frame
<BR>
buffer.  Pretty cool!!  When it really works for alpha, I'd love to see some apps
<BR>
for the framebuffer.  Or could an alternate gdk wrapper be written for it, so GIMP
<BR>
and most of GNOME could run without X?  Or does one need something like GGI or
<BR>
kgicon?  Or does Adam not know what he's talking about? :-)
<BR>
<P>For those really interested in fb development...  Trolling through linux-kernel
<BR>
archives, I found an announcement of a couple of weeks ago from Geert Uytterhoeven
<BR>
of a new linux-fbdev list.  To join, send mailto:<A HREF="mailto:Majordmo@vu.union.edu?subject=Re:%20fbcon">Majordmo@vu.union.edu</A> with message
<BR>
body &quot;subscribe linux-fbdev&quot;.  No word on an archive (yet... I'm going to ask and
<BR>
will post if I get a reply).
