<P>
I would like to find out why too!
<BR>
<P>I had the same problem with glint on my RedHat 5.2 installation on an 
<BR>
alpha SX164. Except I was trying to uninstall packages using glint. 
<BR>
&nbsp;After clicking on uninstall, there is some activity on the disk &amp; 
<BR>
then all is silent and glint hangs. After killing &amp; restarting glint, 
<BR>
the packages I selected for uninstall are indeed removed. But why does 
<BR>
glint hang in the process?
<BR>

<P>I got a preinstalled AlphaPC164UX Computer two days ago and it seemed 
<BR>
to
<BR>
work fine, it still is. But I tried to install some new rpm packages 
<BR>
and
<BR>
I somehow got error messages from the computer.
<BR>
<P>First I tried to use &quot;glint&quot; to manage the packages and I could see 
<BR>
all
<BR>
of the installed ones in there without any problems. I then tried to
<BR>
install another package, but it didn't want to work. The installation
<BR>
window somehow hang up and the only thing I cold do was to press the 
<BR>
x
<BR>
in the upper right hand corner. Funny enough the package later on
<BR>
appeared in the glint window after restarting glint. But I realised 
<BR>
that
<BR>
much later.
