Dunno about afordable, but Symbios have a 64bit PCI card - dual SCSI Ultra-2
<BR>
LVD (might be the 53c896 chip? not sure, I'm offline at the moment). You almost
<BR>
need it for that card - consider the potential bandwidth for 2x80MB/s SCSI
<BR>
chains - total is 160MB/s, and 32bit PCI only has 132MB/s peak bandwidth. I'd
<BR>
hardly think the disk subsystem you would need to justify such a beast would be
<BR>
even remotely affordable though :-)
<BR>
<P>(Let me see - really fast disks are getting more than 16MB/s sustained transfer
<BR>
rate these days, so maybe 10 of them (ouch!), 5 on each chain. You'd probably
<BR>
need some sort of multiplexing raid controllers between you and the drives
<BR>
though, since I have never been able to get more than about 75% of the
<BR>
theoretical bandwidth of a SCSI chain when using multiple devices (I guess you
<BR>
get too much contention on the bus or something). I've no idea what you would
<BR>
do with that rate of data; even an Alpha is going to have a hard time doing
<BR>
anything sensible with it!)
<BR>
<P>64bit graphics cards might make sense, except that the market seems to have
<BR>
gone for AGP (are they planning AGP on future Alpha boards?). Gigabit ethernet
<BR>
might also be able to make use of more than the 32bit PCI limitations, and I
<BR>
guess you might consider it for multi-port 100Mbit cards as well (but probably
<BR>
only for more than 5 ports at a guess).
<BR>
<P>Of course, 32 bit cards work fine in 64 bit slots...

<P><P><EM>&gt; Hallo !
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A few days ago I added a sound card and recognized that my LX-board has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only left two 64 bit PCI slots for upgrading (both ISA and 32 bit PCI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slots are used up). I checked several webpages if there are any 64 bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cards at all but only found diagnostic cards.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So a question from the curious (as of now): Are there any 64 bit PCI cards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like network, graphics, SCSI or simmilar for affordable prices ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks for the info.
