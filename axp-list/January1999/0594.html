<EM>&gt; &gt; Why does it take up to 50% longer sometimes? (it really

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That really depends on the nature of `core()',
</EM><BR>
<P>core() is actually core(n). It only depends on
<BR>
n. no other variables. so it calculates exactly
<BR>
the same for every run of my testprogram.
<BR>
<P>the core is mostly unconditional, but i had a test
<BR>
to the end of the core which would skip some 300
<BR>
instructions if a certain condition is true.
<BR>
<P>i took this out, so now the core has no
<BR>
conditional code at all. i would expect, that
<BR>
it takes the same amount of ops every time.
<BR>
(calculations like &quot;c=a+b&quot; take up the same amount
<BR>
of time, no matter what the values of a and b are.
<BR>
right?)
<BR>
<P>I'm not shure, if the behavior of my program really
<BR>
changed (maybe it's just that my computer was less
<BR>
busy), but i hat to run my speedtest about 30 times
<BR>
to get some runs which were slower. Mostly the
<BR>
minimum was around 6300, but there are some runs
<BR>
where the min was more than 7000...
<BR>
<P>Min=6317 Avg=6425

Min=6319 Avg=6429

<P><EM>&gt; (1) page faulting, though that would surely only explain a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     higher average, not minimum.
</EM><BR>
<P>My computer has 256MB RAM and right now it uses 200MB for
<BR>
cacheing. I don't expect it to do pageing (the testprogram
<BR>
is about 60kB in size and uses about 32kB for its variables).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (2) page colouring.  this affects the efficiency of the caches.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     there is no way under linux to control your page colour.
</EM><BR>
<P>What is page colouring? Could you explain this or do you
<BR>
know where I can read about it?
<BR>
<P><P>Thanks a lot Mr. Henderson. It's always a pleasure to learn
<BR>
from people which know more than one self :)
