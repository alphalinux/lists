<P>
I just got hold of an S3 Virge DX card with 4MB which I managed to
<BR>
shoehorn into my UDB.  Currently running it at 1024x768 32 bit and it is
<BR>
running very nicely.  The card is actually about 1cm too long but I
<BR>
managed to slide the end of the card between the floppy and HD!
<BR>
<P>Anyway, a couple of things.  I have recompiled my kernel not to have TGA
<BR>
support but when the machine boots it still comes up on the TGA and the S3
<BR>
doesn't start until Xdm kicks in.  Second, there is the problem of only
<BR>
being able to have 20 or so windows open with the RedHat 5.1 driver, is
<BR>
this fixed in 5.2?  If not, I remember someone had a site with fixed
<BR>
drivers for alpha but I didn't keep the URL (Doh!).
<BR>
<P>Still, nice to have 16 million colours on a UDB!  Doesn't half make the
<BR>
machine feel fast.  Adding another 64MB of main memory this well along
<BR>
with a 15&quot; LCD panel, should make for a very sweet little machine.
