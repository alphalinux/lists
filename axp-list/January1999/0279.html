<P>
<EM>&gt; Alpha (trial). It works fine EXCEPT sevel (totally unrelated) programs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like latex, xosview just dump core (as soon as sound stops they run fine).
</EM><BR>
<P>Ahhh... interesting.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Does anyone have any simmilar experiences or can anyone hint by what this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might be caused ?
</EM><BR>
<P>I used to have the exact same sort of problem... any time I play PCM audio,
<BR>
the machine gets all flaky.  Random apps start to segfault or float-point 
<BR>
except, and sometimes, my box locks up hard (if I'm in X).  I reported it
<BR>
to the OSS people, and had a thread going on here for a little while, but to
<BR>
no avail.  The OSS people said &quot;it's the same code as our x86 core, so it 
<BR>
shouldn't matter&quot; and people on this list hadn't seen the behavior.  I am
<BR>
planning, however, to try the new OSS drivers (that just came out a week ago)
<BR>
as soon as I can get to my console (I gotta' pick up my machine from its 
<BR>
winter-vacation home now that I'm back at school).  I'll letcha' know.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have an LX-Board, 128 MB RAM, running Linux 5.2, self-compiled kernel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (2.0.35 as provided on the Red-Hat-CD-ROM) with NE2000-Support but (for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this test) excplicitly set no sound support. When trying the kernel-Sound
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I read the AWE-32-Howto but it mentions an patch which I (ok,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unexperienced) was unable to apply (the special RedHat-Version of that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; patch referred to RedHat 5.0).
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm on a PC164LX, 256MB RAM, RH5.1 based, 2.0.35 (from the gatekeeper source
<BR>
archives) and no sound.  I'm using an AWE64 Gold, and PCM audio, as well as
<BR>
/dev/sequencer traffic (ie, MIDIs or MODs under a player like xmp).  The 
<BR>
behavior seems markedly worse when I have X running, but that could have
<BR>
something to do with the resource utilization, or something.
<BR>
<P>Mind you, I haven't even tried the standard sound drivers 'cause I can never
<BR>
get them to work at all, and I'd rather have broken audio than no audio at 
<BR>
all. =]
