<P>
<EM>&gt; OK... not that I disagree with you completely, and I see your point of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; view, but remember, it was DEC that got bought out by Compaq and Intel. 
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my understanding that DEC licensed the Alpha technology 
<BR>
to Intel when developing Merced specifications, and that Compaq merged
<BR>
with DEC.  AMD has also licensed Alpha technology from DEC, as the K7 
<BR>
is running on the 200Mhz EV6 bus protocol.  Technology and patent
<BR>
cross-licensing is not a bad thing; cross-pollination of x86 and AXP
<BR>
technologies only ensure the future development of Alpha.  
<BR>
<EM>&gt; truly bring it to the market place (where DEC was not so successful). I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guess my point is, a pure geek/technologist attitude won't get a 
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Totally agree and would never suggest otherwise.  Please read
<BR>
below.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; technology off the ground (unfortunately), I'm hoping that Compaq with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there mass marketing experience, will provide the &quot;business&quot; aspect of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; getting this technology out. Just my thoughts...
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two or three years ago, I would have agreed with you outright
<BR>
regarding the need for serious marketing consultation.  However, Linux is
<BR>
now trendy and a marketable commodity among corporate big-wigs.  With an
<BR>
estimated installed base of 10-15 million users (and keep in mind that
<BR>
probably only 50% of Linux /actually/ participate in those polls), Compaq
<BR>
would have been foolish not to throw their support behind Linux.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AlphaLinux is a different story, though.  Whereas Linux is now a 
<BR>
household name thanks to media exposure, AlphaLinux is more obscure due to
<BR>
the lack of good marketing decisions by DEC when Alpha technology first
<BR>
emerged.  DEC has always been funny that way, more reserved in their
<BR>
marketing efforts.  Why? Because Alpha users typically chose DEC
<BR>
technology on the basis of technical merits rather than a marketeer's
<BR>
smooth tounge.  AlphaLinux follows suit similarly, attracting users who
<BR>
are not impressed by dancing Intel engineers in colored spacesuits.  
<BR>
In other words, AlphaLinux does not need the marketing expertise of Compaq
<BR>
to continue as an excellent platform to run Linux on.  What AlphaLinux
<BR>
does need, however, is the /technical/ support of Compaq in the arena of
<BR>
optmized compilers at reasonable price, availability of technical
<BR>
documents, pre-release information for Linux developers, etc.
<BR>
<P>Best regards,
<BR>
Daniel
