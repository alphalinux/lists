<P>
How do,
<BR>
<P>I am having some problems getting my Multia to boot Redhat/Alpha 5.2.  Up
<BR>
until a recent hard disk crash this machine was running RH4.2 happily so I
<BR>
know the machine works.
<BR>
<P>I successfully load the noname milo image, however when trying to load the
<BR>
kernel with a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boot floppy
<BR>
or a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boot fd0:vmlinux.gz root=/dev/fd0 load_ramdisk=1
<BR>
<P>The system then tries to access the boot floppy, immediately fails
<BR>
with a 'fatal error: not enough memory', and locks up the milo
<BR>
console.
<BR>
<P>However this should not be the case, even with only 24Mb of RAM on board.
<BR>
I am using the noname boot image, ramdisk and milo image.  I have
<BR>
also built and tried custom boot kernels (both 2.0.36 and 2.1.131) without
<BR>
any success.
<BR>
<P>In testing the machine I have successfully installed and run NT, which
<BR>
reports the correct amount of RAM and runs as well as expected.
<BR>
<P>I am loath to go to the expense of more memory for a machine that does
<BR>
little more than drive a couple of modems and runs as a firewall as the
<BR>
additional memory is not required for normal operation.  Additionally the
<BR>
kernel should at least be able to boot regardless of what the redhat
<BR>
install wants to do.
<BR>
<P>Has anybody else experienced similar problems with the Mutlia
<BR>
installation/bootup under redhat 5.2 ?  
<BR>
Anybody have any ideas on how to fix it ?
<BR>
Anybody know if there were recent kernel changes that increased the
<BR>
required memory base ?  (It used to work with only 8Meg.  I'll spend the 
<BR>
money if there is a real chance that it will fix the problem.)
<BR>
<P>Thanks
<BR>
Jason.
