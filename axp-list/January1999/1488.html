<EM>&gt; I've only just saved all my hard earned pennies and got myself a UX4
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; based workstation (I assume the UX4 is a 'ruffian', I'm very new to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all the terminology). Currently it only has NT4, but I intend (when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've worked out what the heck MILO/ARCBIOS/other-stuff is) to install
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RedHat as my primary operating system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Am I scuppered? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I thought the UX was the latest greatest 164 system - in which case
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how come it's dead already?
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds strange to me, too. The boards have been around for some time now, but
<BR>
they are not unpopular yet. The massive number of RAM and PCI slots make them
<BR>
very attractive.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm no alpha/linux wiz, is there a simple RH CD set I can literally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; install with one command (I'm not lazy, just dumb) and which will then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work without me having to mother it? I can get access to the RH5.2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all-processor CD set, but have been warned that &quot;it comes with almost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no instructions&quot;, and it's a 2.0.36(?) kernel which I now read is old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hat. Or shall I just use NT for the rest of its life (no, you can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wish that on anyone). 
</EM><BR>
<P>I've installed RH 5.2 on a Ruffian by following the guidelines at

<BR>
<P>2.0.36 is not old, it is just more mature. I wouldn't dare to run 2.2.0 on a
<BR>
production system.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; P.S. I rarely have access to anything more high tech than e-mail, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'downloading the latest patches' is a non-trivial operation.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you cannot access it, I'll email it to you privately.
