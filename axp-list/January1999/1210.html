<EM>&gt;&gt; to write this.

<EM>&gt;I think it is important to state that there always will be people who want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to have some work done with minimum effort possible. If they have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;difficulties with Alpha they switch to Intel expecting less pain (I've no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;idea where they're going if they'll have problems with Intel too). I
</EM><BR>
respect
<BR>
<EM>&gt;them if they are proffesionals in their own job. They would have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;using abacus if there would be no computers around - so what ? It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;impossible to learn all civilization knowledge :-)
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Until there is no anti-development opinion is stated from their site
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I can understand their position completely.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>IIRC, I've had fewer troubles with Alphas than Intel, hardware and
<BR>
software-wise (linux, NT), the only  troubles I've had is getting the
<BR>
kernels, 'foreign' games to work, and installation is a tad more difficult,
<BR>
but then, the way OS's are booted, I believe that there is less chance of
<BR>
screwing up your computer.  As a college student, I am glad I did Alpha as
<BR>
it performs well and greatly reduces the gaming temptation.   I'd snap up
<BR>
an AlphaLinux office suite if I could get a student rate - I haven't
<BR>
looked, but I've done fine with legacy emulation.
