<P>
If this is a Digital Personal Workstation 500a,... you'll have to give 
<BR>
up using the onboard ethernet if you want two ethernet interfaces. The 
<BR>
problem you describe is well known... and there is hint that it may be 
<BR>
fixed in a firmware update... so try that. 
<BR>
<P>But no, compiling the tulip drivers as module or in kernel does not 
<BR>
help. The problem is supposedly related to the way the onboard ethernet 
<BR>
chip was implemented on the board.... Digital (Compaq) has officially 
<BR>
recognized this problem.. or so I recall from a email response from 
<BR>
them. This problem is SPECIFIC to the PWS 500a/au systems.. I guess 
<BR>
600a/au too.. but I've only confirmed with people that have the 500a.
<BR>
<P>I have the PWS 500a, and I've tried a million different things to try to 
<BR>
work with the onboard ethernet and another tulip card I installed. I 
<BR>
also tried installing a 3com card... but still the same problem. I 
<BR>
eventually gave up and installed both the tulip card and 3com card and 
<BR>
disabled the onboard ethernet chip. You're probably noticing that the 
<BR>
onboard ethernet starts spitting packets out like mad... and then dying. 
<BR>
I've tried all combinations of compiling the drivers as modules and in 
<BR>
the kernel... no luck. I've also tried several versions of the tulip 
<BR>
drivers... but after I noticed the same problem with the 3c59x driver, I 
<BR>
realized it wasn't a driver problem... there is just something funky 
<BR>
about that onboard 21143 tulip chip.
<BR>
<P>Sorry, this isn't good news. But at least you know.... however, there 
<BR>
are hints in the latest firmware update that might fix this.... so give 
<BR>
that a try. I haven't yet tried it,.. as on my first attempt, it failed 
<BR>
to update the firmware.... if you have better luck, please let us know. 
<BR>
<P>D.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, I'm using the tulip drivers 0.58H and have them compiled into 
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; kernel (not modules).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Perhaps that's the problem... I have two Tulip-based cards in my Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;and I have that driver as a module.  Once I tried to make a kernel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;with Tulip in it, and network stopped working.  It did show both cards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;but still it either didn't work or worked oddly (the other card 
</EM><BR>
worked,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;the other not or something like that).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;So, my suggestion would be to try it as a module (unless you've tried
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;that already).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Same with me, same machine.  Use the de4x5 modules of recent kernels,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;2.0.36 and 2.2.0-pre[5679] I have tried and works with my system, which 
</EM><BR>
has
<BR>
<EM>&gt;the onboard 21143 and a true DE435-AA PCI EtherWORKS card with a 21040
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;chip.  The AlphaBIOS, MILO and the kernel detects both properly.
