<P>
Hello,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not very happy right now.  My Alpha just machine checked again,
<BR>
and this is the third time in 4 weeks.  The first and third time are almost
<BR>
identical (shown below).  The second time was while I was away on vacation
<BR>
and I called my Apt. manager and asked her to reset my box (all my mail
<BR>
bounced and I was kicked from lists (including this one) during the
<BR>
downtime).  I have no logs for that machine check*.
<BR>
<P>Here are the two that I have:
<BR>
<P>APECS machine check:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;vector=0x670 la_ptr=0xfffffc0000006000
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;pc=0x200001ed8b8 size=0x2e8 procoffset=0x110 sysoffset 0x1a0
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;expected 0 DCSR 0xffffffff80280005 PEAR 0xffffffff80000000
<BR>
...bunch of numbers...
<BR>
<P>In the third check, the only difference is the program counter:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;pc=0x1200ac270
<BR>
<P>The hardware is an AlphaStation 200 4/233 I bought in May from onsale.  I
<BR>
have never seen this problem until recently.  However... the software is
<BR>
kernel 2.1.131 with my fix to keep PPP from panicking.
<BR>
<P>The machine checks seem to happen at interrupt time; in the case of the
<BR>
third one, on a keystroke composing an email.  This is a major problem for
<BR>
me.  If anyone can help, I would be ever grateful!  If moving to another
<BR>
kernel will help, I'm game.
<BR>
<P>* Now, one gripe about this machine check business:  I see that all the
<BR>
output from the machine check is coming from printk() within the kernel.
<BR>
So we must have some limited ability to continue executing instructions
<BR>
after my favorite mishap.  Why then do we allow the machine to simply halt?
<BR>
At least, that's what happens to mine.  The disks are not synched, the
<BR>
machine check printk()'s never make it to syslog and the box doesn't
<BR>
reboot.  Is is possible for precautions to be taken to safely recover from
<BR>
this event?
<BR>
<P>thanks,
<BR>
-bp
