<P>
<EM>&gt;&gt; However, I have a problem and a half. My full problem is that I cannot make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; it work and retrieve an IP through DHCP.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Really, a file Documentation/Changes is a **required** reading material
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you want to play with 2.2.x kernels.  It states, among other things,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;You will need to upgrade your dhcpcd / dhcpclient&quot; followed by other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; details.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have the new kernel 2.2.0 up and running for a day now. I solved the
<BR>
relatively lower sound volume by cranking the volume of my system sounds via
<BR>
KDE Sound Mixer and it works properly, actually it even sounds better, but
<BR>
the sound board on the AS 200 is kindda crappy, anyway. Thus far, the only
<BR>
application that does work properly is KMail, but I hope that the new
<BR>
version of KMail (KDE 1.1) will fix it.
<BR>
<P>My **literacy** efforts paid off (kindda, they got me into different types
<BR>
of troubles with DHCP, but that is a different story...) and my machine now
<BR>
retrieves an IP from the DHCP server. However, I have now different types of
<BR>
problems that don't seem to affect the overall operations, but which I would
<BR>
like to correct. One of the problems is that I am getting unaligned traps
<BR>
again (I had this problem while I was running the stock Red Hat 5.1). The
<BR>
other problem is that, even though my machine retrieves the IP, it displays
<BR>
the following line:
<BR>
<P>+ echo DHCP configured but ifup timed out
<BR>
<P>What is the meaning of it?
<BR>
<P>Moreover, how can one record *all* of the boot-time prompts to a file? I
<BR>
read my Running Linux book, but it only talks about logging specific types
<BR>
of prompts.
<BR>
TIA. Cordially,
<BR>
ZP
<BR>
