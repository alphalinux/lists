Hi There!
<BR>
<P>Sorrythat I am posting this message on three mailing lists, but I think
<BR>
my question has something to do with all three topics.
<BR>
<P>I got a preinstalled AlphaPC164UX Computer two days ago and it seemed to
<BR>
work fine, it still is. But I tried to install some new rpm packages and
<BR>
I somehow got error messages from the computer.
<BR>
<P>First I tried to use &quot;glint&quot; to manage the packages and I could see all
<BR>
of the installed ones in there without any problems. I then tried to
<BR>
install another package, but it didn't want to work. The installation
<BR>
window somehow hang up and the only thing I cold do was to press the x
<BR>
in the upper right hand corner. Funny enough the package later on
<BR>
appeared in the glint window after restarting glint. But I realised that
<BR>
much later.
<BR>
<P>Then I tried to install the KDE Desktop and I did it with rpm. It worked
<BR>
fine and it didn't gave me any error messages. I then tried to execute
<BR>
it but somehow while starting up the X window with startx it just
<BR>
stopped and gave me an error message. I then tried to uninstall the
<BR>
whole thing, but the only thing the computer told me was that the
<BR>
packages are not installed. But I could see them in the directory
<BR>
structure that they definitvely are installed. I also opened up glint
<BR>
and there I could see them as well. As a test I tried to install or
<BR>
update them. But then the Computer told me that they are installed. As
<BR>
the next command I tried 'rpm -e kde...' but then he responded that this
<BR>
package is not installed, which seems to be strange to me. I have some
<BR>
questions because of this now:
<BR>
<P>1. Is there any error know to rpm for the Alpha System similar to the
<BR>
one I get? (I am using version rpm2.5.5-5.2 and glint2.6.2-1)
<BR>
<P>2. Is the problem with the X Window because of the KDE I am using? with
<BR>
FVWM2 it seems to work, but only when I move the mouse it is starting.
<BR>
<P>3. Is there any other way I can install KDE or/and enlightnment on this
<BR>
system?
<BR>
<P>The system is a AlphaPC164UX board with a 533MHz Alpha 21164 Chip, three
<BR>
SCSI Hard Drives and an ATI Graphics Board Mach64 with 4MB Video RAM,
<BR>
The RAM is 128MB and 2MB of Cache.
<BR>
<P>Answeres to the list or in private to (<A HREF="mailto:gademana@tcd.ie?subject=Re:%20Problems%20with%20using%20RPM%20on%20an%20Alpha%20533">gademana@tcd.ie</A>) will be very
<BR>
welcome.
<BR>
<P>Thanks very much in advance
