Hi Jim;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought I'd get back to you now that the dust storm from your post has
<BR>
settled a bit (but be expecting some of the spawned conversations / debates to
<BR>
rage on for a while.).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle lines between the Intels &amp; the Alphas is nearly as much fun
<BR>
as any other.. :)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw lots of interesting answers out there, but none that really
<BR>
answered your question. (which is pretty normal for this list. ).  So... 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First off, Alphas are deffinately not for everybody. They do have a
<BR>
niche, but not as your sole box. The bottom line is: The software just ain't
<BR>
out there for it yet. If you're after a primary workstation, stick with an
<BR>
Intel. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do have an Alpha, and I use it every day. What for? It's my firewall
<BR>
/ mail hub / etc... It does all the nasty background tasks that used to burn
<BR>
clock cycles on my Intel box, thus freeing up the Intel for real work (3D stuff
<BR>
mostly...). Beyond that, I find my Alpha to be wayy to slow for any practicle
<BR>
use (I have an AlphaStation 200 4/233 ).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only reason I keep it, is that it does what I have it doing very
<BR>
well, and it was dirt cheap. This frees up the rest of my systems for fun
<BR>
stuff....
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway... Good luck with it. If I were you, I would strongly consider
<BR>
off-loading it, and picking up a good Intel. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ric

<EM>&gt;First, don't flame me for this email, as I'm not really trying to sell my alpha through this post... I'm mostly venting.  I think I got into the alpha world without doing enough research.  I prevailed through an install of an AS200 with 32MB, CDROM, and a 2GB hard drive.  Got my redhat 5.2 installed, X working, etc, etc, only to find out that I have an extremely reliable system for which there are no decent browsers available (IHMO) and no Frontpage extensions, and seems half of the apps I want to run aren't ported to alpha yet.  I'm not a heavy duty coder, so I'm unlikely to do my own porting any time soon.

<EM>&gt;To make a long story short, I'd like to know what you folks out there who are HAPPY with your Alphas do with them.  I'll probably sell mine to that sector, and buy myself an Intel.
