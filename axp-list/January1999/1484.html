<EM>&gt; On a good note, the DP264 (dual 21264) will be released Monday, the LX

<P>I've only just saved all my hard earned pennies and got myself a UX4
<BR>
based workstation (I assume the UX4 is a 'ruffian', I'm very new to
<BR>
all the terminology). Currently it only has NT4, but I intend (when
<BR>
I've worked out what the heck MILO/ARCBIOS/other-stuff is) to install
<BR>
RedHat as my primary operating system.
<BR>
Am I scuppered? 
<BR>
I thought the UX was the latest greatest 164 system - in which case
<BR>
how come it's dead already?
<BR>
I'm no alpha/linux wiz, is there a simple RH CD set I can literally
<BR>
install with one command (I'm not lazy, just dumb) and which will then
<BR>
work without me having to mother it? I can get access to the RH5.2
<BR>
all-processor CD set, but have been warned that &quot;it comes with almost
<BR>
no instructions&quot;, and it's a 2.0.36(?) kernel which I now read is old
<BR>
hat. Or shall I just use NT for the rest of its life (no, you can't
<BR>
wish that on anyone). 
<BR>
Cheers,

<P>P.S. I rarely have access to anything more high tech than e-mail, so
<BR>
'downloading the latest patches' is a non-trivial operation.
