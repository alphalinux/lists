<EM>&gt; Was it those, who found it dangerous to speculate about conditions 30

<P>This was quite a bit earlier than 30 years ago and this was often a
<BR>
concious decision.  A computer memory was then awfully expensive (do you
<BR>
know what &quot;core&quot; really means?)  and these two digits meant real money.
<BR>
I've read some analysis which claimed that that would be bigger money
<BR>
that what it costs today to fix the problem.  I do not know if this is
<BR>
really true but it may be.  One could ask, of course, why not to use
<BR>
more effective year representation, as 8-bits may mean 128 years back and
<BR>
127 forward, but decoding this representation was also an extra memory -
<BR>
this time for programs.
<BR>
<P>What is more baffling that the stuff a few years old, like some variants
<BR>
of BIOS for Intel boxes, shows this problem.  Original designers did
<BR>
not take into account a huge inertia - mostly in programmer managers. :-)
