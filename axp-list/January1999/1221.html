Hi!
<BR>
<P>A little more on this problem.  I have tried a different mouse and
<BR>
keyboard.  I still can not logon to the console.  I can reboot the
<BR>
machine via telnet and gain access back to the keyboard from milo.
<BR>
I have tried the original stock kernel that 5.2 installed.  Still no
<BR>
joy.
<BR>
<P>Could this be a module problem?  I deleted the old modules when I
<BR>
recompiled the kernel.
<BR>
<P>I also recently upgraded the AlphaBios to the latest version. (5.64, I
<BR>
think)
<BR>
<P>Does anyone have a suggestion on what to try next?  I can not think what
<BR>
the problem might be.  The keyboard is totally dead (even the CAPS lock
<BR>
key won't light).  GPM complains about /dev/mouse being busy and errors
<BR>
out.
<BR>
<P>I am at a loss.
<BR>
<P>Thanks
<BR>

<P>-- Original post --
<BR>
<P>I recently installed RedHat 5.2 on my Miata.  I had some problems with
<BR>
the X Probe crashing the installation but I eventually got through it.
<BR>
<P>I now have to recompile the kernel for SCSI DAT Tape support.  I
<BR>
recompiled and rebooted the node.  Now I can not log into the console.
<BR>
The node is up and running as I can get into it via Telnet.  The video
<BR>
subsystem is working because I can issue an /sbin/init 5 to get the X
<BR>
login screen (Can't type or move mouse).
<BR>
<P>Any suggestions?  It is a stock Redhat 5.2 system running on a Miata
<BR>
<P>Thanks
<BR>
