<EM>&gt; *maybe* Samsung. Definately not AMD.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, I know, AMD doesn't have the resources.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; AMD just licensed the ev6 bus for their processors and chipsets,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no other parts of the archatecture.
</EM><BR>
<P>But, in addition, I thought Alpha had to find another licensee before
<BR>
Intel finallly about them out a few years back and AMD was it?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Plus, they're moving to remove that bus and just go with an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; HT (HyperTransport) connect coming straight out of their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CPUs.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I know.  But what are they doing inside?  I wouldn't be surprised
<BR>
if the new, integrated memory controller (let alone the cache
<BR>
controller) is very much based on recent EV designs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; They're also desperately trying to dump their chipset biz to the 3rd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; party vendors to save costs.
</EM><BR>
<P>And HyperTransport is an _excellent_ means of doing this.  AMD, great
<BR>
job!  They really hit Intel blindside with this approach.  SiS and
<BR>
nVidia already have their technology in use in their chipsets.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Samsung is still doing *some* stuff with Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, I'm still curious.  You'd figure that they'd still be able to use
<BR>
the existing cores and shrink to new feature sizes -- but I know its a
<BR>
_lot_ more complicated than that.  Too bad Intel just didn't buy out
<BR>
Alpha back in the mid-'90s.  I mean, thanx to Digital's FX!32 (and the
<BR>
corresponding one for Linux), Intel could have probably gotten better
<BR>
x32 compatibility and performance out of binary translation, combined
<BR>
with the Alpha's performance thanx to its simplicity.
<BR>
<P>God I loved Alpha.  It was RISC to an &quot;anal-level,&quot; just right IMHO.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Most of the UP* series was designed @ API (who has dumped Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; entirely now).
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep.  Hopefully API Networks will become the &quot;premier&quot; engineering
<BR>
component for HyperTransport.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The only exceptions are the UP1100 (phasing out if not already phased
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out), and the UP1500. The UP1500 may never see a huge light of day
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because it uses an AMD761 chipset. Unless they can swap it to a Via or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; another 3rd party vendor's chipset that emulates the true AMD chipset,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they're out of luck. At the very least if they do this, it means a major
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; re-spin of the board which will take some time and may not be justified
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; w/ the shortening life of Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<P>You'd figure they could make a HyperTransport version and then API
<BR>
Networks could come out with an HT memory controller bridge?  I guess
<BR>
I'm thinking too far &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; on what Samsung can do.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; With CPQ shooting itself in the foot w/ marketing and trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get the bullet out w/ a pair of pliers instead of seeing a real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doctor, it may just all be water under the bridge at this point.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah.  Again, I think we'll miss Alpha.
