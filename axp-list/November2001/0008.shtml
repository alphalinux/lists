<EM>&gt; Please try 2.4.13, there are patches in there for PC164 that appear to

Wow,
<BR>
you some kind of fairy, or what? OK, I gotta admit that the sound doesn't 
<BR>
come as it should, but perhaps this is due to the fact that it has to share 
<BR>
the bandwith (10MBs) together with a copy over an NFS-partition. So the mp3's 
<BR>
don't come as fast as they should.
<BR>
&nbsp;But besides from that, it seems to run OK. Let's say, I'll try it during the 
<BR>
next week, and if it doesn't crash, I'd say someone did a REALLY good job! 
<BR>
&nbsp;[30mins later] OK, the CD is burned (over NFS), the scanner got his picture 
<BR>
and the sound is still playing (also NFS). Never got this done all in the 
<BR>
same time. I hope it keeps going!
<BR>
&nbsp;Thank you very much for the good tip. I gave up on 2.4.12 :( One too early!
<BR>
