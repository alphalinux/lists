Hi,
<BR>
<P>I'm still confused as to whether RH7.2 for Alpha and further releases will
<BR>
be produced. As I understand it RH has asked Compaq for a sum of money (I
<BR>
beleive $1million) to guarantee further releases. Does anyone think it would
<BR>
be a good idea to send a letter to someone within Compaq asking them to
<BR>
support further development of RH for Alpha? Does anyone - Jay? - know who
<BR>
would be a suitable person to approach concerning such a request?
