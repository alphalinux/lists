<EM>&gt; I dunno, I kinda miss my Trash-80 now and then... but then again, a buddy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of my father's hooked an Armatron(yeah, remember those? ) up to his so he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could control it from the TRS-80. I think I still have a Model IV and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a CoCo if anybody wants to pay for shipping. :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, if it's time to brag about mixing old and new (for now)
<BR>
hardware, here's my bid:  I have a CoCo 3 that runs my lawn
<BR>
sprinklers during the summer.  I have an Amiga 1000 and 500
<BR>
connected to an Alpha machine, using the Amigas as serial
<BR>
terminals (text only).  If I get the time, the Alpha will take
<BR>
over for the CoCo for next summer--but I said that last year,
<BR>
too.
<BR>
<P>CoCo's, Amiga's, and Alpha's: Oh, my!  :-)
