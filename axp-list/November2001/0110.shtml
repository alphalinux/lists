*maybe* Samsung. Definately not AMD.
<BR>
<P>AMD just licensed the ev6 bus for their processors and chipsets, no other
<BR>
parts of the archatecture. Plus, they're moving to remove that bus and
<BR>
just go with an HT (HyperTransport) connect coming straight out of their
<BR>
CPUs. They're also desperately trying to dump their chipset biz to the 3rd
<BR>
party vendors to save costs.
<BR>
<P>Samsung is still doing *some* stuff with Alpha. Most of the UP* series was
<BR>
designed @ API (who has dumped Alpha entirely now). The only exceptions
<BR>
are the UP1100 (phasing out if not already phased out), and the UP1500.
<BR>
The UP1500 may never see a huge light of day because it uses an AMD761
<BR>
chipset. Unless they can swap it to a Via or another 3rd party vendor's
<BR>
chipset that emulates the true AMD chipset, they're out of luck. At the
<BR>
very least if they do this, it means a major re-spin of the board which
<BR>
will take some time and may not be justified w/ the shortening life of
<BR>
Alpha.
<BR>
<P>With CPQ shooting itself in the foot w/ marketing and trying to get the
<BR>
bullet out w/ a pair of pliers instead of seeing a real doctor, it may
<BR>
just all be water under the bridge at this point.
