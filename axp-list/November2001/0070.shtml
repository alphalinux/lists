<P>
What type of database load test are you running? Is it a freeware type test
<BR>
or one that you wrote. I would like to test some machines with a database
<BR>
and was looking for some type of benchmark tool to use, but haven't found
<BR>
one yet.

Subject: Re: AS 4100 install problem
<BR>
<P><P><P>Hi All
<BR>
<P>Thanks once again for all the invaluable tips in getting
<BR>
my 4100 working.
<BR>
<P>As it turned out I had alpha bios version 5.21 installed
<BR>
on the machine, once I had upgraded the firmware it
<BR>
all booted up just fine and is now being well and hammered
<BR>
with a database load test, and all is looking good.
<BR>
<P>One interesting this is that I happen to have 2 of these
<BR>
little beasties and the other one has not been upgraded
<BR>
yet so I might have ago woth the serial console and post
<BR>
the panic message to the archive, incase anybody else
<BR>
has this problem.
<BR>
<P>On a side issue the two boxes used to be installed
<BR>
together in a rather nifty looking raid setup.
<BR>
<P>In all I have 33 disks (mostly taking up all the room
<BR>
in my basement) and each 4100 has two of everything.
<BR>
<P>However it has a pretty fancy looking scsi adapter with a
<BR>
label saying &quot;A09-KZPSAPS&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Is this board supported under linux by any chance ? I've
<BR>
search about a bit but to no avail.
<BR>
<P>Off to play with my new machine !
<BR>
