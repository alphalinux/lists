<P>Netscape rpms are somewhat &quot;special&quot; in that sense that Netscape is
<BR>
not really a Linux application and therefore does not actually depend
<BR>
on any libraries outside of those which are in Tru64-compat package.
<BR>
Therefore any of those rpms will work on any RH distribution on Alpha
<BR>
including 5.x (this I know from practice :-) and likely earlier if
<BR>
they are still around.
<BR>
<P>The only differences are minor location changes (like /usr/share/doc
<BR>
vs. /usr/doc) and you can provide a link or two.

<EM>&gt; 2. Downloadable RPM's for RH 6.2 does not work on RH 6.2
</EM><BR>
<P>There was a number of updates of 'rpm' itself in the meantime and
<BR>
in particular rpm-3.0.5-9.5 (I hope that I remember the version right
<BR>
but it was the last last one in 3.0.5 series) still maintains an old
<BR>
format of a database and accepts both version 3 and version 4 rpm
<BR>
headers.  Wonder of wonders it will still unpack the latest rpms on
<BR>
an old 5.2 based system.  Those who wanted to use up2date service
<BR>
would have to switch to rpm-4... and probably because new rpms need
<BR>
to be compatible with up2date they show up in this format.
<BR>
<P>Besides it is really quite trival to cut an rpm header and feed the
<BR>
remainder into gunzip or bunzip2 and pipe that to cpio if you really
<BR>
do not have anything else handy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What do you do? Crap Linux and go back to Wintel?
</EM><BR>
<P>That would be somewhat interesting to watch on Alpha. :-)  I would
<BR>
recommend XP for that.
