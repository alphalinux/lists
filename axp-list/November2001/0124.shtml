<P>Yes, you can.  Linux does not care.  You do _not need_ that partition

with Linux but if it is there there is no harm done (well, you have only
<BR>
seven partitions left for other purposes).  I have many disks in actual
<BR>
use to show it.  You may _want_ that partition if the same disk will be
<BR>
ever accessed by something else.

<P>Note that 'c' partition you from the original message was of a type

&quot;unused&quot; so the above does not apply.

<P>A version of 'fdisk' as supplied by Red Hat has a nasty habit of dumping
<BR>
a core if there are traces of an old &quot;FAT style&quot; partition table on a
<BR>
disk and you attempt to write a new &quot;BSD-like&quot; one.  This was reported
<BR>
quite a few times both to Red Hat and utils-linux maintainer, and
<BR>
reports included proposed patches, but apparently without results (I did
<BR>
not check for that problem the latest version utils-linux).  Maybe there
<BR>
are also some other troubles of that sort with &quot;leftovers&quot;?  If this is
<BR>
indeed the case you should be able to work around by overwriting first
<BR>
two, say, sectors with nulls ('dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda count=2' or
<BR>
something like that) and writing a new disk label on a &quot;clean slate&quot;.  I
<BR>
never had troubles with any variant of 'fdisk' after such sweeping.
<BR>
<P>If you are trying to fix an existing labelling make careful notes about
<BR>
partition boundaries.  You likely want to restore them and not to
<BR>
reinstall everything from scratch. :-)
