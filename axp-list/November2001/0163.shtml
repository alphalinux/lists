On Thu, Dec 06, 2001 at 08:35:12PM -0600, G.L. Grobe came forth with:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; ... and it went all the way through and didn't throw any exceptions near the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; end w/ anaconda. So now I'm back up and running and getting ready to rebuild
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the kernel (w/ NIC support) so that I can get it on my LAN.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
hmm.. if you're using the built in card, either the de4x5 or the tulip
<BR>
driver should get it working (sometimes one is unhappy, and you need to use
<BR>
the other depending on the chip rev).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; #1. Is there anything different about building/installing a new kernel for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the alpha's that would be any different from an intel box. Is 2.4.x stable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough for this box?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
if it compiles, yes. (A lot of the 2.4 series don't compile straight off).
<BR>
<P>don't make bzImage though, make vmlinux (or vmlinuz). Then you add the
<BR>
kernel to /etc/aboot.conf
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; #2. Where'd alphalinux.org goto?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
up and down. linuxalpha seems to be more reliable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; #3. What's the difference between 500a and 500au? The front of the box says
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 500a, and 500au is on the console screen. Originally I thought they were 2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different boxes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
They were sold as NT or Unix machines. The NT ones had hardware that doesn't
<BR>
work with VMS/Tru64. I think the NT ones were cheaper as well (but don't
<BR>
quote me on that).
<BR>
<P>L.
