<EM>&gt; Hi,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm still confused as to whether RH7.2 for Alpha and further releases will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be produced. As I understand it RH has asked Compaq for a sum of money (I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beleive $1million) to guarantee further releases. Does anyone think it would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be a good idea to send a letter to someone within Compaq asking them to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support further development of RH for Alpha? Does anyone - Jay? - know who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be a suitable person to approach concerning such a request?
</EM><BR>
<P>I am not sure that it matters. I have a feeling that Compaq may not be
<BR>
surviving for much longer in there currnet incarnation.
<BR>
<P>It might be better to work in getting Intel to provide support for the
<BR>
alpha.
