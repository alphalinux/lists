<P>
With regards to your message at 01:27 PM 11/15/01, Bryan-TheBS-Smith. Where 
<BR>
you stated:

<EM>&gt; &gt; *maybe* Samsung. Definately not AMD.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yeah, I know, AMD doesn't have the resources.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; AMD just licensed the ev6 bus for their processors and chipsets,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; no other parts of the archatecture.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But, in addition, I thought Alpha had to find another licensee before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Intel finallly about them out a few years back and AMD was it?
</EM><BR>
I know that the licensees published were:
<BR>
Samsung
<BR>
Mitsubishi ( made a lot of or all of the PC164SX boards)
<BR>
IBM (fab CPUs for Compaq now)
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; Samsung is still doing *some* stuff with Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yeah, I'm still curious.  You'd figure that they'd still be able to use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the existing cores and shrink to new feature sizes -- but I know its a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;_lot_ more complicated than that.  Too bad Intel just didn't buy out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Alpha back in the mid-'90s.  I mean, thanx to Digital's FX!32 (and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;corresponding one for Linux), Intel could have probably gotten better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;x32 compatibility and performance out of binary translation, combined
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with the Alpha's performance thanx to its simplicity.
</EM><BR>
<P>The simple fact is that you need more than a CPU. You need a chipset too.
<BR>
This is where the &quot;wheels fell off&quot;
<BR>
Compaq did not invest in new chipsets for one and 2 CPU designs, only the 
<BR>
&quot;big iron&quot; stuff, like Wildfire. The DP264, DS20, UP2000 et al all use a 
<BR>
chipset Digital designed and started making in 1997.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;God I loved Alpha.  It was RISC to an &quot;anal-level,&quot; just right IMHO.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Most of the UP* series was designed @ API (who has dumped Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; entirely now).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yep.  Hopefully API Networks will become the &quot;premier&quot; engineering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;component for HyperTransport.
</EM><BR>
<P>Right, just like they &quot;carried the ball&quot; with Alpha. They seem to be mostly 
<BR>
a company of opportunity, not innovation.
<BR>
What is left of them now I understand you can count on one hand, and I 
<BR>
believe those are all management, not engineering.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The only exceptions are the UP1100 (phasing out if not already phased
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; out), and the UP1500. The UP1500 may never see a huge light of day
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; because it uses an AMD761 chipset. Unless they can swap it to a Via or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; another 3rd party vendor's chipset that emulates the true AMD chipset,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; they're out of luck. At the very least if they do this, it means a major
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; re-spin of the board which will take some time and may not be justified
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; w/ the shortening life of Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You'd figure they could make a HyperTransport version and then API
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Networks could come out with an HT memory controller bridge?  I guess
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm thinking too far &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; on what Samsung can do.
</EM><BR>
<P>Samsung can figure out ways to stay alive with their semiconductor division 
<BR>
losing tons of money, just like all the rest of the chip makers.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; With CPQ shooting itself in the foot w/ marketing and trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; get the bullet out w/ a pair of pliers instead of seeing a real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; doctor, it may just all be water under the bridge at this point.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yeah.  Again, I think we'll miss Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I am sure we will, just like we missed MIPS, Atari, Amiga, and lots of others.
<BR>
