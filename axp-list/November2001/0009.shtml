<P>
Just getting in from a day on the road..so there may already be a number of
<BR>
comments regarding who's systems and architecture have been driving Intels'
<BR>
fab processes.
<BR>
<P>This really isn't news. Intel has been one of DEC/Compaqs reference
<BR>
accounts for many...many years. The hardware along with VMS Clustering is a
<BR>
nearly bullet-proof combination, so it's a perfect combination for
<BR>
environments that require 99.999% uptime. Seems to me (don't quote me..it's
<BR>
been many years) that when I first hired on with DEC in 1986, Intel,
<BR>
Honeywell, HP and others relied on VMS and the VAX line for their HR, MRP
<BR>
(though not referred to as MRP at that time) and other critical applications.
<BR>

<EM>&gt;More interesting stuff from the people at theinquirer.net.  The article at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;<A HREF="http://www.theinquirer.net/01110105.htm">http://www.theinquirer.net/01110105.htm</A> explains how Intel has been useing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;VAX systems to run software that makes sure their own processors don't suck.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The funniest quote is &quot;That process is now finished, but unfortunately by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the terms of the agreement, Compaq is unable to shout out to the world that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the Alpha chip is so good that it's even used to make Pentium 4s and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Merceds.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Nothing earth shattering just a slightly funny read for those of us that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enjoy irony.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As far as any legal action on recent Compaq announcements that I suggested
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;recently, I did talk to a lawyer from a large law firm.  It is her opinion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that the only legal action against Compaq would be breach of contract
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;between Compaq and it's suppliers or customers.  (i.e. If you don't have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;contract with Q then there doesn't appear to be a case for you)  This of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;course is contingent on the contract and what is in it what provisions etc..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As far as announcements about Alpha living on and other recent press
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;releases that in retrospect seem to be bald face lies? I am told that as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;long as these annoucements are made in &quot;Good faith&quot; and proving bad faith is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;extremely difficult, there is little legal action one can take there are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exceptions but none seem to be relevant (as far as I could see). FYI
