<EM>&gt; &gt; I sent a message to this list a couple of days ago asking if there is

<EM>&gt; &gt; see if I'm really posting..

<EM>&gt; If that's the MYLEX RAID controller, then, yes, there is a driver, BUT...

If he is indeed talking about the KZPSA adapter (the wide differential one
<BR>
with an Intel i960 chip on it - full length), no, it's not the MYLEX RAID
<BR>
controller.  It's a strange DEC contraption (IIRC), and when I mentioned
<BR>
opening the specs for someone to write an Open Source driver to a person
<BR>
that lived through getting the adapter working on Tru64, his eyes didn't
<BR>
just roll back - I think they made a couple of loops around.
<BR>
<P>Apparently it has some rather nasty gotchas that made debug a real bear,
<BR>
and didn't exactly make anyone want to work on it once it was working.  I
<BR>
can check again inside about making the specs available (I believe it's an
<BR>
EOL adapter, so that _shouldn't_ be too far-fetched), but first someone
<BR>
who actually _wants_ to write a driver for this adapter and has the skills
<BR>
to would have to step forward.  Anyone up for this kind of pain? :)
