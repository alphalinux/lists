As &quot;Aaron Gee&quot; &lt;speedracer@italian-cars.com&gt; pointed out in his note I just
<BR>
deleted about &quot;irony&quot;....
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.theinquirer.net/01110105.htm">http://www.theinquirer.net/01110105.htm</A> 
<BR>
<P>Most of the 24x7x365 Industrial and Financial heart and soul of America runs
<BR>
on Alpha either as VMS or Tru64 (and to a certain extent on Tandem, but
<BR>
they aren't Alphas). Aside from a 390 there is nothing out there that
<BR>
matches them for either performance or reliability -- never has been.
<BR>
<P>Two plus years ago, Project Bravo ported Tru64 Unix to Merced -- using the
<BR>
IA64 emulator running on top of an EV5/6 machine running Tru64 version 4.
<BR>
(Might have been an EV6, not certain.) The project was abandoned largely
<BR>
because Tru64 ran faster on that emulator than it ran on the IA64 Silicon
<BR>
when it was finally received from Intel. [And the fact that the Enterprise 
<BR>
division (Tru64 and VMS)  was not allowed to compete with the Industry
<BR>
Standard Server Division... even though the reverse prohibition was (and
<BR>
is) not true.]
<BR>
<P>Back in those days -- nominally 1999 -- Today's shipping and soon to be
<BR>
shipping Alphas (EV6/7 and EV7) were known to be much better performers
<BR>
than anything Intel had in its pipeline through 2004. McKinley was
<BR>
predicted to be as fast as an EV6/7 machine, but since it doesn't exist
<BR>
yet, so nobody yet knows if will be even close. [As for the Alpha
<BR>
acquisition, except for the initial press relase, Intel has failed to
<BR>
acknowledge the deal -- never even mentiond the deal/technology in the
<BR>
September Intel Developer's keynote.]
<BR>
<P>The sad thing is that the Alpha was killed for purely marketing reasons.
<BR>
$280 million R&amp;D is a big number when you are loosing your shirt. &quot;Inferior
<BR>
Technology&quot; had nothing to do with it, despite the spin that Q has tried to
<BR>
put on the decision. Compaq is a PC company, despite all their claims to
<BR>
the contrary. They simply were never able to market Alpha even though the
<BR>
technology was far superior to anything on the market. And as of
<BR>
SuperComputing 99, IBM had nothing that could compete with EV8 (or EV7 for
<BR>
that matter) ... which was supposed to be shipping now, not EV7! 
<BR>
EV7 was delayed more than a year because of &lt;pick your favorite
<BR>
non-technology-related reason&gt;. 
<BR>
<P>So yeah, Alpha was an expensive deal -- but that's because Compaq told the
<BR>
world that Alpha was a proprietary, non-standard environment... what else
<BR>
would any right thinking person conclude when confronted with a corporate
<BR>
division which sells &quot;Industry Standard Computers&quot; -- but doesn't sell
<BR>
Alphas?
<BR>
<P>Once again, Superior technology looses out because of inferior marketing.
<BR>
Superior marketing always wins, no matter how inferior the technology.
<BR>
<P>In the 1970s there was IBM and the BUNCH
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burroughs
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Univac
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCR
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CDC
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honeywell
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[By that time the RCA &quot;Octoputer&quot; had been consumed by Univac.]
<BR>
Then there was the &quot;Power of 2.&quot;
<BR>
Then Compaq bought DEC.
<BR>
And now there is HPQ.... oh well.
<BR>
=========
<BR>
...&quot;deja-vous&quot; all over again...?
<BR>
<P>9 months after RCA sold their &quot;money loosing&quot; computer division to Univac,
<BR>
their internal accountants &quot;adjusted&quot; their numbers and discovered that not 
<BR>
only was the computer division NOT loosing money, but had actually been 
<BR>
making money for the proceeding several periods....it was expenses from the
<BR>
rest of the company [read, marketing expenses], unjustifiably charged to the
<BR>
computing division which caused it to look as if were loosing money.
<BR>
<P>Rumor has it that the only thing keeping Q more-or-less afloat this year
<BR>
has been Alpha sales in the HPC (High Performance Computing) arena, mostly
<BR>
Tru64, but a sizeable percentage also Alpha Linux.
