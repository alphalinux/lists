<P>I don't understand what you mean by &quot;run 32bit code at native 64bit
<BR>
speeds&quot;.  Hammer does appear to be much more similar to its x86 heritage
<BR>
than Itanium; it's 64-bit ISA is a straightforward extension of the IA-32
<BR>
ISA, and from what I hear it won't be crippled when executing IA-32 code.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However will Hammer be able to run Itanium native 64 bit code? Itanium is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; EPIC processor and I don't know what Hammer is. Is Windows 64 code
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compatible across both processors? Seems a bit pointless for Hammer to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 64bit if it's only going to be running 32bit software.
</EM><BR>
<P>No.  Hammer and Itanium are completely different processors.  They will
<BR>
have nothing in common except for their IA-32 compatibility.
<BR>
<P>Hammer's 64-bit ISA is completely new, and in order to take advantage of
<BR>
it we will need support from operating systems, compilers, and commercial
<BR>
software.  AMD is working on these, or the first two at least.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The same goes for linux I know that Suse is developing a 64bit linux for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hammer will Itanium and Hammer 64bit linux code be compatible?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, the Linux kernel for Itanium is completely different than that for
<BR>
Hammer.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Also will 32bit x86 linux code run on Hammer or even Itanium?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, both should support x86 legacy code.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; After all Compaq Alpha NT code was only compatible with Alphas and x86 code
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had to be binary translated using FX32. Alpha NT native code wouldn't be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compatible with Hammer or Itanium.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep.  Everybody has their own 64-bit CPU now... Intel, AMD, Sun, IBM,
<BR>
Compaq, HP, SGI.  They are all different.  Perhaps the industry really
<BR>
will converge on IA-64 as they did for x86... then again, perhaps not.
