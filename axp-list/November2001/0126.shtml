<P>&quot;In response to rumors that IRIX developers and customers will be forced

to abandon IRIX/MIPS and adopt Linux/IA, Akeley said, 'We're not going to

force a transition on anyone, anywhere. We've made a commitment to MIPS

and IRIX. We've established roadmaps for both IRIX and MIPS that will keep

them vital and viable for a long, long time.'&quot;
