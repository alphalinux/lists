<P>
Thanks to all who responded this week and last. I started researching
<BR>
swriteboot but then a funny thing happened. I added the initrd param so my
<BR>
SRM line looked like this ...
<BR>
<P>boot dka0 -fi /kernels/generic.gz initrd=/images/ramdisk.img -fl
<BR>
&quot;root=/dev/hda expert text&quot;
<BR>
<P>... and it went all the way through and didn't throw any exceptions near the
<BR>
end w/ anaconda. So now I'm back up and running and getting ready to rebuild
<BR>
the kernel (w/ NIC support) so that I can get it on my LAN.
<BR>
<P>Before when I had a 2.2.13 (I think it was ... from 6.1) kernel running, I
<BR>
had so many problems (much like this time) that I just didn't trust building
<BR>
a new one for this PWS500a. I build'em all the time for intel boxes, but now
<BR>
with all this fresh in my mind, I'd like to put the latest on my alpha now.
<BR>
btw - I installed 6.2 because my local store had this really messed up RH
<BR>
box w/ an alpha 6.2 (the only alpha version they had) for like ... cheap.
<BR>
<P>So I have a few questions:
<BR>
<P>#1. Is there anything different about building/installing a new kernel for
<BR>
the alpha's that would be any different from an intel box. Is 2.4.x stable
<BR>
enough for this box?
<BR>
<P>#2. Where'd alphalinux.org goto?
<BR>
<P>#3. What's the difference between 500a and 500au? The front of the box says
<BR>
500a, and 500au is on the console screen. Originally I thought they were 2
<BR>
different boxes.
