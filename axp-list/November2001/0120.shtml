<EM>&gt; Not really wishing to continue this off-topic thread, I was just

<P>So I'll apologize to everyone else as well . . .
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...why does everyone continue to pretend SGI doesn't exist?  They still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a long roadmap for MIPS.
</EM><BR>
<P>But MIPS has always been a niche market.  It would be nice to see them 
<BR>
survive for awhile.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; (What ever happened to Transmeta/Carusoe? -- $2.60; down from a 52 week
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; high of $41.38)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IIRC they are having quality problems, and are facing strong competition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the low-power market, e.g. Intel's Mobile Celeron.
</EM><BR>
<P>I just purchased a Sony Picturebook with the Crusoe 667MHz.  I would take 
<BR>
this against anything from the Intel line for performance and battery life.  
<BR>
Well, actually for performance while on battery power and battery life.
<BR>
<P>The speedstep Intel processors never seem to mention that you lose 1/3 or 
<BR>
more of your performance running on batteries.  From my benchmarks I would 
<BR>
actually say 1/2.  And the power usage numbers for the &quot;ultra-low&quot; voltage 
<BR>
processors are on the 500MHz processors.  To me it is always the same, Intel 
<BR>
kicks ass on marketing.
<BR>
<P>I've heard for awhile now people mentioning the Crusoe's quality problems.  
<BR>
But, I have never heard what those problems are.  Is this about production 
<BR>
lines or how the processors perform?  As far as performance I've been very 
<BR>
happy with my laptop.  I'm running RedHat 7.2 and use it as a grade book, 
<BR>
video camera (using quicktime4linux), programming (fractals and stuff), and 
<BR>
as a tool to take from office to office while I'm fixing things.  One 
<BR>
&quot;strange&quot; feature is the increase in performance as you do the same thing 
<BR>
over and over.
<BR>
<P>I change a few lines of source code and then recompile several times a 
<BR>
session.  And the first run is usually twice the time of the last runs.  
<BR>
Which also means if I want to encode motion jpeg I need to first do a short 
<BR>
run at 15 frames a second before it will encode smoothly at 20 frames a 
<BR>
second.  If I really knew how to code I would the hardware mjpeg stuff from 
<BR>
the video driver into quicktime4linux.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Also I wouldn't rule out Intel's XScale, which is a capable contender in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the low-end of the market.
</EM><BR>
<P>I sure wish that Compaq would have had the brains to keep StrongARM.  It seem 
<BR>
to be the choice of new handhelds now.  It is amazing how far itzy has come 
<BR>
with the StrongARM Linux handhelds coming out.
