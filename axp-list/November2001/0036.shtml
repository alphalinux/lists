<EM>&gt; I think I can reproduce your problem:
</EM><BR>
<P>I would be _really_ surprised if that would be the case but I do
<BR>
not have a machine with milo to check.  Still ...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; When I have LABEL=/ in (stock RH7.1)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fstab, and boot from milo, df tells me /dev/sda2 is mounted as root, despite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; /dev/sdc3 (the correct one from the kernel param &quot;root=/dev/sdc3&quot;) is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually mounted (!!).
</EM><BR>
<P>Something like that will really happpen if in that fstab
<BR>
you are using (you may have many if you have multiple installations
<BR>
on the same machine) you have a line which starts with
<BR>
<P>LABEL=/  / ....
<BR>
<P>Anaconda indeed puts &quot;/&quot; as a label on a root partition while installing
<BR>
and if you have multiple partitions with the same label the one which
<BR>
will be scanned first &quot;wins&quot;.  OTOH nothing says that a label on a root
<BR>
partition _has_ to be &quot;/&quot;.  You may put there &quot;MyOwnRoot&quot;, or whatever
<BR>
else you want and make labels unique, or you may mount by UUID (see 'man
<BR>
mount' and 'man tune2fs' for adding/replacing labels).
<BR>
<P>If fstab is messed up what gets really mounted and what gets _reported_
<BR>
are often not the same thing.  I have seen that on numerous occasions
<BR>
when disks got new positions due to hardware changes but /etc/fstab
<BR>
was not adjusted yet.  On the first &quot;single&quot; boot one has to be really
<BR>
careful to write where you think you are writing.
