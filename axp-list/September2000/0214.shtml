<EM>&gt;   &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; &gt; I am at a loss as to where a figure of $10-15K comes in for an Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; &gt; based workstation. If I remember right the good fellows up north
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; &gt; (maurice at harddata) had a XP1100 board and 667 (?) cpu for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; &gt; $2295. That would leave you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; &gt; $1700 for disk drives, memory, etc to hit the $4000 mark.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Those are dual CPU boxes. Look at their cluster prices. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   A 10 processor cluster is $49,995, $5k per CPU.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
This is the classic old Digital pre-MIPS pricing problem.... 
<BR>
<P>The CPU boxes (and memory) list prices are priced so high that they (the
<BR>
VARS) can give 50% discounts and still make a 20 or 30% profit.
<BR>
<P>With the MIPS boxes, Digital priced things as commodities, and got slammed
<BR>
in (especially) the education market by SUN because SUN still offered 50%
<BR>
discounts, and Digital only offered 10%. It didn't matter that the net
<BR>
price of a Digital MIPS box was less than the Sun... they faculty were
<BR>
pissed that they didn't get their 50% discount.
<BR>
<P>So Alphas goosed the price back up again.
<BR>
<P>Now somebody like Microway comes along, offers a price that is 20% less
<BR>
than Compaq, and it looks like a good deal.
<BR>
<P>In memory, we saw the same thing - Clearpoint was 20% cheaper than Digital,
<BR>
but kingston was 60% cheaper... ie &quot;street prices&quot; for memory. (Of course
<BR>
then we went back to boards instead of simms.... )
<BR>
<P>My XP1000/667 listed at $17444 back in November of 1999. Our VAR knocked
<BR>
$7,000 off the price. So for $10K I got a 21264A / 256meg / 9gig x 10Krpm 
<BR>
SCSI / 10-100 ethernet / Powerstorm 350 graphics /600 CDrom and a Tru64
<BR>
license.
<BR>
<P>I would assume that any reasonable third-party vendor could offer an
<BR>
equivalent system for half that - $5,000 - if they wanted to.
<BR>
The only thing &quot;extra&quot; you need to buy is a monitor.
