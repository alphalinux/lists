<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; We did some recent testing here, between a 1 GHz Athlon &quot;Thunderbird&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; box and a 500 MHz 21264.  The Athlon had 256 KB of full-speed L2 to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 4 MB of 2/5-speed L2 cache on the Alpha; on the other hand the Athlon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; had PC100 memory (theoretical bandwidth 800 MB/s) as opposed to our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Alpha's 2656 MB/s theoretical memory bandwidth.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; PC133 would have made for a better comparison. Hopwever if you used a board
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the AMD chipset you would have problems.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I'd like to have tested a PC133 (1064 MB/s) box; in fact, we have one
<BR>
on order but it hasn't arrived yet.  Still, the code in question (and the
<BR>
codes we use that Alpha for) are typically memory intensive, and I expect
<BR>
would still run faster on our Alpha.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Athlon motherboards with PC2600 (DDR 166) memory should close the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bandwidth gap, but those won't be available for a while yet.  In the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; meantime, we're very happy with our 21264, and we've been able to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; real work on it for quite some time.  :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are several DDR boards that will ship in October. One board maker was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; claiming September (iWill).
</EM><BR>
<P>Hopefully yes.  My understanding is that those will be PC2100 (DDR 133)
<BR>
boards with the PC2600 boards showing up next year, but even so that'd
<BR>
be a *big* improvement.  And yes, hopefully the Alpha manufacturers will
<BR>
also be able to take advantage of this technology.  As someone (Wes?)
<BR>
pointed out, the Alpha we're using gets 2656 MB/s per channel by having
<BR>
4-way interleaved memory running at 83 MHz.  If the board could take
<BR>
PC2600 memory instead, the theoretical bandwidth works out to 10624 MB/s!
<BR>
<P>And, we're not waiting for those boards.  We've had our current Alpha
<BR>
server for something like a year, and done good work on it.
<BR>
<P>This isn't to harsh on the Athlon; the motherboard we tested it on is
<BR>
not as capable, frankly, and that's going to have an impact on how
<BR>
well the processor can shine.  After all, we're certainly finding ways
<BR>
and places to put Athlons to work, as well as Alphas.  :)
