Ok here's how to do it (it's not as easy on Linux as it is on solaris / DU)
<BR>
<P>first off, if you're running RHat 6.2 you need an updated autofs rpm
<BR>
(the one I have here is autofs-4.0.0-pre7-11) because the one that came with
<BR>
6.2 for alpha doesn't work
<BR>
<P>set the config file /etc/auto.master to have a line like this:
<BR>
<P>/home yp:auto.home
<BR>
<P>(/home is the directory you want to automount to, then the yp:auto.master is
<BR>
the config file that's exported via NIS)
<BR>
<P>next you need to start the svc (this one is obvious but I'll mention it
<BR>
anyways)
<BR>
<P>see if that's any better. I had it running at one point and I broke it
<BR>
somehow (I know not what I did... but again this is RH7 beta 3 that I'm
<BR>
running, so anything could have caused it)
<BR>
<P><P>lemmie know how you make out

Subject: Automounting and NIS [OT]
<BR>
<P><P>OK, sorry it's a bit off-topic but in my defense a) the client is a Digital
<BR>
PWS and b) I got no response from the redhat-list crew...
<BR>
<P>Can anyone tell me how to get exported home directories to automount on my
<BR>
PWS?  We have an NIS server that has the maps for our user accounts and
<BR>
their home directories, and it works for all the irix, tru64 and solaris
<BR>
workstations we have but not for this a-linux one.  portmap, autofs and the
<BR>
automount daemon are all running, and NIS is working to the extent that I
<BR>
can get in with my user account but my home directory isn't mounting.  I've
<BR>
been working on this for nearly a week now and I'm starting to feel really
<BR>
stupid.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
