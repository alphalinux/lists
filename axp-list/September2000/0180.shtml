<P>BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! ROTFLMAO!!!!!!!
<BR>
<P>Using a seti client that was written specifically for Intels SSE
<BR>
instructions? HAHAHAHA!!!!!!! Sorry but this issue has been beat to
<BR>
death in the Athlon/Intel forums and this is total bullshit.
<BR>
<P>And what performance tools are you supposedly using here? All the well
<BR>
known name tests show quite clearly that the Athlon outperforms the
<BR>
PIII/P4 in virtually every instance. No doubt you are using tests that
<BR>
are based solely on SSE perfomance, an old trick really, but one that is
<BR>
all to easy to see through.
<BR>
<P>You got it backwards, Intel has a long way to go to catch up with the
<BR>
quality of the Athlon. Just FYI, the athlon design team includes former
<BR>
Alpha design team members.
<BR>
<P>What are you comparing against? the original 500mhz Athlon? The current
<BR>
Athlons (Thunderbird) walk all over the benchmarks for the PIII and P4
<BR>
in virtually EVERY category. Even ZDNews posted a story about the P4
<BR>
performance being mediocre compared to comparable speed Athlons.
<BR>
<P>Heh heh, I though you were trying to be serious here.
