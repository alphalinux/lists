<P>&quot;Blue Sky purchased the new computer equipment for use on
<BR>
&quot;Ice Age&quot;, its first computer-animated feature film with
<BR>
parent company 20th Century Fox Animation.&quot;
<BR>
<P><P>I wonder how that will be affected by the fact that their parent company Fox
<BR>
Animation closed it's doors recently.
<BR>

</EM><BR>
<P>A total of 4 apps. Not exactly a strong endorsement of a well supported product.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Alpha does hollywood:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<P>A single reference with no details. Also to Blue Sky, as in the first reference. So
<BR>
far, the implication seems that Blue Sky was the only reference Compaq could come
<BR>
up with for studios still using the Alpha platform.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Rendering software:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www6.compaq.com/alphaserver/products/hollywood/rendering_software.html">http://www6.compaq.com/alphaserver/products/hollywood/rendering_software.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<P>Mostly a rehash of one of the previous links provided. Mental Ray, Renderman,
<BR>
Houdini and yet again, Blue Sky is mentioned. This time for their proprietary in
<BR>
house software. Presumably not available otherwise.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Compositing software:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www6.compaq.com/alphaserver/products/hollywood/compositing_software.html">http://www6.compaq.com/alphaserver/products/hollywood/compositing_software.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; While these don't specifially address Linux and lower end of film/video
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; production efforts, they do point out Alpha is very much a player in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; digital production world.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yet another rehash of one of the previous links provided. This time listing only 2
<BR>
of the 4 software titles mentioned in the first link.
<BR>
<P>What would appear to be a plethora of links proving that the Alpha is still a
<BR>
strong contender is quickly dismissed when one reads the material presented. These
<BR>
links do little more than repeat the same material over and over. They certainly do
<BR>
not give much credibility to the Alpha does Hollywood Impression that is being
<BR>
presented.
<BR>
<P>Honestly I could find more Amiga links that would make it appear as if Amigas and
<BR>
Video Toasters were still strong contenders in the content creation arena that was
<BR>
provided here for Alpha.
<BR>
<P>To be quite blunt, I would be embarassed to present this list of links as any kind
<BR>
of evidence. They are far too weak, easily dismissed and pitifully lacking in
<BR>
content.
<BR>
<P>As clarification though, those apps listed are all quite exceptional products. All
<BR>
well worth their respective costs.
