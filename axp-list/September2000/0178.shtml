<EM>&gt; &gt; True, it does come down to economics.

<EM>&gt; &gt; However, I doubt crowds of Linux fans chipped in and paid for a Maya port. AW claims that reason was

<EM>&gt; &gt; customer demand.

<EM>&gt; Of course, any company will say that. ;)  It sounds much better to say &quot;we listened to our customers&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than &quot;we took a big bribe&quot;.  It may be true, but I suppose it's possible that neither the briber nor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the bribee want anyone to know... *shrug*

<P>Actually more likely that it has to do with SGI's new Linux strategy. They took such a beating in the NT
<BR>
market that they are desperate to distance themselves from that fiasco.
