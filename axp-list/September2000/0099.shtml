<EM>&gt; &gt; unfortunately the Athlon is shipping in 1.1 ghz. and AMD is releasing no

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ranging in speeds from 1.5ghz. up to 2 ghz.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yup, and it's still slower (at some things, _much_ slower) than the Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even at a given clock speed.  Tell me again why Alpha has higher SPECCPU
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scores at 500MHz than Athlon at 1GHz?  And has anyone noticed where the extra
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 32 bits on the Athlon chip went?  Oh, that's right - it's only a 32 bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chip!  Doh!  So much for my VLM capabilities without needing massive hacks...
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep.  Anyone around here who doesn't yet know the virtues of the Alpha
<BR>
hasn't been paying much attention.  64-bit, plenty of registers and a
<BR>
clean ISA.  I personally enjoy coding for it.
<BR>
<P>I think the game for many is really price/performance, not MHz.  Athlons
<BR>
might not have better absolute performance than Alpha, but they are dirt
<BR>
cheap.  I bought my SX three years ago because it didn't cost as much as
<BR>
2-3 x86 workstations.  It wasn't the fastest, but it was measurably
<BR>
faster than x86 at the time, and it was easy to justify as a development
<BR>
workstation.
<BR>
<P>I've been patiently waiting for EV6 to hit the same price point, but I
<BR>
don't see it happening.  They are still well outside the hobbyist budget
<BR>
and more than what most companies are willing to pay for desktops.  It
<BR>
isn't clear to me whether Athlon succeeds due to volume alone, or if AMD
<BR>
uses other tricks to cut costs relative to API.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; It may be considered a return of bragging rights, but it is a hollow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; vicotry at best.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Okay, if this is a hollow victory, I guess I'll take it.  That, and the best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; damned chip money can buy.  Oh, and I'll see you at EV7.  And if you're not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an Alpha user and that doesn't scare you, it's only because you don't get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it.  But if you seriously believe your email, that's a good indication that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you don't get it anyway...  Go out, read the product briefs and check the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; benchmark scores.  Then join the believers.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think Steve and others have read the product briefs and seen the
<BR>
scores.  No doubt many are frustrated that the particular application
<BR>
they need isn't available on Alpha or doesn't perform adequately on
<BR>
Alpha because commercial software vendors haven't spent the time and
<BR>
money to optimize their apps on Alpha.  Commercial vendors may also not
<BR>
be willing to ship products tuned specifically for EV6 with such a large
<BR>
base of EV56 and earlier out there.
<BR>
<P>The difference with Athlon is they can beat Intel with the same codes. 
<BR>
Nobody writes code specifically for Athlon either, but it doesn't matter
<BR>
much.  (It'll be _very_ interesting to see what kind of industry support
<BR>
AMD can muster for their 64-bit Sledgehammer.)
