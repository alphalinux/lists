Hi,
<BR>
<P>We have a few DeskStation Ruffian (RXP164-2) systems.  They have been used
<BR>
for &quot;production&quot; runs very reliably, so we haven't had any reasons so far
<BR>
to upgrade any of them from their 2.0.30 kernels.
<BR>
<P>Recently, one of them died from a (system) disk crash.  I've purchased an
<BR>
identical replacement HD.  But we're facing the question what best to do
<BR>
with this system, and so I'd like to poll people on their experiences and
<BR>
recommendations whether they'd:
<BR>
<P>1. Rebuild it the way it was, i.e. &quot;clone&quot; it back from one of the other
<BR>
systems, to run with the 2.0.30 kernel again?  (Any recommendations as
<BR>
to what would be the best/quickest way to do this?)
<BR>
<P>2. Use the opportunity to upgrade the system to a newer/newest version of
<BR>
Linux?  Any tips as to what people would recommend, and how best/fastest
<BR>
to do this?
<BR>
<P>3. Try to put Tru64 on it?  We have one of those $99 Tru64 licenses.  
<BR>
(From what I've heard/read, I don't think that's possible with
<BR>
this system, but you can always ask...)
<BR>
<P>Hardware: 
<BR>
RXP164-2 MoBo;
<BR>
onboard Symbios 53C875 UW SCSI Controller;
<BR>
onboard Digital 21143 10/100 Ethernet Controller;
<BR>
Diamond Stealth64 Video 3000 Series (S3?) video adapter (we use the system
<BR>
exclusively for numerical apps, so video performance is not an issue; we
<BR>
have video in the system just for bootup).
<BR>
Firmware: ARCS BIOS 1.3.058
<BR>
<P>Since the Tru64 part of my question is OT, you can e-mail me privately on
<BR>
this topic if you want to.
<BR>
<P>TIA,
<BR>
<P>Marc
