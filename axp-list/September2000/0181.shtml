<P><EM>&gt; Sure it does. Athlons should perform better than they do.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; At least a 500Mhz 21264 Alpha, capable of 1GFLOP can get pretty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dang close to that. Athlons are saddled with bad motherboard/
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memory designs. Same goes for PIII.
</EM><BR>
<P>Athlon boards are based on EV6.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; Lack of software is the problem. What are you talking about?

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Let me refresh your memory:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Just FYI here, on the entry level 21264, a single frame render of Lightwave is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around 300 seconds, vs. the older &quot;Classic&quot; Athlon 1ghz. also taking about 300
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seconds for the same scene. &quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Please note that I said Classic Athlon. That has 512k off die cache, running at less than
<BR>
full cpu speed. The same test on the latest Thunderbird processors at 900 mhz. comes out
<BR>
to around 250-260 seconds.  A full 40-60 seconds faster than the 21264/500.
<BR>
<P>A system with a  21264/500  would cost what? and would it run NT4? at the least I suspect
<BR>
around a 1k or more than  the Athlon, and is going to complete a single frame one minute
<BR>
slower than the 32bit Athlon. for 24 FPS, that time increases  to 24 minutes for one
<BR>
second of animation, and even more considering that a sequence might be 2, 3, 5 or more
<BR>
minutes long.
<BR>
<P>Of course I could go to dual 600's which would reduce the time to like 150-160 This woud
<BR>
be real good, but at what cost then? If I use Microway as an example, I could buy a 10
<BR>
unit renderfarm of Athlons for about the same price. So I would still get better
<BR>
performance and better cost out of Athlon.
<BR>
<P>The only thing that is going to set the balance right is if the Alpha gets priced
<BR>
reasonably. Otherwise it is a system for those who have no interest in cost.
