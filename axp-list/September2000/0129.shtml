<P>
If your team is purchasing DS10 or DS10L's for $7K, even at the 617MHz
<BR>
rate, you should consider some one on one time with them...and simply let
<BR>
them know, it's not Alpha you can't afford....it's them.
<BR>
<P>The whole notion of the gross expense of Alpha has gone to far. Fact of the
<BR>
matter is, the newer 10's and 10L's can be had within the $4K range. I
<BR>
realize at least one purpose served through this group is to push the
<BR>
price/performance numbers. I just don't believe much progress will ever be
<BR>
made in this area through the use of inflated references.
<BR>
<P>Bottom line...software developers port to large numbers of boxes first.
<BR>
Others port to support the needs of high margin/must have environments. I'm
<BR>
not sure Alpha will ever have the huge numbers to boast of that x86 can. On
<BR>
the other hand, todays reality is that Compaq can't build the new 617MHz
<BR>
systems fast enough to avid paying penalties for late delivery. Given the
<BR>
number of partners now building the Alpha chip....I'd call this encouraging.
<BR>

<EM>&gt;&gt; So here are the real questions:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  - Is having 3D rendering programs on Alpha (let's say Alpha Linux for
</EM><BR>
now) desirable
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; by you?  (Wider audience -  how many would pay for them, and at which
</EM><BR>
premium - the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; one for Windows or UNIX?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Fortunately, a number of mainstream programs are going Linux. Houdini was
</EM><BR>
released
<BR>
<EM>&gt;already for Linux, Maya is being released soon etc. Fortunately, this
</EM><BR>
brief flirtation
<BR>
<EM>&gt;with M$ NT crap is rapidly coming to an end.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Certainly from a technical point the Alpha is preferable. Of course there
</EM><BR>
are some
<BR>
<EM>&gt;financial considerations as well. When the Alpha was 7,000.00 box and was
</EM><BR>
WAY out ahead
<BR>
<EM>&gt;of 4,000.00 PC box, it was one thing. However, when you can build very
</EM><BR>
fast and very
<BR>
<EM>&gt;powerful systems for dirt cheap and the Alpha is pushing 10-15 grand for a
</EM><BR>
box, the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;chioce gets much harder.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  - What price point would you need a DS10 (DS10L now, I guess) to meet
</EM><BR>
in order to be
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; more cost effective for your work than the Athlons currently available?
</EM><BR>
For example:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; say the Alpha is 2x as fast as the latest Athlon which costs $2k for a
</EM><BR>
full system,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; so the Alpha should cost no more than $4k.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I find that completely logical. It is also a point I could sell to
</EM><BR>
management. But when I
<BR>
<EM>&gt;tell them the Alpha is 2x as fast and cost 10k as opposed to 2k for the
</EM><BR>
Athlon, they will
<BR>
<EM>&gt;tell me to go buy 5 Athlons. My average completion time is faster, and
</EM><BR>
therefore, this is
<BR>
<EM>&gt;a better buy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; If I can get some sort of a consensus I'll take whatever I get to Compaq
</EM><BR>
management
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; and lobby for support (what form it takes to be decided).  If Alpha is
</EM><BR>
as dead or
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; dying in the rendering business as you say it is, maybe this will be its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; resurrection.  Whatever else I may be, I will do my damnedest to get
</EM><BR>
this done if
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; people really want it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Last year at Siggraph, StationX Studios shared the booth with API, they
</EM><BR>
were showing the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;prerelease version of their animation software called Messiah. (runs on
</EM><BR>
Alpha and x86) I
<BR>
<EM>&gt;had voiced concerns over Alpha at the time and asked if both versions came
</EM><BR>
on the same
<BR>
<EM>&gt;disc as many other apps did. I was told it did not, but was recommended
</EM><BR>
that I get the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Intel version if I had doubts since &quot;people were dumping Alphas left and
</EM><BR>
right&quot; At the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;time I doubted this, but since the Athlons have come out, numerous
</EM><BR>
Lightwave effects
<BR>
<EM>&gt;houses have ditched most or all of their Alpha equipment. We dumped 20
</EM><BR>
systems, and I
<BR>
<EM>&gt;have helped others that were also transitioning to Athlon and selling
</EM><BR>
Alpha equipment.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;From numerous reliable sources and associates, Alphas are getting dumped
</EM><BR>
faster than
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Amigas were.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However, price may not be the only deciding factor in Alpha getting back
</EM><BR>
into the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;production market. Newtek holds a 51% marketshare in studios and
</EM><BR>
production houses, with
<BR>
<EM>&gt;SoftImage, Maya and others splitting up the balance. Only a couple of
</EM><BR>
these have
<BR>
<EM>&gt;announced Linux solutions, and even less Alpha Linux.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;IF Newtek could be persuaded to port Lightwave 6.x to Alpha Linux, that
</EM><BR>
would be
<BR>
<EM>&gt;something. But Linux still has a long way to go in the way of support.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I despised having to sell my Alpha systems, but when it got to the point
</EM><BR>
that I could not
<BR>
<EM>&gt;use the latest tools, they became a hinderance that did nothing more than
</EM><BR>
take up space.
