<EM>&gt; &gt; unfortunately the Athlon is shipping in 1.1 ghz. and AMD is releasing no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; less than 5 new iterations of the Athlon processor over the next 5 months,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ranging in speeds from 1.5ghz. up to 2 ghz.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yup, and it's still slower (at some things, _much_ slower) than the Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even at a given clock speed.  Tell me again why Alpha has higher SPECCPU
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scores at 500MHz than Athlon at 1GHz?  And has anyone noticed where the extra
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 32 bits on the Athlon chip went?  Oh, that's right - it's only a 32 bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chip!  Doh!  So much for my VLM capabilities without needing massive hacks...
</EM><BR>
<P>And this has any relevance when the software market that I once depended on has
<BR>
vanished? Of course for the 12 grand I woudl spend on a single Alpha system, I
<BR>
can buy a complete renderfarm of Athlon systems at 1ghz  each to do the work I
<BR>
need, and I will do it much fast than I would have with the single Alpha. So in
<BR>
effect, the Alpha is not even remotely cost effective at all in this matter.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; Intel stock was just downgraded, and Athlon processors are rapidly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; replacing Alphas on a widespread basis in the production environment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Um, and what production environment are you talking about?  Or is this an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; omnipotent statement meant to speak of a greater truth?  Hrmpf...maybe our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sales figures are wrong, because it looks like Alpha is stronger than ever.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hey - did someone accidentally lump Athlon sales under the &quot;A is for Alpha&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; category?  Didn't think so.  Face it - everyone is replacing everyone; Sun is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; replacing Alpha, Alpha is replacing Sun; IBM is replacing Intel, Intel is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; replacing IBM.  And, to top it all off, there's this great new company called
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha Processor Inc. that is dedicated to the Alpha and the low- and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mid-range customer base.  So...if our Alpha sales are doing so well, _and_
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there is a company outside that is also selling them independently...hmmm...
</EM><BR>
<P>Apparently you have little knowledge or contact with the 3D animation market. IF
<BR>
you did, my comment would have been quite easy for you to understand. For sake of
<BR>
clarification, production environment was used to represent the word studio. As
<BR>
in production studio. This is a place where modelers, animators and other
<BR>
creative types work producing television shows, commercials and motion pictures.
<BR>
<P>These types of places used the Alpha fairly heavily at one point in time, where I
<BR>
work included. While you may not want to hear it, the simple fact is that in this
<BR>
environment, Alpha is getting dumped real fast by just about everyone. As it was,
<BR>
there was not a lot of Alpha support there to start with. SoftImage, Lightwave,
<BR>
Digital Fusion etc. A fairly small but impressive list of vendors.
<BR>
<P>In the last couple of months I have personally offered assistance to studios who
<BR>
are migrating away from the Alpha platform due to lack of continued software
<BR>
support.
<BR>
<P>While Alpha may be stronger than ever, it is only in the server/database/number
<BR>
crunching arena. Where 3D Animation is concerned, Alpha has all but left the
<BR>
building. There are some rumblings from a few vendors about Alpha Linux support,
<BR>
but this seems to be more rumor than reality.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Oh, and as for Intel.  When was the last Alpha chip shipped that had to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pulled en-masse because of a hardware bug that couldn't be worked around.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The word &quot;marginal&quot; just means &quot;we didn't find the bug in our one-person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; testing lab so it can't be that bad&quot;.  And of course, ahem...wanna compare
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; errata sheets?  I'll rent the forklift so you can bring in the errata for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IA32 chips.  Frankly, pathetic - truly pathetic.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yawn.......
<BR>
<P>I think you might want to try pulling the stick out pal. I was not the one who
<BR>
started the Bragging rights return crap. All things considered, it is pretty
<BR>
amusing to say the least that someone felt that mhz. was so important to get all
<BR>
gung ho over.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; It may be considered a return of bragging rights, but it is a hollow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; vicotry at best.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Okay, if this is a hollow victory, I guess I'll take it.  That, and the best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; damned chip money can buy.  Oh, and I'll see you at EV7.  And if you're not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an Alpha user and that doesn't scare you, it's only because you don't get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it.  But if you seriously believe your email, that's a good indication that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you don't get it anyway...  Go out, read the product briefs and check the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; benchmark scores.  Then join the believers.
</EM><BR>
<P>I was an Alpha user. Maybe if you learned to read instead of just being an ass,
<BR>
you would have gotten it. I know what the Alpha can do. unfortunately in reality
<BR>
it just doesn't cut the grade for the industry I am in.
<BR>
<P>Yeah, I believe my own e-mail, unlike you, I know what I am talking about.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;  - Pete (who's in a really cranky mood...)
</EM><BR>
<P>That was pretty freakin obvious.
