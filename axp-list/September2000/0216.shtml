<P>
Too bad you know so little about it.  Possibly next you
<BR>
might also improve your vocabulary since it reveals
<BR>
quite a bit about your lack of imagination or rational
<BR>
argument.  Rather than rely on the work of others in
<BR>
news groups, the place of lowest signal to noise
<BR>
ratio in the universe, I made my own measurments.
<BR>
<P>The seti@home client for the alpha's is optimized code
<BR>
that is compiled using the the compaq ccc compiler.
<BR>
The comparison between athlon and pentium is done
<BR>
using the same client.   I am simply using the selfsame
<BR>
numbers published by the nongraphics clients.  The
<BR>
computations are computing number of ticks per flop.
<BR>
Because of the large amount of memory (the entire
<BR>
data set is stored in memory and is always being
<BR>
chirped and FFT'd), the L2 write through performance,
<BR>
interrupted frequently for disk writes, is put to the
<BR>
serious test.  The alpha whips both the athlon
<BR>
and the pentium in these comparisons but the pentium-ii
<BR>
beats the athlon .  The pentium-iii beats the both and
<BR>
the pentium-iii xeon is the big winner as should be expected.

<EM>&gt; &gt; This was revealed to me in one of the great tools for measuring

<EM>&gt; &gt; performance, seti@home, and the various performance measuring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; tools that people have kindly donated.  Since then I have run
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; other benchmarks and the results are all the same.  Athlon has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a ways to go to even compete with Pentium III's.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! ROTFLMAO!!!!!!!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Using a seti client that was written specifically for Intels SSE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;instructions? HAHAHAHA!!!!!!! Sorry but this issue has been beat to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;death in the Athlon/Intel forums and this is total bullshit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And what performance tools are you supposedly using here? All the well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;known name tests show quite clearly that the Athlon outperforms the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;PIII/P4 in virtually every instance. No doubt you are using tests that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are based solely on SSE perfomance, an old trick really, but one that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all to easy to see through.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You got it backwards, Intel has a long way to go to catch up with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;quality of the Athlon. Just FYI, the athlon design team includes former
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Alpha design team members.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What are you comparing against? the original 500mhz Athlon? The current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Athlons (Thunderbird) walk all over the benchmarks for the PIII and P4
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in virtually EVERY category. Even ZDNews posted a story about the P4
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;performance being mediocre compared to comparable speed Athlons.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Heh heh, I though you were trying to be serious here.
