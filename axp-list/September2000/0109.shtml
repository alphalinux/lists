Athlon systems.

<P><P><EM>&gt; The difference with Athlon is they can beat Intel with the same codes.

<EM>&gt; Nobody writes code specifically for Athlon either, but it doesn't matter

<P>Likely to be better than for Itanic, as programmers do not have to re-write their

code from the ground up like they will for the Intel processor.
