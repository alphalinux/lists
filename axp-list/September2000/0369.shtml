When I installed Gnome recently I had to remove all of the old Gnome
<BR>
packages first.  I had to actually go into /usr/share and delete by hand a
<BR>
couple of Gnome files that kept getting left behind even when I would
<BR>
remove them all using rpm.  My problem wasn't that Helix wouldn't start.
<BR>
My problem was that both gnome and helix code kept running together.  And
<BR>
they didn't like each other enough. (applets wouldn't all work, terminal
<BR>
windows would seg if you tried to use them. . .etc.).
<BR>
After I removed all of the gnome stuff and then installed the Helix
<BR>
packages in 3 series (1,2, &amp;3 not that this had any effect).   It seems to
<BR>
work fine now.

<EM>&gt; &gt; it wouldnt

<EM>&gt; Cool, I figured it was something silly like that, don't know why the helix

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Nope, that's not likely to be the problem as I have KDE 1.1.2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; installed. It doesn't work though... anyone know if the RPMS from alo are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; broken or not?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; How are they broken? have you changed your libstdc++?

<EM>&gt; whenever I try to run a program from the panel, the panel crashes, I
