<P>
I have a 900+ Mhz Athlon and 533 Mhz 21164A.  They are very
<BR>
comparable in speed, etc.  The 264 would simply wipe the floor
<BR>
with the Athlon.  The Athlon's performance vis a vis write-through
<BR>
L2 cache performance is anemic compared to even a Pentium II !
<BR>
They got it cheap alright, at  performance computing expense.
<BR>
This was revealed to me in one of the great tools for measuring
<BR>
performance, seti@home, and the various performance measuring
<BR>
tools that people have kindly donated.  Since then I have run
<BR>
other benchmarks and the results are all the same.  Athlon has
<BR>
a ways to go to even compete with Pentium III's.   You can forget
<BR>
it when it comes to two generations old Alpha's.  They still,
<BR>
Mhz for Mhz, outperform them all.   If the Alpha community
<BR>
wants developers to develop for the Alpha, then the price
<BR>
for developers has got to come down.  I got my EV56 on the
<BR>
most amazing insider deal and built my system for about $400.
<BR>
I don't expect to beat that deal any time soon.  I have a computer
<BR>
with 512 Alpha's in it at work, as well as 21264A workstations,
<BR>
but of course, all of that work is proprietary.
