<P><EM>&gt; Loki is/was willing to port QIII to Linux/Alpha for a reasonable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fee which we would have (and still will) paid. However, the problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is the glide drivers for Linux/Alpha don't quite work. Loki
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't do video card drivers.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe some resources within Q could be spared to work on video
<BR>
drivers for these cards? Something that has lanquished for so long
<BR>
only because there hasnt been a serious effort to get it done.
<BR>
It's not like it's imposible or anything. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; At one point there was some action on this list with people talking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about actually working on porting some the the glide drivers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Haven't heard much lately. In order to make it worthwhile,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd imagine we'd need the Voodoo II/III (is V different?) and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a one or two others, eg nVidia.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
That was Phil Ezolt and Niki Waibel did the Voodoo II &amp; Glide
<BR>
work. The code is in CVS at alphalinux.org. The voodoo 5
<BR>
uses a different version of glide and AFAIK does not work 
<BR>
on Alpha. Though you really don't 'need' glide with a voodoo 5
<BR>
since it can do straight OpenGL too. More important is getting
<BR>
the actual driver working. 
<BR>
<P>As for the voodoo 3 work has been done and 
<BR>
dri/drm is working. Can anyone else comfirm getting this working?

<P>The developers say the did this in a XP1000  (tsunami). I remember
<BR>
Dr. Dave Gilbert was playing with it when it first came up though
<BR>
I can't remember if he got it working on his LX or not.
