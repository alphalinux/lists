<P>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; You're not going to get an EV6 system for $500 unless someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; starts buying them at volumes like an x86. Sorry. Believe me,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; I wish we could sell them cheaper! I'd love nothing more than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; to see every Linux developer running on Alpha. I wish I could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; figure out how to get even 30% of them to run on Alpha!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Oh, I understand.  I think the treshold from workstation to server for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   us is around $2k.  For a little more we could buy Sun hardware or maybe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   some UP1100's.  I don't know if we are typical, but we like to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   developer workstations of a similar architecture as our servers, so we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   can develop/test/debug locally or remote with fewer surprises.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
This is a problem/issue that Digital/Compaq Alpha marketing, still, simply
<BR>
does not understand.  We in the education community have been arguing this
<BR>
for years and the result was the reluctant creation of the XP900. There
<BR>
were no plans for ANY alpha workstation class machine a couple of years ago
<BR>
-- and the one they agreed to build was going to run VMS only!
<BR>
<P>People who &quot;grow-up&quot; using Intel or Sun workstations simply never
<BR>
&quot;graduate&quot; to using Alphas. If for no other reason than Alpha Workstation
<BR>
choices barely exist, let alone come close to being competitive on a
<BR>
cost-per-seat basis... and as someone mentioned, forget about applications,
<BR>
they just aren't there. It hurts any kind of justification efforts
<BR>
tremedously. 
<BR>
<P>If you've ever heard MadDog's story about getting Linus an Alpha years
<BR>
ago, you'll understand that this is not a new problem, just an ongoing one.
