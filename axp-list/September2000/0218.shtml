<P><EM>&gt; We did some recent testing here, between a 1 GHz Athlon &quot;Thunderbird&quot;

<P>PC133 would have made for a better comparison. Hopwever if you used a board with
<BR>
the AMD chipset you would have problems.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; The code we ran *was* faster on the T-bird -- if the data fit into L2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cache.  However, if the data didn't fit into L2 cache, it was faster
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the Alpha.  (The Alpha box also has a couple of GB of RAM, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think you can arrange on current Athlon motherboards.  It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also capable of taking a second processor, which you can't do with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Athlons yet.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Athlon boards can hold up to 2 gb. ram. Most are less, but Abit can hold 2.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Athlon motherboards with PC2600 (DDR 166) memory should close the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bandwidth gap, but those won't be available for a while yet.  In the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; meantime, we're very happy with our 21264, and we've been able to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real work on it for quite some time.  :)
</EM><BR>
<P>There are several DDR boards that will ship in October. One board maker was
<BR>
claiming September (iWill).
