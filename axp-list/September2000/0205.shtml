<EM>&gt; &gt; The front side bus is but the memory is standard PC.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Take a look at streams performance between a 21264 Alpha and an Athlon.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Athlons are a factor of two or more slower. Even though several Alphas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; use PC memory, they still blow away PIII and Athlon in memory bandwidth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; because their chipset interleaves the DIMM's.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is pretty much a factor of 2, no more.
</EM><BR>
<P>Depends on which Alpha you're comparing against.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I can match speed with a 500mhz. 21264 no problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with a 900 mhz. Thunderbird, specifically using Lightwave. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats fine for your use. Many people don't use that application.
<BR>
Really, you should just go with Athlon because that's where your
<BR>
app is most cost effective.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; One point that will get the shit flamed out of me for saying, and did at one point,  is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lightwave was poorly optimized for the Alpha platform. (actually not at all). A lot of people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; told me I was full of shit for saying that, even though they were admittedly using VC4 as their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compiler. Also I noticed the difference in performance between the Intel and Alpha platforms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were much wider on renders in SoftImage than they were between platforms on Lightwave.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>This is still your vendor's problem. I don't think anyone
<BR>
on the list can fix it. Might get some of the Compaq guys
<BR>
to talk to your vendor but that's probably about it. I don't
<BR>
think the guys on this list have budgets to get vendors to
<BR>
port SW to Alphas. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Also, you can interleave the Dimms on the Athlon as well.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have an Epox EP-8KTA that supposedly does that but it doesn't
<BR>
seem to work better than the normal 2 way interleave(the D in DIMM).
<BR>
Maybe just the board but everyone uses the same chipsets. Could
<BR>
be I set it wrong too. I plan on messing with that some more this
<BR>
weekend.
<BR>
<P>Have you actually done that and it made a difference in performance?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Please note that I said Classic Athlon. That has 512k off die cache, running at less than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; full cpu speed. The same test on the latest Thunderbird processors at 900 mhz. comes out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to around 250-260 seconds.  A full 40-60 seconds faster than the 21264/500.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Exactly what I said. Your vendor is screwing you in terms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of Alpha performance. I have 900 Mhz t-birds and they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are no match for my Alphas on all codes I run. Note that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is ALL codes. In no instance are Athlons faster than my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 21264's.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You are still missing the point. You seem to think I am Alpha bashing or something which is far
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from accurate. 
</EM><BR>
<P>You're complaining about price/performance of Alphas on your
<BR>
apps. I'm pointing out that your app is only one piece of the
<BR>
market that buys Alphas. Implying we're all ignorant of price
<BR>
performance issues because you have a problem with your app is
<BR>
not useful because it is your &quot;problem&quot;, not necessarily anyone
<BR>
else's. I buy Alphas because on my applications, they are more
<BR>
cost effective than Intel or Athlon, or several other brands,
<BR>
including SUN/IBM/HP.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The cost factor alone keeps Alpha from being a viable solution, that and lack of software since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my only choices are Linux, Tru64 and VMS.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>So you're saying you miss having NT on Alphas? I don't understand
<BR>
your point. Since the Athlon is faster for you, why do you really
<BR>
care? Seems you've let your loyalty/interest in a HW platform get 
<BR>
in the way of a business decision.
