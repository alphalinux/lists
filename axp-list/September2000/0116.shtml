<P>Doesn't bother me a single bit. I don't make computers my religion, just my job.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; To clarify a point that nobody has made directly. Clock speed is not the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same as instructions per second. I have not looked at the Athlon so I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cannot comment on specifics and I have not looked a the insturction timing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the Intel products for a while but I think my general points still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will hold true.
</EM><BR>
<P>To simplify this, my point was that Alpha no longer had an edge in the production
<BR>
market. The exceedingly high cost of even the entry level machine compared to the
<BR>
cost of alternatives do not make good financial sense or practicality.
<BR>
<P>True the Alpha is faster, but if I can combine in a renderfarm 10 machines for the
<BR>
cost of a single Alpha, and the results are say 5 times faster than the single
<BR>
Alpha, then what is the point?
<BR>
<P>Just FYI here, on the entry level 21264, a single frame render of Lightwave is
<BR>
around 300 seconds, vs. the older &quot;Classic&quot; Athlon 1ghz. also taking about 300
<BR>
seconds for the same scene. This is how I derived 5x the speed since I can build
<BR>
approx. 10 machines for the cost of a single Alpha. However, since the newere
<BR>
systems do not run NT, I cannot really compare as there is no Linux version of
<BR>
Lightwave to test on the 667's and up.
<BR>
<P>regardless of how one wants to try to justify numbers, the bottom line is meeting
<BR>
a deadline. PERIOD. If 10 Athlons get the job done substantially faster than a
<BR>
single Athlon for the same price, the financial decision is pretty easy to make.
<BR>
Being good on paper is great but doesn't mean a lot in the real world.
<BR>
<P>I don't do databases, spreadsheets, servers etc. Major 3D app vendors don't show
<BR>
support for Alpha linux.
<BR>
<P>As for how this started, with someone claiming &quot;Bragging rights return&quot;
<BR>
well....... that was pretty silly now wasn't it? since the Alpha was already
<BR>
faster than the current x86 offerings, why make such a foolish statement?
