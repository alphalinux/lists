<P><EM>&gt; unfortunately the Athlon is shipping in 1.1 ghz. and AMD is releasing no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; less than 5 new iterations of the Athlon processor over the next 5 months,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ranging in speeds from 1.5ghz. up to 2 ghz.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup, and it's still slower (at some things, _much_ slower) than the Alpha
<BR>
even at a given clock speed.  Tell me again why Alpha has higher SPECCPU
<BR>
scores at 500MHz than Athlon at 1GHz?  And has anyone noticed where the extra
<BR>
32 bits on the Athlon chip went?  Oh, that's right - it's only a 32 bit
<BR>
chip!  Doh!  So much for my VLM capabilities without needing massive hacks...
<BR>
<P>C'mon, when EV6 first came out and didn't move immediately past 500MHz people
<BR>
were decreeing the end of the Alpha.  Then Intel and AMD announced 1GHz chips
<BR>
and we weren't yet past 667MHz.  But geez, the Alpha is still faster.  When
<BR>
the Alpha was screeming past the barely 200MHz Intel chips at around 500MHz
<BR>
the Intel folks said &quot;Hey, it ain't the clock speed, stupid&quot; in an attempt to
<BR>
diffuse their less than lackluster performance.  But now all you hear is
<BR>
&quot;Look, we've cracked the 1GHz barrier and we'll keep going&quot;.  You don't hear
<BR>
anything about the barely marginal improvements (sometimes as low as
<BR>
single-digit percentage improvements for much, much larger clock speed
<BR>
increases) that the continued speed bumps are worth.
<BR>
<P>What does all that mean?  It means that IA32 is, frankly, running out of
<BR>
gas.  It's more than just clock speed, it's more than just &quot;Hey, look at the
<BR>
new jazzy things we make you do just to use our chip!&quot; (cf. the Pentium 4
<BR>
requirements), it's more than just putting it on a cartridge instead of PGA.
<BR>
It's the whole ball of wax - that means clock speed, instruction set and
<BR>
general chip technology, bus bandwidth, cacheing subsystem (size, # of sets,
<BR>
algorithms, etc.), memory topology, technology, bandwidth, and tools to make
<BR>
it sizzle.  Alpha has all of those (maybe slightly less so in clock speed
<BR>
_today_), and it has them in spades.  Intel, AMD?  Well, they've got clock
<BR>
speed and even some okay compilers.  But the rest of it?  Feh, give me my old
<BR>
Commodore64.  At least _it_ had excuses...  (Registers, Intel don't need no
<BR>
stinking registers...*blam*)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Intel stock was just downgraded, and Athlon processors are rapidly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; replacing Alphas on a widespread basis in the production environment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Um, and what production environment are you talking about?  Or is this an
<BR>
omnipotent statement meant to speak of a greater truth?  Hrmpf...maybe our
<BR>
sales figures are wrong, because it looks like Alpha is stronger than ever.
<BR>
Hey - did someone accidentally lump Athlon sales under the &quot;A is for Alpha&quot;
<BR>
category?  Didn't think so.  Face it - everyone is replacing everyone; Sun is
<BR>
replacing Alpha, Alpha is replacing Sun; IBM is replacing Intel, Intel is
<BR>
replacing IBM.  And, to top it all off, there's this great new company called
<BR>
Alpha Processor Inc. that is dedicated to the Alpha and the low- and
<BR>
mid-range customer base.  So...if our Alpha sales are doing so well, _and_
<BR>
there is a company outside that is also selling them independently...hmmm...
<BR>
<P>Oh, and as for Intel.  When was the last Alpha chip shipped that had to be
<BR>
pulled en-masse because of a hardware bug that couldn't be worked around.
<BR>
The word &quot;marginal&quot; just means &quot;we didn't find the bug in our one-person
<BR>
testing lab so it can't be that bad&quot;.  And of course, ahem...wanna compare
<BR>
errata sheets?  I'll rent the forklift so you can bring in the errata for
<BR>
IA32 chips.  Frankly, pathetic - truly pathetic.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It may be considered a return of bragging rights, but it is a hollow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vicotry at best.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, if this is a hollow victory, I guess I'll take it.  That, and the best
<BR>
damned chip money can buy.  Oh, and I'll see you at EV7.  And if you're not
<BR>
an Alpha user and that doesn't scare you, it's only because you don't get
<BR>
it.  But if you seriously believe your email, that's a good indication that
<BR>
you don't get it anyway...  Go out, read the product briefs and check the
<BR>
benchmark scores.  Then join the believers.
