<P>
I'm seeking suggestions to solve problems I'm having putting a
<BR>
SCSI CDROM drive on a UP2000 running Redhat 6.1, 2.2.13-0.9
<BR>
kernel.
<BR>
<P>I have a Yamaha CRW8424S CD writer that has worked flawlessly for
<BR>
months connected to a NCR/Symbios 53c875 PCI card, on the
<BR>
internal 50-pin connector.  (I have an HP 6300 scanner on the
<BR>
card's external 68-pin connector, through an adapter cable.)
<BR>
<P>About a week ago, I tried adding a low-end Toshiba CDROM drive to
<BR>
the same chain as the Yamaha drive.  I could mount and see some
<BR>
data from both drives.  However, when I tried to read a serious
<BR>
amount of data from the Toshiba drive, it would spin down and
<BR>
report &quot;drive not ready, make sure there's a disc in the drive&quot;
<BR>
errors after a nondeterministic amount of data, usually 1-4MB.
<BR>
<P>So, I bought a (more expensive) Kenwood UCR-416-RB drive at
<BR>
Fry's.  Now, the &quot;mount&quot; command for either drive hangs, or I get
<BR>
messages that /dev/cdrom (symlink to /dev/scd1) has wrong major
<BR>
or minor number.  Both CD drives are seen by SRM,
<BR>
/proc/scsi/scsi, and /etc/sysconfig/hwconf apparently okay.  I
<BR>
have the termination jumpers correct, and I have tried
<BR>
configurations with either drive at the end of the chain.  I even
<BR>
tried using 68-50-pin adapters and using the built-in SE
<BR>
connector on the UP2000, with basically the same symptoms.
<BR>
<P>One other thing, &quot;lsmod&quot; says sr_mod is uninitialized, even after
<BR>
I did some random gyration to get the Yamaha drive to mount with
<BR>
the Kenwood on the chain.  This strikes me as odd.
<BR>
<P>Does anyone have experience with the Kenwood drive?  Is the drive
<BR>
just antisocial?
<BR>
<P>Does the uninitialized sr_mod mean the driver has problems?
<BR>
<P>Any other suggestions?  (Next, I think I will try putting one
<BR>
drive on the Symbios controller and the other on the built-in
<BR>
Adaptec one.)
<BR>
<P>If the Kenwood doesn't work out, any suggestions for a vendor for
<BR>
a Plextor drive?  (I hear they are good.)
<BR>
<P>Thanks.
