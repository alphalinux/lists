<P>
<EM>   &gt; Intel stock was just downgraded, and Athlon processors are rapidly
</EM><BR>
<EM>   &gt; replacing Alphas on a widespread basis in the production environment.
</EM><BR>
<P>Intel's stock was downgraded because Intel had to recall yet another
<BR>
Processor last week. Their production numbers and projected revenues are in
<BR>
shambels as a  result. (Initial estimates were 2-4 months of re-design to
<BR>
fix the problem!) 
<BR>
<P>[SUN's Enterprise Servers have had a similar problem, but with the
<BR>
motherboards, for at least 6 months, but SUN had forced their customers to
<BR>
sign non-disclosures to get their boxes fixed so the story just started 
<BR>
to leak out last week.]  
<BR>
<P>Intel is really hurting right now on the high end and AMD has moved
<BR>
dramatically past them in the 32 bit world. And in the 64 bit world, the
<BR>
IA64 is still a joke. 
<BR>
<P>Itanium performance on real silicon is slower than Itanium emulation on
<BR>
Alpha EV 5!!! [Don't even think about how much faster the emulation is
<BR>
on EV6/7 compared to EV5.]
<BR>
<P>And the last I saw last week -- that sucker still draws 40 Watts!!!
<BR>
You'll never see that in a laptop or anything that is not kept in a
<BR>
seriously controlled environment. And we're not even close to a gigherz
<BR>
in clock speed yet.
<BR>
<P>The real problem is that Intel has the PR and Marketing machine whereas
<BR>
Compaq/Alpha (let alone Tru64) simply does not. DEC couldn't market its way
<BR>
out of a paper bag (&quot;stealth&quot; marketing was the term), and so far, Compaq
<BR>
has not proven any better for either Alpha or Tru64. VMS, by comparison,
<BR>
IS staging a strong comeback and THEY may pick-up the Alpha torch as a
<BR>
result. 
<BR>
<P>The recent stunning sales in the HPC world are despite the general
<BR>
marketing efforts, not because of them. Wildfire can run rings around
<BR>
anything else in the marketplace and the HPC technical people and the
<BR>
&quot;spooks&quot; know that - that's why they are buying them like candy. 
<BR>
But the General Public still believes that a 32 bit Intel box is &quot;as good
<BR>
as it gets.&quot; 
<BR>
