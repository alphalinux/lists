<P>
This could be one of those 'truly interesting' (ya can't get there
<BR>
from here) problems.  I just looked in my DU (very old -- 4.0-no letter)
<BR>
box.  In /usr/shlib, there's two more libs that care about yp:
<BR>
libaccmgr.so and libsecurity.so.  You could add them, but I don't
<BR>
think that would help.  I seriously doubt that they would know to call
<BR>
the linux ypbind to get info back from the yp server.  In fact, the
<BR>
libc.so and libc_r.so also seem to have some knowledge of yp, but the
<BR>
same problem is likely to exist there.
<BR>
<P>DISCLAIMER:
<BR>
There are many here sharper on this stuff than I.  If I'm full of
<BR>
crap (on this ;-), please speak up!

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have checked all the settings which you suggested. But still it's not
