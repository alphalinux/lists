<EM>&gt; &gt;...Hrmpf...maybe our

<EM>&gt; &gt;sales figures are wrong, because it looks like Alpha is stronger than ever.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Uh, stronger as in more pungent spin doctoring? ;-)

<EM>&gt; (The Deer Island sewage outflow pipes in Boston Harbor come on line today)

<EM>&gt; Or are Alpha volumes actually up?

<EM>&gt; P.S. I'm quite serious about the last question.

<P>I really wish I could tell you.  Even if I did have exact numbers, that's not
<BR>
something that I'd be allowed to share I'm sure.  But when one looks at the
<BR>
major bids that Compaq is winning with the Alpha (CEA, DOE, Acxiom, Ericcson
<BR>
and others) and combine that with the fact that there are a ton of customers
<BR>
with bids that maybe don't make the papers, as well as the fact that API is
<BR>
still around (which means that their sales performance can't be _that_ bad, and
<BR>
may even in fact be downright good) one is left to believe that sales should be
<BR>
at least fairly brisk.  And, of course, this is the first quarter that we'll
<BR>
actually record any decent revenue from GS Series server shipments.  I could
<BR>
name a billion reasons, but without hard actual sales numbers, there are some
<BR>
who just won't believe.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>P.S.  Just think about the DOE bid - 12,000 Alpha CPUs to one place for one bid
<BR>
by 2002.  Yikes.  Me wants one. ;)
