<EM>&gt; &gt; The front side bus is but the memory is standard PC.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Take a look at streams performance between a 21264 Alpha and an Athlon.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Athlons are a factor of two or more slower. Even though several Alphas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; use PC memory, they still blow away PIII and Athlon in memory bandwidth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; because their chipset interleaves the DIMM's.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is pretty much a factor of 2, no more. I can match speed with a 500mhz.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 21264 no problem with a 900 mhz. Thunderbird, specifically using Lightwave.
</EM><BR>
<P>Don't think that a doubling in clock speed can compensate for halving
<BR>
memory bandwidth.  For a great many apps, memory bandwidth is the single
<BR>
most important factor, more than clock speed.
<BR>
<P>I sometimes explain the memory problem as a race between a Corvette and
<BR>
Ferarri through downtown Chicago, in congested traffic, stop lights and
<BR>
25 mph speed limits.  Whichever wins, it probably has little to do with
<BR>
horsepower.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One point that will get the shit flamed out of me for saying, and did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at one point,  is that Lightwave was poorly optimized for the Alpha platform.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why would you get flamed for that?  I said near the beginning of this
<BR>
thread that many commercial vendors have poor support for non-mainstream
<BR>
platforms.  That much is obvious.  (I doubt if anyone from Lightwave
<BR>
reads this list, anyway, since they have little involvement with Alpha
<BR>
and none with Linux.)
<BR>
<P>Clearly the question for you is not &quot;which is better for general purpose
<BR>
computing, Alpha or Athlon&quot; but rather &quot;which hardware/OS does my
<BR>
software vendor support&quot;.  That question is really not on topic for
<BR>
axp-list.
