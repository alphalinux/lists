<EM>&gt; Hi all..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A few months ago there were some people (Dr Gilbert mainly) on this list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; working on using the Promise Ultra 66 controller on Alphas. I was given one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the other day and thought I might try to use it. I searched the archives and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; did not find anything conclusive as to whether it works or not and how well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it works. Has anyone had any luck with these? What kernel was required? I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tried putting in in my Cabriolet but it was not recognized at all in ARC.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is a single disk box so using one disk to boot and then initialize the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Promise thru the kernel is not an option.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The box i'd like to put it in is a PWS 500a. Alpha Bios 5.70 Any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggestions??
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I run them in XP1000's and UP2K's but none of them are
<BR>
bootable. Also, you need the IDE patches to get the
<BR>
kernel to recognize them. Lastly, I found putting more
<BR>
than one drive per channel is unstable, at least with
<BR>
a patched 2.2.15 or so kernel.
<BR>
<P>Heck, you can buy a 60GB Maxtor for around $220 now and
<BR>
an 80GB Maxtor for a little over $300. Prices so cheap it's
<BR>
hard to see why you can't use a separate disk for it.
<BR>
If you want real cheap, you can go with a 20GB drive for
<BR>
around $85. I use the 20-30GB drives for the built-in IDE
<BR>
to boot from, or, on the XP1000, leave the small SCSI drive
<BR>
as the boot device.
