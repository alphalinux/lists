Thanks for your help, Kurt.
<BR>
<P>Sorry it took a while to reply, but I've been working on this on and off for
<BR>
the last few days - I'm fairly new to linux, and even newer to alpha linux!
<BR>
I had to learn how to compile and install a new autofs rpm (I couldn't find
<BR>
an alpha-compiled one), then learn how to patch the kernel and recompile it
<BR>
- Phew!  :o)
<BR>
<P>Where I'm at now is this:-  I have installed autofs-4.0.0pre7-1 and patched
<BR>
the kernel as per the instructions at
<BR>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/daemons/autofs/testing-v4/README.">ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/daemons/autofs/testing-v4/README.</A>  The line
<BR>
you gave me for /etc/auto.master is included, slightly modified (I want
<BR>
/homes rather than /home).  I've rebooted and I'm pretty sure autofs is
<BR>
started, but the /homes directories are still not being mounted.  I checked
<BR>
the syslogs and this caught my attention:-
<BR>
<P>Sep 19 17:13:08 racoon automount[413]: starting automounter version 4.0.0,

Sep 19 17:13:09 racoon modprobe: modprobe: Can't locate module autofs

Sep 19 17:13:09 racoon automount[413]: cannot find autofs in kernel
<BR>
Sep 19 17:13:09 racoon automount[415]: cannot find autofs in kernel
<BR>
<P>The first three entries are encouraging, but the last four don't look too
<BR>
hot - does this mean the kernel patch hasn't worked?  The makes seemed to go
<BR>
OK, and I definitely chose to include the autofs stuff during the make
<BR>
config process...

&gt; Subject: RE: Automounting and NIS [OT]
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ok here's how to do it (it's not as easy on Linux as it is on 
&gt; solaris / DU)
&gt; 
&gt; first off, if you're running RHat 6.2 you need an updated autofs rpm
&gt; (the one I have here is autofs-4.0.0-pre7-11) because the one 
&gt; that came with
&gt; 6.2 for alpha doesn't work
&gt; 
&gt; set the config file /etc/auto.master to have a line like this:
&gt; 
&gt; /home yp:auto.home
&gt; 
&gt; (/home is the directory you want to automount to, then the 
&gt; yp:auto.master is
&gt; the config file that's exported via NIS)
&gt; 
&gt; next you need to start the svc (this one is obvious but I'll 
&gt; mention it
&gt; anyways)
&gt; 
&gt; see if that's any better. I had it running at one point and I broke it
&gt; somehow (I know not what I did... but again this is RH7 beta 
&gt; 3 that I'm
&gt; running, so anything could have caused it)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; lemmie know how you make out

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; OK, sorry it's a bit off-topic but in my defense a) the 
&gt; client is a Digital
&gt; PWS and b) I got no response from the redhat-list crew...
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone tell me how to get exported home directories to 
&gt; automount on my
&gt; PWS?  We have an NIS server that has the maps for our user 
&gt; accounts and
&gt; their home directories, and it works for all the irix, tru64 
&gt; and solaris
&gt; workstations we have but not for this a-linux one.  portmap, 
&gt; autofs and the
&gt; automount daemon are all running, and NIS is working to the 
&gt; extent that I
&gt; can get in with my user account but my home directory isn't 
&gt; mounting.  I've
&gt; been working on this for nearly a week now and I'm starting 
&gt; to feel really
&gt; stupid.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
