<P>
<EM>&gt; I wonder how that will be affected by the fact that their parent company Fox
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Animation closed it's doors recently.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Not much is my guess, as they aren앖 tied to Fox Animation, from what I understand
<BR>
they았e been moved over to Fox directly.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A total of 4 apps. Not exactly a strong endorsement of a well supported product.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
As were talking about Linux software, you can say that about any platform realy, 
<BR>
the only thing available on others(x86) is the Maya Renderer and ElectroGig.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A single reference with no details. Also to Blue Sky, as in the first reference. So
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; far, the implication seems that Blue Sky was the only reference Compaq could come
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up with for studios still using the Alpha platform.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
There are a lot more ref압 available, but my guess is that either Compaq압 PR isn앖 moving
<BR>
all that fast or the custormers does not want to be a part of PR.
<BR>
You can look at a company like PDI that have been an avid supporter of SGI압 Irix machines
<BR>
for a realy long time, at Siggraph this year they publicly stated that they have ported all their
<BR>
inhouse software to Alpha Linux.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yet another rehash of one of the previous links provided. This time listing only 2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the 4 software titles mentioned in the first link.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
well there are 3 packages available(Chalice, Rayz and Chake).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What would appear to be a plethora of links proving that the Alpha is still a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strong contender is quickly dismissed when one reads the material presented. These
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; links do little more than repeat the same material over and over. They certainly do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not give much credibility to the Alpha does Hollywood Impression that is being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; presented.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Honestly I could find more Amiga links that would make it appear as if Amigas and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Video Toasters were still strong contenders in the content creation arena that was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; provided here for Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To be quite blunt, I would be embarassed to present this list of links as any kind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of evidence. They are far too weak, easily dismissed and pitifully lacking in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; content.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
I wouldn앖 realy, what you seem to forget Steve is that about 1 year ago there was little
<BR>
talk about Linux at all during Siggraph, this year there was talk about Linux in every booth.
<BR>
Also the complaint압 you have about available software is valid in parts, but if you look
<BR>
at what they았e done so far it압 realy avoid anything GUI related and got a lot of rendering
<BR>
software(both 2D and 3D) over while OGL and GUI압 mature. I think if we have the same
<BR>
chat next year the picture will look quite different.
<BR>
<P>Then again I don앖 realy understand why you rack down on Alpha Linux(and Linux in general)
<BR>
in a Alpha Linux ML as it serves little purpose realy ;D
<BR>
