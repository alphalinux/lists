<P>Sorry, have not followed this for a bit, does that run NT or is it Linux only?

<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; IF Newtek could be persuaded to port Lightwave 6.x to Alpha Linux, that would be

<EM>&gt; &gt; something. But Linux still has a long way to go in the way of support.

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree that Lightwave on Alpha Linux would make an exelent application and it would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; talk newtek about 2 hrs to do it(took me about 35 minutes to convert the SDK to Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux) as they aleardy have IRIX, OSX, SOLARIS up and running. The one to talk to about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that would be Brad Peebler, but Newtek seems to be kindof not willing to see the benefit of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to Linux as a production machine.
</EM><BR>
<P>Odd considering they seem to be the last to show interest in Linux. All the really major
<BR>
packages have either released or announced. Maya recently said their decision was based on
<BR>
overwhelming customer demand, I find it very hard to believe that Newtek has not heard the call
<BR>
from the user base like the others have.
<BR>
<P>Unless of course they strictly go by the results of flame wars on the LW3D lists.........
<BR>
<P>Certainly the subject has come up enough........
