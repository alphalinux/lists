<P><EM>&gt; The front side bus is but the memory is standard PC.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Take a look at streams performance between a 21264 Alpha and an Athlon.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Athlons are a factor of two or more slower. Even though several Alphas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use PC memory, they still blow away PIII and Athlon in memory bandwidth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because their chipset interleaves the DIMM's.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is pretty much a factor of 2, no more. I can match speed with a 500mhz. 21264 no problem
<BR>
with a 900 mhz. Thunderbird, specifically using Lightwave. As that is almost 100% of my usage
<BR>
(3D apps, and Lightwave is almost the only app I can compare similar code on both hardware
<BR>
platforms. That and SoftImage)
<BR>
<P>One point that will get the shit flamed out of me for saying, and did at one point,  is that
<BR>
Lightwave was poorly optimized for the Alpha platform. (actually not at all). A lot of people
<BR>
told me I was full of shit for saying that, even though they were admittedly using VC4 as their
<BR>
compiler. Also I noticed the difference in performance between the Intel and Alpha platforms
<BR>
were much wider on renders in SoftImage than they were between platforms on Lightwave.
<BR>
<P>Also, you can interleave the Dimms on the Athlon as well.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; Please note that I said Classic Athlon. That has 512k off die cache, running at less than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; full cpu speed. The same test on the latest Thunderbird processors at 900 mhz. comes out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to around 250-260 seconds.  A full 40-60 seconds faster than the 21264/500.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Exactly what I said. Your vendor is screwing you in terms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of Alpha performance. I have 900 Mhz t-birds and they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are no match for my Alphas on all codes I run. Note that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is ALL codes. In no instance are Athlons faster than my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 21264's.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are still missing the point. You seem to think I am Alpha bashing or something which is far
<BR>
from accurate. However, the Alpha is in a no win situation. Sure 64 bit is better, and I do not
<BR>
for a second argue that your points are valid or not. The bottom line is that no matter how
<BR>
good the Alpha is, I can easily outperform it by simply adding another machine.
<BR>
<P>The cost factor alone keeps Alpha from being a viable solution, that and lack of software since
<BR>
my only choices are Linux, Tru64 and VMS.
