<P>Convergence Points
<BR>
Itanium is late to liberate
<BR>
<P>By Peter Coffee 
<BR>
September 11, 2000 12:00 AM ET
<BR>
<P>Get ready for a remake of the pivotal scene in &quot;Patton,&quot; where British
<BR>
forces triumphantly &quot;liberate&quot; a city-only to find American tanks lined up
<BR>
in the town square to greet them. 
<BR>
<P>In the role of the embarrassed Field Marshal Montgomery will be Intel's
<BR>
long-delayed Itanium; in the title role of Gen. Patton will be Compaq
<BR>
systems powered by Alpha CPUs, already freeing our toughest jobs from their
<BR>
computational limits. 
<BR>
<P>Alpha arrays are dominating rivals in high-performance computing. In
<BR>
mid-August, the U.S. Department of Energy announced that Compaq will build a
<BR>
12,000-Alpha system with clock rates exceeding 1,250MHz; in other wins this
<BR>
year, U.S. and French sites have chosen Compaq/Alpha for tasks from drug
<BR>
design to climate modeling. 
<BR>
<P>Like Gen. Patton, the Alpha chip has had its ups and downs. At the end of
<BR>
1998, Microsoft promised Alpha- targeting versions of Windows tools; in
<BR>
April 1999, Microsoft demonstrated an Alpha-hosted 64-bit Windows. But that
<BR>
August, Redmond pulled the plug on Windows for non-Intel chips. Sic transit
<BR>
gloria Alpha? Wait for the second reel. 
<BR>
<P>This January, Red Hat released its Linux 6.1 Deluxe for Alpha at $79.95;
<BR>
April saw SuSE's Linux 6.4 for Alpha at $49.95; and July brought
<BR>
TurboLinux's Alpha Linux at the same price with 60 days' free support. 
<BR>
<P>If you don't want to take a chance on open-source systems, you can run your
<BR>
Alpha on Compaq's Tru64 Unix; if that combo is good enough for Oracle's ASP
<BR>
partner, Nupremis, it can probably handle your workload as well (while
<BR>
733MHz Itaniums wait for Windows 2001). 
<BR>
<P>The Intel/Microsoft axis will make a noisy entry this fall-but like
<BR>
Montgomery's bagpipes, they'll find themselves facing the massive brass band
<BR>
of the Alphas already in town. 
<BR>
