<EM>&gt;      Dear Rich,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thanx for the very instructive, at least for me, lesson.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, from SPECfp benchmarks, it seems that an AMD 600 MHz should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more or less 3 times slower than a 21264 666 MHz.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But the alpha is roughly 6 times more expensive...
</EM><BR>
<P>If you go with a UP1000 700, and assemble it yourself, it
<BR>
would be more like 4x, last I looked at prices. Depends on
<BR>
which Athlon too. The faster they are, the higher the cost
<BR>
per Mhz.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you have a nice parallelized code, as in my case, maybe better to buy a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; small 6 AMD cluster instead of a single alpha.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Don't know about your situation, but there is usually serial code
<BR>
hanging around used to handle the &quot;simple&quot; stuff and that code will
<BR>
run faster on Alphas.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now, I have a small budget (academy usally has not lot of money) and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really don't know whether to go for 2 UP1000 or 12 AMD 600.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Consider your parts list. 12 power supplies to go bad,
<BR>
12 disks, 12 floppies, 12 network cards, 12 video cards,
<BR>
12 motherboards, at least 12 DIMMs, etc. Your odds of
<BR>
having a failure are worse due to higher HW counts.
<BR>
The other issue is space. 2 UP2K's fit in 6U of rack space.
<BR>
12 AMD's, using 2U cases, would be 24U. Even at 1U, which
<BR>
requires special parts, you have 12U. Now when dual CPU
<BR>
socket A motherboards appear, you're back down to equivalent
<BR>
space use. Dual PIII motherboards in a 2U case would give
<BR>
you less parts, less cost, and higher density.
<BR>
<P>I'd really like to see a dual cpu UP1100, or, a DS10L with
<BR>
dual cpus. That would be awesome compute per rack unit.
<BR>
<P>Then there is that old 64bit vs 32bit problem. If you don't
<BR>
need 64bit, you actually have a choice. If you must have 64bit,
<BR>
then for now Athlon and Intel are out.
