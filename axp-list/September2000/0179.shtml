That sounds like a very good plan.
<BR>
<P>Newtek is already dealing with Solaris, OSX for Mac is coming soon, it seems Newtek already has some
<BR>
apples in the Unix cart already.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps Compaq could push the Newtek/Tru64 angle?
<BR>
<P>Seems I recall hearing that Tru64 apps run on linux or something like that.......
