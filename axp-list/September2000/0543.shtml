<P>
I have 10 PWS 500a, 2 of which have what appear to be dead ethernet
<BR>
controllers.  These devices present themselves to the AlphaBIOS as Digital
<BR>
21143-PB/C &amp; DS21143 Tulip (rev 48).  The card is about is 3.5 inches
<BR>
square and is connected to the system board by a cable.  I swapped these
<BR>
little boards out to isolate the ones that do not work, and oddly enough,
<BR>
it appears as though the MAC address for the system is contained on the
<BR>
system board as that address does not change when swapping the card.   I
<BR>
have never had any experience with these little guys.  Can anyone tell me
<BR>
where I might find a couple of replacements for these and what they are
<BR>
called and maybe about how much they cost?  Any help would be appreciated.
<BR>
Thanks;
<BR>
-Alan
