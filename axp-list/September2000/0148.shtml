True, it does come down to economics.
<BR>
<P>However, I doubt crowds of Linux fans chipped in and paid for a Maya port. AW claims that reason was
<BR>
customer demand.
<BR>
<P>I know Digital Domain LOVES Linux, and they have a Lightwave division.
<BR>
<P>Sure it comes down to economics, but it seems to me that based on the rest of the marketplace, there
<BR>
is certainly enough demand for a linux port. I cannot for a second believe that Newtek is the only
<BR>
one that is not getting a show of interest from their customer base.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Odd considering they seem to be the last to show interest in Linux. All the really major

<EM>&gt; &gt; overwhelming customer demand, I find it very hard to believe that Newtek has not heard the call

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Rumor has it, and this has been ONLY RUMOR that SUN and IBM paid a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deal of money for a port.  I'd say that if the money paid for a port is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; high enough, then it makes sense for them to NOT port it until somone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pays?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again, the debate comes down to economics.--
