<EM>&gt; However, I doubt crowds of Linux fans chipped in and paid for a Maya port. AW claims that reason was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; customer demand.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course, any company will say that. ;)  It sounds much better to say &quot;we listened to our customers&quot;
<BR>
than &quot;we took a big bribe&quot;.  It may be true, but I suppose it's possible that neither the briber nor
<BR>
the bribee want anyone to know... *shrug*

<EM>&gt; I know Digital Domain LOVES Linux, and they have a Lightwave division.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sure it comes down to economics, but it seems to me that based on the rest of the marketplace, there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is certainly enough demand for a linux port. I cannot for a second believe that Newtek is the only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one that is not getting a show of interest from their customer base.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I was just on their website and there have been requests on the discussion pages (last one as of 08/31
<BR>
if I read it correctly).  There just haven't been any answers.  Anyone know who to ping directly over
<BR>
there?  I'll check inside here, but I don't know what I'll turn up with.

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Odd considering they seem to be the last to show interest in Linux. All the really major
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; packages have either released or announced. Maya recently said their decision was based on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; overwhelming customer demand, I find it very hard to believe that Newtek has not heard the call
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; from the user base like the others have.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Rumor has it, and this has been ONLY RUMOR that SUN and IBM paid a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; deal of money for a port.  I'd say that if the money paid for a port is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; high enough, then it makes sense for them to NOT port it until somone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pays?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Again, the debate comes down to economics.--
