<EM>&gt; &gt; Odd considering they seem to be the last to show interest in Linux. All the really major

<EM>&gt; Rumor has it, and this has been ONLY RUMOR that SUN and IBM paid a good

<EM>&gt; deal of money for a port.  I'd say that if the money paid for a port is

<EM>&gt; high enough, then it makes sense for them to NOT port it until somone

<EM>&gt; pays?

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; Again, the debate comes down to economics.

<P>Okay, I see now that there isn't even a LW version for Linux on Intel yet - that makes the picture
<BR>
considerably different.  Maybe the bribery shouldn't just come from a (mostly hardware) company like
<BR>
Compaq, but from someone like Suse or RedHat?  Obviously I have much less pull there personally and
<BR>
will continue on internally, but it would make some sense for the people that will get the most out
<BR>
of it (pure Linux companies) to fund at least the Intel port and have Compaq or API (or both) work
<BR>
to make sure that it also appears on Alpha.  Does that sound logical?  If so, maybe someone can
<BR>
hound Suse or RedHat (or whomever) to go after this opportunity.
