<EM>&gt; &gt; So here are the real questions:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  - Is having 3D rendering programs on Alpha (let's say Alpha Linux for now) desirable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; by you?  (Wider audience -  how many would pay for them, and at which premium - the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; one for Windows or UNIX?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Fortunately, a number of mainstream programs are going Linux. Houdini was released
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already for Linux, Maya is being released soon etc. Fortunately, this brief flirtation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with M$ NT crap is rapidly coming to an end.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>So then the availability of software for Linux is not a hindrance, right?  Just the fact that
<BR>
it's only Intel Linux and not Alpha Linux.  I want to make sure my messages are clear so I
<BR>
don't bark up a tree and have a bee's nest dropped on my head ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Certainly from a technical point the Alpha is preferable. Of course there are some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; financial considerations as well. When the Alpha was 7,000.00 box and was WAY out ahead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of 4,000.00 PC box, it was one thing. However, when you can build very fast and very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; powerful systems for dirt cheap and the Alpha is pushing 10-15 grand for a box, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chioce gets much harder.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, that's my next question.  What I meant here was, say the software is available for
<BR>
Alpha Linux - would you be willing to (all other things being equal) pay a premium for having
<BR>
it there and if so in what kind of ballpark?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  - What price point would you need a DS10 (DS10L now, I guess) to meet in order to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; more cost effective for your work than the Athlons currently available?  For example:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; say the Alpha is 2x as fast as the latest Athlon which costs $2k for a full system,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; so the Alpha should cost no more than $4k.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I find that completely logical. It is also a point I could sell to management. But when I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tell them the Alpha is 2x as fast and cost 10k as opposed to 2k for the Athlon, they will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tell me to go buy 5 Athlons. My average completion time is faster, and therefore, this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a better buy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Sorry, that was supposed to be an example.  I have no idea how much faster our Alpha Whizbang
<BR>
2000 is than an Athlon - that's why I'm asking the question.  Let me restate.  Assuming an
<BR>
Alpha is faster than an Athlon for these given jobs, at what price point does the performance
<BR>
difference become worth less than the additional cost.  Basically, how much extra would you
<BR>
be willing to pay for an Alpha given that the software is available?  (Which is the context
<BR>
of my first question - circular, isn't it? ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If I can get some sort of a consensus I'll take whatever I get to Compaq management
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and lobby for support (what form it takes to be decided).  If Alpha is as dead or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; dying in the rendering business as you say it is, maybe this will be its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; resurrection.  Whatever else I may be, I will do my damnedest to get this done if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people really want it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Last year at Siggraph, StationX Studios shared the booth with API, they were showing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prerelease version of their animation software called Messiah. (runs on Alpha and x86) I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had voiced concerns over Alpha at the time and asked if both versions came on the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disc as many other apps did. I was told it did not, but was recommended that I get the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Intel version if I had doubts since &quot;people were dumping Alphas left and right&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Can I just ask the larger audience - if you hear a company say this type of thing let me
<BR>
know.  I'll send it along the line and I'm sure our version of Bruno The Enforcer will have a
<BR>
talking-to with them.  It seems we (Compaq, or at least me anyway) always hear these
<BR>
statements well after it's too late to do something about it.  I want to change that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; At the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time I doubted this, but since the Athlons have come out, numerous Lightwave effects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; houses have ditched most or all of their Alpha equipment. We dumped 20 systems, and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have helped others that were also transitioning to Athlon and selling Alpha equipment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;From numerous reliable sources and associates, Alphas are getting dumped faster than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Amigas were.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, that I can't argue with.  But I _am_ at least going to try to change it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, price may not be the only deciding factor in Alpha getting back into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; production market. Newtek holds a 51% marketshare in studios and production houses, with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SoftImage, Maya and others splitting up the balance. Only a couple of these have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; announced Linux solutions, and even less Alpha Linux.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IF Newtek could be persuaded to port Lightwave 6.x to Alpha Linux, that would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something. But Linux still has a long way to go in the way of support.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>_This_ is something that I needed to know.  You tell us what you need, and we'll see what we
<BR>
can do about getting it there.  That's our job, plain and simple.  I'll bring that suggestion
<BR>
forward.  But I'll need one more detail to get anywhere - how many people would be willing to
<BR>
at least contemplate continued/renewed/new use of Alpha as a platform?  Or perhaps, would
<BR>
this have a trickle-down effect of getting other shops to port to Alpha Linux?  (Yes, I'm
<BR>
looking for an angle to sell this with. :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I despised having to sell my Alpha systems, but when it got to the point that I could not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use the latest tools, they became a hinderance that did nothing more than take up space.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I hear that loud and clear.  Until I got a copy of Applix that worked reasonably well, I had
<BR>
to bounce back and forth between my Alpha workstation and my PC.  But hopefully that will
<BR>
change soon enough as well...
<BR>
<P>To the drawing board....
