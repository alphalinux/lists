hi,
<BR>
<P>to give some info about the glide stuff/status:
<BR>
<P>i have started to port glide to linux/alpha in december last year (if i remember corr).
<BR>
<P>it never worked on my alpha (alphastation255 / ev45 / apecs / avanti) because /dev/3dfx
<BR>
(3dfx.o / 3dfx_driver.c) was not working correctly (mapped the pci stuff wrong).
<BR>
i did not know that, so i stopped working on it.
<BR>
phillip ezolt had some success - /dev/3dfx worked on his machine - i dont know why.
<BR>
<P>i corrected the /dev/3dfx error recently (have not worked on glide for 6 months or so).
<BR>
the new version and a patch is attached (hope that it is allowed to post files to this list).
<BR>
i sent this to the joseph kain already who put the 3dfx driver into the web.
<BR>
he said:
<BR>
&quot;Ok, I'll take a look and should be able to apply them to the CVS
<BR>
tree soon.&quot;
<BR>
<P>in dec last year i just took the glide3x tree and started porting.
<BR>
because things changed a lot i grabbed the latest GlideV2 tree recently and
<BR>
started the port from beginning (i have a voodoo2).
<BR>
things are going quite well.
<BR>
yesterday i made the mapping of the pci mem into virt mem of glide work.
<BR>
the libs still crash, but - to some point - it is possible to debug.
<BR>
(GlideV2 patch from yesterday is also attached).
<BR>
<P>i am looking forward to get &quot;spinning things&quot; (mentioned in one mail about this topic)
<BR>
(the stuff phillip ezolt got to work) work in this month.
<BR>
but dont hold your breath!
<BR>
linus torvalds sayed that linux-2.4.0 will be out in dec 1999 ;-)
<BR>
so it could be that it will take me 1,2,3,4,... months longer too ;-)
<BR>
(i am just a human who does regular work and who has a lovely girlfriend).
<BR>
<P>niki w. waibel
