<P>
<EM>&gt;          You're not going to get an EV6 system for $500 unless someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;          starts buying them at volumes like an x86. Sorry. Believe me,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;          I wish we could sell them cheaper! I'd love nothing more than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;          to see every Linux developer running on Alpha. I wish I could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;          figure out how to get even 30% of them to run on Alpha!
</EM><BR>
<P>And unless something has changed radically recently, it's going to cost you
<BR>
$500 just for the SRM console!... that was the old price difference between
<BR>
the ARC board and the SRM board for the 21164. Identical boards - only the
<BR>
SRM was the difference. And THAT was purely a marketing decision, not based
<BR>
on any kind of product strategy -- only on showing a profit for the SRM
<BR>
group. 
<BR>
<P>As for volume, what about Alphas in the X-box?
<BR>
<P>Rumor, what rumor? I just said that because it would make sense. But alas,
<BR>
that would require a marketing insight beyond anything we've seen thus far
<BR>
from the Q. [After all, NT has already been ported to the Alpha.]
<BR>
Remember, there have been more Dreamcasts Sold than all of the PCs ever
<BR>
manufactured, combined!  And that was just in Japan. (Or some rediculous
<BR>
comparison like that. But the reason for the X-box IS the incredibly huge
<BR>
volume of consoles sold.
