<P><EM>&gt; So here are the real questions:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  - Is having 3D rendering programs on Alpha (let's say Alpha Linux for now) desirable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by you?  (Wider audience -  how many would pay for them, and at which premium - the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one for Windows or UNIX?)
</EM><BR>
<P>Fortunately, a number of mainstream programs are going Linux. Houdini was released
<BR>
already for Linux, Maya is being released soon etc. Fortunately, this brief flirtation
<BR>
with M$ NT crap is rapidly coming to an end.
<BR>
<P>Certainly from a technical point the Alpha is preferable. Of course there are some
<BR>
financial considerations as well. When the Alpha was 7,000.00 box and was WAY out ahead
<BR>
of 4,000.00 PC box, it was one thing. However, when you can build very fast and very
<BR>
powerful systems for dirt cheap and the Alpha is pushing 10-15 grand for a box, the
<BR>
chioce gets much harder.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;  - What price point would you need a DS10 (DS10L now, I guess) to meet in order to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more cost effective for your work than the Athlons currently available?  For example:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; say the Alpha is 2x as fast as the latest Athlon which costs $2k for a full system,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so the Alpha should cost no more than $4k.
</EM><BR>
<P>I find that completely logical. It is also a point I could sell to management. But when I
<BR>
tell them the Alpha is 2x as fast and cost 10k as opposed to 2k for the Athlon, they will
<BR>
tell me to go buy 5 Athlons. My average completion time is faster, and therefore, this is
<BR>
a better buy.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; If I can get some sort of a consensus I'll take whatever I get to Compaq management
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and lobby for support (what form it takes to be decided).  If Alpha is as dead or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dying in the rendering business as you say it is, maybe this will be its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resurrection.  Whatever else I may be, I will do my damnedest to get this done if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people really want it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Last year at Siggraph, StationX Studios shared the booth with API, they were showing the
<BR>
prerelease version of their animation software called Messiah. (runs on Alpha and x86) I
<BR>
had voiced concerns over Alpha at the time and asked if both versions came on the same
<BR>
disc as many other apps did. I was told it did not, but was recommended that I get the
<BR>
Intel version if I had doubts since &quot;people were dumping Alphas left and right&quot; At the
<BR>
time I doubted this, but since the Athlons have come out, numerous Lightwave effects
<BR>
houses have ditched most or all of their Alpha equipment. We dumped 20 systems, and I
<BR>
have helped others that were also transitioning to Athlon and selling Alpha equipment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;From numerous reliable sources and associates, Alphas are getting dumped faster than
</EM><BR>
Amigas were.
<BR>
<P>However, price may not be the only deciding factor in Alpha getting back into the
<BR>
production market. Newtek holds a 51% marketshare in studios and production houses, with
<BR>
SoftImage, Maya and others splitting up the balance. Only a couple of these have
<BR>
announced Linux solutions, and even less Alpha Linux.
<BR>
<P>IF Newtek could be persuaded to port Lightwave 6.x to Alpha Linux, that would be
<BR>
something. But Linux still has a long way to go in the way of support.
<BR>
<P>I despised having to sell my Alpha systems, but when it got to the point that I could not
<BR>
use the latest tools, they became a hinderance that did nothing more than take up space.
