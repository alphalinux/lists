<EM>&gt; .You don't have 2MB of SRAM cache on the board(have you priced that?)

<P>Athlons need it too.  Supposedly the K7 will support up to 8MB L2 cache.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; .You don't have more than 4-5 layers of etch meaning almost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any vendor in Taiwan can make it. Cheap.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Consequently, you don't have greater signalling issues.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (count the number of pins on EV6 .vs. Athlon) All these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; add to the cost.
</EM><BR>
<P>Umm... am I mistaken that the K7 and EV6 are bus compatible?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You're not going to get an EV6 system for $500 unless someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; starts buying them at volumes like an x86. Sorry. Believe me,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I wish we could sell them cheaper! I'd love nothing more than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to see every Linux developer running on Alpha. I wish I could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; figure out how to get even 30% of them to run on Alpha!
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, I understand.  I think the treshold from workstation to server for
<BR>
us is around $2k.  For a little more we could buy Sun hardware or maybe
<BR>
some UP1100's.  I don't know if we are typical, but we like to have
<BR>
developer workstations of a similar architecture as our servers, so we
<BR>
can develop/test/debug locally or remote with fewer surprises.
<BR>
<P>I was encouraged back when Digital released the PC164SX boards... they
<BR>
sacrificed some performance for lower cost, but at least they lowered
<BR>
the barrier to developing software for Alpha.  But there hasn't been
<BR>
anything similar since the SX, not counting discontinued hardware.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for the info.
