<EM>&gt; &gt;  - What price point would you need a DS10 (DS10L now, I guess) to meet in order to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; more cost effective for your work than the Athlons currently available?  For example:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; say the Alpha is 2x as fast as the latest Athlon which costs $2k for a full system,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; so the Alpha should cost no more than $4k.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I find that completely logical. It is also a point I could sell to management. But when I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tell them the Alpha is 2x as fast and cost 10k as opposed to 2k for the Athlon, they will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tell me to go buy 5 Athlons. My average completion time is faster, and therefore, this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a better buy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
The UP1000 goes for 2995 USD and from what I understand the UP1100 is even cheaper.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However, price may not be the only deciding factor in Alpha getting back into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; production market. Newtek holds a 51% marketshare in studios and production houses, with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SoftImage, Maya and others splitting up the balance. Only a couple of these have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; announced Linux solutions, and even less Alpha Linux.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IF Newtek could be persuaded to port Lightwave 6.x to Alpha Linux, that would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something. But Linux still has a long way to go in the way of support.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
I agree that Lightwave on Alpha Linux would make an exelent application and it would
<BR>
talk newtek about 2 hrs to do it(took me about 35 minutes to convert the SDK to Alpha
<BR>
Linux) as they aleardy have IRIX, OSX, SOLARIS up and running. The one to talk to about
<BR>
that would be Brad Peebler, but Newtek seems to be kindof not willing to see the benefit of
<BR>
going to Linux as a production machine.
