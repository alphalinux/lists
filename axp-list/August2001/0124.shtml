<EM>&gt;started to sleep if nobody was typing, this slowed the Fan down and

<EM>&gt;than somthing braked the cpu to 1/10 th of its speed.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now after fixin the settings it is working ok, but the benchmarks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;still show a variance of 5% . We have no idea why.

<P>I'm strolling through the BIOS now.  Do you know what changes in setting
<BR>
you made, and what you set them to?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I read the P4 has a thermal sensor in the cpu that can slow it down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if it gets to hot. Unfortunately there seems to be no was to find out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;when this is taking place. So it's easy, to make complete correct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;benchmark runs were the P4 is solwer then a P3/500
</EM><BR>
<P>I think that's called the &quot;Speed Step&quot; technology, where high speed FP
<BR>
operations causes the chip temperature to rise, and at some point, the
<BR>
CPU needs to slow down so it does not burn itself up.
<BR>
<P>Also, we found programs compiled under GCC to be pretty slow on the
<BR>
system, and were told that we need to use Intel's compilers that made
<BR>
use of the SSE1/2 instruction optimization to achieve full performance.
<BR>
Unfortunately, the compilers are only in beta phase, and do not seem to
<BR>
work on the Linux 2.4.2-2 that we're using right now.
