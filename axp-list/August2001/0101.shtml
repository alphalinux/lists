Hi Folks,
<BR>
<P>I was wondering how to get onto a Pentium Linux discussion group?
<BR>
I have a problem that may be arcane or mundane, I don't know, but I
<BR>
need to find a solution as quickly as possible.  I have just gotten
<BR>
a number of P4/1.7 GHz systems running RH 7.1, 2.4.2-2.  These are
<BR>
using the 850GB boards originally designed for workstations, but
<BR>
installed into rackmount enclosures with 400 W power supplies and
<BR>
surrounded by fans.
<BR>
<P>The problem is that on 3 of them, when i run the benchFFT program from
<BR>
fftw.org, they freeze up after some period of running.  On a 4th one,
<BR>
the program has actually run through completion without hanging the
<BR>
machine, but the performance seems to be inconsistent.
<BR>
<P>I was suspecting that they may be running into Linux incompatibility
<BR>
problems, or the Intel &quot;speed-step&quot; technology that's slowing or
<BR>
shutting down the processor when FP operations make the CPU too hot.
<BR>
However, their exhaust temperatures are consistently a few degrees
<BR>
lower than the UP2000+ systes I have in the same rack.
<BR>
<P>So, does anyone know of a source of information pertaining to P4/linux
<BR>
and their problems?
<BR>
<P>thanks,
<BR>
eyc
