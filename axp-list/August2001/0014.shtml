<EM>&gt; With regards to your message at 10:11 AM 8/4/01, Helge Kreutzmann. Where 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you stated:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;We have the fan of the power supply and the fan on the CPU. Currently 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the case is open to (hopefully) reduce heat congestion inside the box.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Do you think it is sensible to add some additional fans ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Absolutely!
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll second that!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The fan in the power supply is definitely not enough to cool this type
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of machine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I strongly recommend adding another fan, preferably at the back pulling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; air out of the case but one in the front pushing air can be OK too, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long as the airflow path goes over the components.
</EM><BR>
<P>That may also not be enough.  I've found on my Alpha and X86 boxen just
<BR>
adding a fan in the lower front of the case is needed to pull cool air
<BR>
from the outside and push it back into the case and then the fan in the
<BR>
back pulls it out the rest of the way.
<BR>
<P>On thing to try if you have a chip that needs cooling is to take a
<BR>
little 486 CPU fan and arrange it to blow air over the item in question.
<BR>
Depending on where this is in your case, you may have to get tricky with
<BR>
twisty ties.  I have that setup on my PC64 because the cache RAM got
<BR>
pretty warm after several hours of use.  Just by aiming the fan to blow
<BR>
over the chips, they remained cool to the touch.  If that helps, you
<BR>
might want to look into a permanent solution.  For the people that
<BR>
overclock items in their systems, several companies sell heatsink and
<BR>
fan combos that are used for video card cooling.  Some of those are
<BR>
small enough and are sold to be used on a motherboard chip.
