<P>
Does anyone have any ideas, outside of conspiracy theories, why the DOJ
<BR>
hasn't said anything against this clearly anti-competitive transaction?
<BR>
Just curious.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   Very good input from Micahel Huntingdon.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ditto... but is it just whistling past the graveyard?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   We allso said allmost the same things to Compaq people and they said: No, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   Alpha and Itanium designs are very different in 2 places which is basically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   incompatible: 1. The CPU switching and 2. the 4 procesor states (needed for at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   least VMS) in Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   They said that Msoft would have difficulties making an NT/XP (whatever) for 64
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   bit if current Itanium design is changed to Alpha design.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; These two are OS issues, and spell trouble for VMS (Compaq) vs XP (Microsoft).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, who do you suppose Compaq will support?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My problem is quite simple. And I have pointed it out to several people who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simply cringe when they realize what I have said.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So far N O T H I N G has been said about the Alpha purchase by Intel!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Intel has posted a copy of the press release and pointed everyone to Compaq
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for &quot;other information.&quot; No other words have been spoken, let alone written.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The slides posted on the Inquirer site are Compaq's slides, not Intel's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slides. The Intel IA64 road-map is unchanged.... in 2004 the IA64 still will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perform slower than today's Alphas.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've been in this business a long time, but some things have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constants.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I used RCA gear when Univac bought RCA... Univac had no clue what they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bought.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I used VAX and Alpha gear when Compaq bought Digital ... Compaq had no idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what they bought.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now I use Alpha when Intel bought it... and I see zero indication that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Intel has a clue what they bought.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Intel did not purchase the technology to eliminate competition. It was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; purchased because Alpha has many years and a great deal of money already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; behind the advanced research and engineering. Alpha also has nearly 10
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; years of unsurpassed/stable performance behind it. Sounds reasonably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; compelling, especially if you are a company who, for quite some time, has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; been telling the world you'll be providing CPU technology that will offer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the best performance in the industry.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Don't forget, the last sentence in the paragraph has never been true and is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simply Intel's attempt to fend off the Anti-Trust lawywers. (And except for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maybe, the very begining, I do mean never.) Other CPUs have always out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; performed Intel ever since RISC happened, and one can easliy argue that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; VAX CPU also out performed the Intel CPU. And even without Apple, AMD will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support the &quot;megahertz-myth&quot; proposition. Intel may have offered &quot;good&quot; but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the masss rarely ever get &quot;the best.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You'll notice that even in the defense -- the fact that Alpha was already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at the point where Intel could never hope to get is not mentioned; that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha was 2-3 years ahead of Itanium performance with the gap widening.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Although the way some Classic Compaq folks explained the decision to drop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha  -- the IA64 would have had performance which surpassed the Alpha by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2004, so why should we bother to compete.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The difference between a CICS and a RISC instruction set is significant.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Compilers can &quot;deal with it,&quot; and no doubt will. BUT the argument between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CICS and RISC all along has been we're faster than you are... and RISC won.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The dominant reason for dropping the port of Tru64 to IA64 years ago was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the port ran faster on the IA64 emulator running on the Alpha than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it did on IA64 silicon -- so why bother.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, I think that you will see an IA64 that simply looks like the existing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IA64 designs -- but with compilers that can fix the branch prediction that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the hardware can't do, and maybe the lock-step instructions that Tandem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; needs which should have been in EV7 (they haven't been mentioned that I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seen.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, will Itanium really be &quot;Alpha inside?&quot; Or will it continue to be &quot;PARC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inside?&quot; The philosophy between the two is very different, and compilers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't change that. Is Intel willing to admit that they &quot;screwed up&quot; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; start over? Or will they simply try to &quot;fix&quot; what is an inherently flawed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; design. Sadly, history teaches us that it will be the latter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Until Intel makes a presentation on the future, we will have zero idea what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that future looks like on the inside. &quot;We&quot; (the Encomapass aka DECUS - UNIX
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TAG - Techincal Advisory Group aka Unix Sig) have asked Q to ask Intel to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; come talk to us at CETS2001 in Ananheim next month. Maybe they will --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, I don't think they will, I think we'll just get Compaq telling us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what their vision of the future is, just like the slides from the Inquirer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (The session planner is due to come up today, so we'll see if anything can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be determined from the session list.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm still afraid that Intel simply got rid of a very nasty competitor.
