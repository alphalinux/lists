<P>
<EM>&gt;   From: Peter Bech &lt;peterb@informi.com&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Date: Thu, 9 Aug 2001 10:05:46 +0200
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Very good input from Micahel Huntingdon.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Ditto... but is it just whistling past the graveyard?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   We allso said allmost the same things to Compaq people and they said: No, the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Alpha and Itanium designs are very different in 2 places which is basically 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   incompatible: 1. The CPU switching and 2. the 4 procesor states (needed for at 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   least VMS) in Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   They said that Msoft would have difficulties making an NT/XP (whatever) for 64 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   bit if current Itanium design is changed to Alpha design.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
These two are OS issues, and spell trouble for VMS (Compaq) vs XP (Microsoft). 
<BR>
So, who do you suppose Compaq will support?
<BR>
<P>My problem is quite simple. And I have pointed it out to several people who
<BR>
simply cringe when they realize what I have said.
<BR>
<P>So far N O T H I N G has been said about the Alpha purchase by Intel!
<BR>
<P>Intel has posted a copy of the press release and pointed everyone to Compaq
<BR>
for &quot;other information.&quot; No other words have been spoken, let alone written.
<BR>
<P>The slides posted on the Inquirer site are Compaq's slides, not Intel's
<BR>
slides. The Intel IA64 road-map is unchanged.... in 2004 the IA64 still will
<BR>
perform slower than today's Alphas.
<BR>
<P>I've been in this business a long time, but some things have been
<BR>
constants. 
<BR>
<P>I used RCA gear when Univac bought RCA... Univac had no clue what they
<BR>
bought.
<BR>
<P>I used VAX and Alpha gear when Compaq bought Digital ... Compaq had no idea
<BR>
what they bought.
<BR>
<P>Now I use Alpha when Intel bought it... and I see zero indication that
<BR>
Intel has a clue what they bought.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Intel did not purchase the technology to eliminate competition. It was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purchased because Alpha has many years and a great deal of money already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; behind the advanced research and engineering. Alpha also has nearly 10
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years of unsurpassed/stable performance behind it. Sounds reasonably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compelling, especially if you are a company who, for quite some time, has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been telling the world you'll be providing CPU technology that will offer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the best performance in the industry.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Don't forget, the last sentence in the paragraph has never been true and is
<BR>
simply Intel's attempt to fend off the Anti-Trust lawywers. (And except for
<BR>
maybe, the very begining, I do mean never.) Other CPUs have always out
<BR>
performed Intel ever since RISC happened, and one can easliy argue that the
<BR>
VAX CPU also out performed the Intel CPU. And even without Apple, AMD will
<BR>
support the &quot;megahertz-myth&quot; proposition. Intel may have offered &quot;good&quot; but
<BR>
the masss rarely ever get &quot;the best.&quot;
<BR>
<P>You'll notice that even in the defense -- the fact that Alpha was already
<BR>
at the point where Intel could never hope to get is not mentioned; that
<BR>
Alpha was 2-3 years ahead of Itanium performance with the gap widening. 
<BR>
(Although the way some Classic Compaq folks explained the decision to drop
<BR>
Alpha  -- the IA64 would have had performance which surpassed the Alpha by
<BR>
2004, so why should we bother to compete.)
<BR>
<P>The difference between a CICS and a RISC instruction set is significant.
<BR>
Compilers can &quot;deal with it,&quot; and no doubt will. BUT the argument between
<BR>
CICS and RISC all along has been we're faster than you are... and RISC won.
<BR>
<P>The dominant reason for dropping the port of Tru64 to IA64 years ago was
<BR>
that the port ran faster on the IA64 emulator running on the Alpha than
<BR>
it did on IA64 silicon -- so why bother.
<BR>
<P>No, I think that you will see an IA64 that simply looks like the existing
<BR>
IA64 designs -- but with compilers that can fix the branch prediction that
<BR>
the hardware can't do, and maybe the lock-step instructions that Tandem
<BR>
needs which should have been in EV7 (they haven't been mentioned that I've
<BR>
seen.)  
<BR>
<P>So, will Itanium really be &quot;Alpha inside?&quot; Or will it continue to be &quot;PARC
<BR>
inside?&quot; The philosophy between the two is very different, and compilers
<BR>
can't change that. Is Intel willing to admit that they &quot;screwed up&quot; and
<BR>
start over? Or will they simply try to &quot;fix&quot; what is an inherently flawed
<BR>
design. Sadly, history teaches us that it will be the latter.
<BR>
<P>Until Intel makes a presentation on the future, we will have zero idea what
<BR>
that future looks like on the inside. &quot;We&quot; (the Encomapass aka DECUS - UNIX
<BR>
TAG - Techincal Advisory Group aka Unix Sig) have asked Q to ask Intel to
<BR>
come talk to us at CETS2001 in Ananheim next month. Maybe they will --
<BR>
However, I don't think they will, I think we'll just get Compaq telling us
<BR>
what their vision of the future is, just like the slides from the Inquirer.
<BR>
(The session planner is due to come up today, so we'll see if anything can
<BR>
be determined from the session list.)
<BR>
<P>I'm still afraid that Intel simply got rid of a very nasty competitor.
