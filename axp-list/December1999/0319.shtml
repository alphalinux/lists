<EM>&gt; I just recently read a message someone posted here with a similar system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from an Ebay auction where a friend of his who apparently was an ex-DEC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hardware tech. found a loose solder connection on his motherboard and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fixed it for him.  If that person is still here on the list, could you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perhaps post any more details?
</EM><BR>
<P>This was probably me...
<BR>
<P>The symptoms of my PC164 (which I bought new from Vobis for ~4500$, not
<BR>
from daved) where just random. I had everything from spontaneus reboots
<BR>
to lockups which didn't go away even after power off and on again, to
<BR>
CIA machine chacks to endlessly scrolling numbers on the screen and
<BR>
some more quirks.
<BR>
<P>I replaced battery, ram, gfx-card, scsi-card, nic, power-supply, hd,
<BR>
floppy,... and it seemed to fix the problem every time i changed
<BR>
something, but now i know it was just because i was touching the
<BR>
mainboard and the bad contact moved a little bit and made it work
<BR>
for a while. but from heat expansion and vibration it would
<BR>
eventually loose contact again.
<BR>
<P>the bad contact was on U14, near U12.
<BR>
<P><P>i also bought 2 SX164 from daved@sysmerica.com. one of them just didn't
<BR>
work, so i sent it back and he replaced it with no problems. i don't
<BR>
know what exactly was wrong with it.
<BR>
<P>the other trouble i had with the sx was memory. they are really picky
<BR>
about mem. my friendly dealer replaced them twice with different
<BR>
brands. the were all PC100 DIMMS, but either some RAM-Manufacturers
<BR>
don't respect the Specs or the the SX164 needs something better
<BR>
than PC100 (there's a compatibility list somewhere on the dec-site,
<BR>
but it was of no use to me, because no dealer i contacted could
<BR>
find any of those DIMMs...
<BR>
<P><P>i must say, i had quite some troubles with those alphas, but now
<BR>
that they finally work, i really like them :)
<BR>
<P>Bye
