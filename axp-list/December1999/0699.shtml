An update on this install.  It is running but veeerrryyyy slowly.  I thought it had
<BR>
stopped, but it was only going slowly.  So far a complete install has taken 11
<BR>
hours, with an estimated 147 hours to go.  This is just one hop on a local network
<BR>
with 10Mbit Ethernet.  Something is obviously not working, but how to determine
<BR>
what?
<BR>
<P>Thanks.  Sven

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This doesn't help much but at least you know there is *one* way which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has worked well anyway. I didn't use  a custom install since I had it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; choke on me about 10 times for redhat 6.0 on x86. I successfully updated to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RedHat 6.1 on a DS10 with only an IDE HD and CDROM  (1 HD so no raid) by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; burning the 6.1-alpha.iso myself and booting it using the SRM console. I bought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the DS10 from Compaq under their recent Linux ready online  deal so it already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had Redhat 6.0 installed. The update went very smoothly even though I had all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sorts of rawhide+6.0 combinations. The update didn't update only those RPM from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 6.0 but all RPM's apparently (no custom update selected). Since I routinely boot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into 2.3.x kernels and use ipnatctl and iptables facility for IP masquerading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and filtering it was nice the update didn't touch those 2.3.x facilities.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As an aside, I booted NetBSD 1.4.2 and ran it diskless on the DS10 today
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so all you need is some machine that supports bootp,tftp and nfs and an a hour
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or so of adjusting config files. In my case it took longer but I'm stupid. e.g.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the DS10 console manual said ew*0_mode = fast is fast SCSI so I took that to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mean it had nothing to do with wanting to use 100BaseTX which my NFS server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; uses and its dhcpd wasn't in a talking mood last night. The basic fileset to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boot multiuser to a console is about 16MB gzipped if your bandwidth doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allow 650MB downloads.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hey, just a suggestion, no wizzy redhat logos but it works :-)
