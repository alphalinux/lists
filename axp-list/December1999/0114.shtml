Yes, Dell sells Alphas.  Dell resells Network Appliance boxes. Initially
<BR>
they sold a board and box I know rather well based upon EV5.6, and in a
<BR>
PICMG box with
<BR>
10 PCI slots, also manufactured by Digital.  Then they designed their own
<BR>
21164A
<BR>
board with just the things they needed on it and also designed the very
<BR>
clever
<BR>
enclosure with hot plug fans and, as I recall, power supplies.  They were
<BR>
well along with a successor about which I can't speak.  But Network
<BR>
Appliance has my unqualified respect, not just for being a &quot;leading edge&quot;
<BR>
company, but defining the leading edge (as SGI once did).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Netapp architects could, and perhaps will some day write the book on
<BR>
optimal use of the superpipelined processor, and another on cache
<BR>
utilization.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they didn't just build &quot;fast&quot;.  Their market is on the edges of the
<BR>
&quot;non-stop&quot; sector.  Banks and corporate web sites like Amazon need very
<BR>
robust systems.   Too bad Compaq didn't have the wisdom to partner with, or
<BR>
buy Netapp.  They had the chance.  Dell had the chance and is a partner.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no idea how Dell is doing with the product.  It wasn't their
<BR>
market in the past, but is where several PC companies want to go, including
<BR>
Compaq.  I know that no file server product in the industry touches Netapp
<BR>
for latency.   It takes 2 to 10 times the number of processors for a
<BR>
Sparcserver to provide equivalent aggregate bandwidth, and Netapp is only
<BR>
using 21164As at 600 Mhz on their current high end.  I wonder a little where
<BR>
a next generation Alpha product is, but that is no longer my business.
<BR>
Remaining the leader using a 4 year old processor is a testimonial to both
<BR>
the Alpha, and Network Appliance's software architecture.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I havn't looked at their book value lately, but it can't be long before
<BR>
Netapp might be able to purchase Compaq - should they want to.   And no, I
<BR>
don't work for Network Appliance, or, any longer, for Digital/Compaq.  This
<BR>
is an Alpha conference, and I sometimes can't resist sharing first-hand
<BR>
experience of potential for Alpha in performance driven markets.  Some
<BR>
superb engineering was not properly marketed, but that doesn't make it less
<BR>
impressive an achievement.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Netapp has created their own &quot;kernel&quot; (see their web site).  They must
<BR>
be
<BR>
watching carefully the rumors around the end of support for Alpha (and I
<BR>
note that you have to look hard to find direct mention of Alpha on
<BR>
www.netapp.com).  With Tandem moving to Alpha, I believe they may have
<BR>
little to fear.  And I would love to see what they do with hardware support
<BR>
for threads (as described in the MicroProcessor Report), perhaps coming in
<BR>
some future Alpha.  The biggest advantage future Alpha processors have is
<BR>
memory and I/O bandwidth. The Alpha crossbar architecture is some years
<BR>
ahead of anything from Intel.  Future Alpha
<BR>
processors will become nodes in a switching matrix, if the line continues.
