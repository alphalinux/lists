<P>
<EM>&gt; After booting off of the CD (the system doesn't like the floppies) I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; started the install, went through fdisk partitioning (BSD style -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; including making sure that fdisk didn't extend any of the partitions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; past the end of the disk) and got to the screen that assigns filesystems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to partitions.  After I assigned swap, /, /usr and /home to where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I wanted them to go on sdb I tried to exit from the screen and got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a message  that said that the partition table on sda was corrupt did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I want to fix it or skip it.  I selected skip to avoid trashing the VMS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; install and was rewarded by a message about signal 11 followed by another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one about now being a good time to restart the system.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since you booted from the CD you used the original ramdisk which seems
<BR>
prone to Sig11 problems, usually when selecting packages, but this could
<BR>
be another problem with it. You mention the system doesn't like floppies,
<BR>
could it at least you one as a ramdisk floppy? then you could use the
<BR>
updated image from <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/errata">http://www.redhat.com/errata</A>
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I finally was able to install RedHat by pulling the VMS drive (hot swap
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drives ARE nice), installing on the IBM drive (now, sda), modifying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aboot.conf and fstab (sda-&gt;sdb), putting the VMS drive back in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system and rebooting.  Everything seems to work now except that aboot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; claims the boot device is /dev/sda2.  Is the aboot boot_device anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to worry about?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is RH6 installers inability to deal with a non-bsd/non-windows disk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a known problem?  Or did I make a basic error somewhere?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One last question: Is there anything I can/should do to use a LK411
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keyboard with Linux/Xfree86?  It seems to work but at 3AM I'm not sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would have noticed much.
</EM><BR>
<P>Don't know, what's different about a LK411 keyboard?
