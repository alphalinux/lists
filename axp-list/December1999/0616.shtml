<P>
I have a sort of general RPM question that I was wondering about.
<BR>
<P>What is usually the best method to do updates per say?  For instance, the
<BR>
other day I was compiling FreeAMP, and it said I needed a newer version of
<BR>
GTK, so I slid on over to RH website and pulled down a an updated RPM pack.
<BR>
I then proceeded to try to install them with a command like:
<BR>
<P>rpm -U XXXXXX.rpm (don't remember the file name)
<BR>
<P>and it basically told me that there were dependencies on another package, so
<BR>
I couldn't upgrade.  When I downloaded and tried to upgrade that other, it
<BR>
basically told me it was dependant on that original one I was trying to
<BR>
upgrade (circular references it appears).
<BR>
<P>Now what is the sort of accepted way to do updates like this?  I ended up
<BR>
finding a switch to ignore dependencies, but that crap could come back to
<BR>
haunt me one of these days since they are usually there to keep me from
<BR>
doing something stupid.
<BR>
<P>Any suggestions/tips that could help an aspiring (hehe) Linux newbie?
<BR>
