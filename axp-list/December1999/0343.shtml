<P>
I have a melanin challenged Alphaserver 800 (a Digital Server 3305) with
<BR>
two scsi drives (1 4.1GB Seagate (DKA0 or /dev/sda) and 1 4.3GB IBM
<BR>
(DKA200 or /dev/sdb)).
<BR>
VMS is installed on DKA0 and I have now installed RedHat 6 on DKA200.
<BR>
<P>After booting off of the CD (the system doesn't like the floppies) I
<BR>
started the install, went through fdisk partitioning (BSD style -
<BR>
including making sure that fdisk didn't extend any of the partitions
<BR>
past the end of the disk) and got to the screen that assigns filesystems
<BR>
to partitions.  After I assigned swap, /, /usr and /home to where
<BR>
I wanted them to go on sdb I tried to exit from the screen and got
<BR>
a message  that said that the partition table on sda was corrupt did
<BR>
I want to fix it or skip it.  I selected skip to avoid trashing the VMS
<BR>
install and was rewarded by a message about signal 11 followed by another
<BR>
one about now being a good time to restart the system.
<BR>
<P>I finally was able to install RedHat by pulling the VMS drive (hot swap
<BR>
drives ARE nice), installing on the IBM drive (now, sda), modifying
<BR>
aboot.conf and fstab (sda-&gt;sdb), putting the VMS drive back in the
<BR>
system and rebooting.  Everything seems to work now except that aboot
<BR>
claims the boot device is /dev/sda2.  Is the aboot boot_device anything
<BR>
to worry about?
<BR>
<P>Is RH6 installers inability to deal with a non-bsd/non-windows disk
<BR>
a known problem?  Or did I make a basic error somewhere?
<BR>
<P>One last question: Is there anything I can/should do to use a LK411
<BR>
keyboard with Linux/Xfree86?  It seems to work but at 3AM I'm not sure
<BR>
I would have noticed much.
