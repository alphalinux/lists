<EM>&gt; &gt; 1: The new PIII (copperbug) does run faster (and show a lot better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    SPECint and SPECfp), but when translated to realworld applications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    (atleast ours) the difference isn´t that significant (since we can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    get a hold of Intels internal compiler among other things).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hummm . . . So again, if code is developed with the Alpha in mind, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; application will be faster than the same application coded specifically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the Intel.  OK . . . .
</EM><BR>
<P>Usually, the compilers make a big difference, if you're benchmarking an
<BR>
application be sure to check out the Compaq Tru64 Compilers that are being
<BR>
ported over to Linux. In certain cases these can have a large effect on
<BR>
performance (the compilers and the libraries together).
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 6: Limited memory bandwith on Intel hardware (at least compared to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    Alphas)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is this the 32-bit -vs- 64-bit architecture argument?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, this is memory bandwidth of the chipset. If you look at something like
<BR>
a DP264 (DS20) it has a theoretical memory bandwidth of 5.2Gig/second
<BR>
(accross 2 memory buses), I don't think Intel has anything close to that.
<BR>
It's more a function of the memory bus being 256Bits wide.
<BR>

<EM>&gt; &gt; 7: Development on Alphas slumped after the takeover since Compaq
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    wanted to rebrand the machines(had to go back to the FCC for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    testing, affected the XP1000, DS-20, DS-10, DS-40 to my knowhow),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    something that was a totaly braindead idea.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree with this one.  I thought Alpha took a header for a short while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because of the Compaq deal.
</EM><BR>
<P>As with any large takeover I'm sure there were (and probably still are)
<BR>
problems in there.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 8: Alphas have advanced quite extensivly since the takeover with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    Proc´s (EV6, EV67 and the upcoming EV68) and tech (wildfire), this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    coupled with the API push downward (price and spec´s).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; EV68, huh?  I'll have to look into this one.
</EM><BR>
<P>EV68 is the next series of the EV6 processor. EV6 was build at .35
<BR>
microns, EV67 is .25 and EV68 should be .18 (if I remember everything
<BR>
correctly)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 9: Performance has more or less stayed the same since 86 with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    Alpha being about 2x to Intel on real performance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Real meaning what type of applications?  Fp intensive as stated above or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something else?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 10: It´s kewler to use Alphas(anything else is just beta anyway).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Can't argue with this one!  :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Besides, nothing beats the look in people's eyes when you tell them you
<BR>
run an Alpha at home :)
