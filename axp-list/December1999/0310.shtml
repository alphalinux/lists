<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I suspect that is an answer to the question I've just been asking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; myself... how hard and fast is the 30-day deadline?  I've had mine about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 38 days; didn't get a power supply until a week ago, grrrr.
</EM><BR>
<P>I really don't know.  You would have to call them and ask.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For the record, it would appear mine was jumpered to a 10x CPU multiplier
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (IRQ 2, which seems to be a default looking at the manual, and should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 11x but evidentally isn't). The clock crystal was a 36.6 MHz one, so I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; currently running at 366MHz.  There was a full pack of crystals, though,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so I was going to probably go up to 10x 50MHz = 500MHz when I got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything working.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm going to be more careful the next time I buy something on eBay.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>For the most part I was very pleased with the things I purchased from
<BR>
him, I mean $250 for a 500Mhz ev56 seems like a pretty good deal to me. 
<BR>
But it certainly was not &quot;ready to use&quot; out of the box.  I had to do
<BR>
some reading before getting started.  But once configured everything was
<BR>
fine.  Also try getting it to work at the rated speed, I have had bad
<BR>
luck under clocking alphas before.
