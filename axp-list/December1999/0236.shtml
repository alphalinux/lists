Okay. After lurking way in advance, I finally got a copy of RH 6 for alpha
<BR>
and I've been having some problems. First of all, I was wondering if there
<BR>
was a decent installation guide. Second, I thought I'd share my problems:
<BR>
<P>1.	When I install any additional packages, I get 'failed to create
<BR>
keyboard configuration: no such file or directory'
<BR>
2.	After installing without any extras, it reboots, goes straight to a
<BR>
MILO that gives me xx seconds to do whatever, after which, it looks for
<BR>
something on the floppy which it doesn't find, so I end up with the milo
<BR>
prompt.
<BR>
<P>After I didn't know what to put at the milo prompt, I thought I'd check
<BR>
things out from NT, and my NT kernel was corrupt. At that point, I had to go
<BR>
to work, so I didn't have time to mess with it. But I thought I'd regroup
<BR>
here before the next battle.
