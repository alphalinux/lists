<EM>&gt; Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD are all fine, stable OSi.
</EM><BR>
<P>To sum up, from a Slashdot post and personal experience:
<BR>
<P>Linux: jack of all trades.  Supports a lot of hardware, does a lot of
<BR>
things, many (but not all) of them well.  The Leatherman of OS's. 
<BR>
<P>NetBSD: runs on anything in the way of old, scary hardware.  For that old
<BR>
machine you always thought you could use, but didn't have an OS for. 
<BR>
<P>FreeBSD: stable, fast, runs on i386 and ??? Other ports exist but I'm not
<BR>
sure of their status.
<BR>
<P>OpenBSD:  Paranoid about security or need a good firewall?  Run OpenBSD. 
<BR>
You don't have to work hard to make it really secure. 
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;From my experience, the *BSD's have a smaller and tidier default install. 
</EM><BR>
You can add more packages if you want, but you don't get everything and
<BR>
the kitchen sink whether you like it or not.  And if you need to hack
<BR>
around under the surface (i.e., edit init scripts, etc.) it's pretty
<BR>
straightforward and standard, both internally and between *BSD variants.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OTOH, Linux distros have a lot more tools and goodies by default
<BR>
in case you need to roll a solution to a special problem.  And it's nice
<BR>
sometimes to just select a high-level wad of packages and say &quot;install&quot;,
<BR>
rather than use /usr/ports on *BSD.
<BR>
<P><P>Of course, I haven't used all of these as much as some peope have, so jump
<BR>
in if you have more/better info.
