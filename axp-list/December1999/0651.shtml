<P>
I've got a basic AlphaServer 4000 (5/300 2M CPU, 256M RAM) that I'm trying
<BR>
to install Linux on. I've had no end of machine check problems, but I know
<BR>
the hardware is fine since it ran Windows NT for nearly three years without
<BR>
a problem.
<BR>
<P>I've got the machine torn down to the simplest possible configuration: there
<BR>
are only two cards in the slots (Number Nine 764 video that came with the
<BR>
machine, and a 3Com 3C590 10/100 Ethernet card (I've also tried the DE500-AA
<BR>
that came with the machine)). There are two devices on the internal NCR
<BR>
53c810 SCSI host adapter: the DEC supplied CD-ROM, and a 4G Western Digital
<BR>
SCSI hard drive. That's it.
<BR>
<P>I've gotten RH 6.0 installed, and the machine is very stable as long I don't
<BR>
perform any significant network accesses. As a test, I loaded up all the 6.0
<BR>
SRPMS, and started a complete rebuild. Two days later the machine was still
<BR>
cranking along, so I'm pretty sure the core hardware and the SCSI hard drive
<BR>
are just fine. However, I can't get network access to work reliably at all.
<BR>
I've tried both the 3C590 and the DE500 in PCI buses 0 and 1, tried using
<BR>
&quot;SRM PCI Setup&quot; and not using it... I'm using kernel 2.2.13 configured for a
<BR>
Rawhide (not generic).
<BR>
<P>Most of the time, the machine will boot up just fine, then I can log in and
<BR>
do whatever I want. Regardless if it's been up for two minutes or two hours,
<BR>
though, if I try any significant network activity (FTP large files, or copy
<BR>
a directory over from an NFS mount), the system will machine check.
<BR>
<P>Anyone have any ideas for additional troubleshooting? I know there are
<BR>
people running these systems with Linux out there and they work just fine...
<BR>
but mine's being irritable. Thanks in advance.
<BR>
