<P>
Well, Sun's making noise about releasing a Linux version of the Java 1.2.2 JDK.
<BR>
Of course, the implicit assumption is that Linux == Linux/Intel.
<BR>
<P>FWIW, they have a comment email address at:  j2se-linux-comments@sun.com
<BR>
If anyone else would be as interested as I am in seeing some official support
<BR>
for Java on Linux/Alpha, that address might interest you.
<BR>
<P><P>For now, Uncle George's excellent JDK 1.1.8 port is serving me quite well
<BR>
(pun intended -- it's running Apache JServ :), but due to the difficulties
<BR>
he's had with licensing and so forth, my understanding is he won't be able
<BR>
to continue that port, so we need a different solution.
<BR>
<P>We can ask Sun for a Linux/Alpha port, but honestly I doubt it'll happen;
<BR>
porting to a 64-bit architecture is, like, WORK;  if we see anything it'll
<BR>
probably be PowerPC or SPARC or one of the other 32-bit blackdown ports.
<BR>
<P>So, maybe we can cajole Compaq into it. :)  The SCSL is relatively liberal
<BR>
(for a business license) and I'm sure Compaq could get a redistribution
<BR>
license from Sun with minimal pain.  If Compaq's serious about Linux as
<BR>
driving Alpha sales, they need a Java port.
<BR>
<P>I don't miss Shockwave and all that, and Mozilla's looking pretty decent, but
<BR>
I can't live without Java. :( It doesn't have to be incredibly fast, but it
<BR>
does have to exist.  (But what happened to the guy I talked to at JavaOne who
<BR>
was touting the 64-bit Java on Tru64?  Let's get that ported!! :)
<BR>
<P><P><P>Does anyone know if Compaq's got any plans for something like this, or is
<BR>
there someone we can make a request to?
