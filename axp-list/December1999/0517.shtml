<P>Yes, I got that as well.  But remember, you got the Tru64 as a part of a
<BR>
&quot;hobbyist&quot; program, and VMS has one as well.  That's likely the reason you
<BR>
got both.
<BR>
<P>Of course, I don't mind, as I make my living with VMS, and run it on more
<BR>
systems here at home than anything else...UNIX and Linux are more of a
<BR>
curiosity to me, and I only use Windows 'cause I have a gun held to my
<BR>
head...&lt;grin&gt;...
