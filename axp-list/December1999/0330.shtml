Hello,
<BR>
<P>I have successfully put RH6.0 on the AlphaStation, however, there are a few
<BR>
glitches.  The Alpha Installation Addendum suggests that systems that
<BR>
support MILO (such as mine) have ARC but mine seems to come with SRM
<BR>
instead, as I don't see any boot menu on startup, only the &gt;&gt;&gt; prompt.
<BR>
<P>Still, it seemed that MILO was the way to go, so I tried it. Plus, I did
<BR>
not find the SRM-specific avanti-s.img mentioned in the manual. Here is the
<BR>
story:
<BR>
<P>1. The avanti.img or xl.img from RedHat (milo/images) did not boot (invalid
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boot block). I had to grab an image from gatekeeper.dec.com.
<BR>
<P>2. MILO did not recognize all the memory (288 MB). This is easy to fix at
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the MILO prompt but I have not found a way to set it permanently in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;milo.conf. Adding append &quot;mem=288M&quot; causes the kernel to hang.
<BR>
<P>3. MILO would not boot from its hard disk partition (type DOS), I guess SRM
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot read that.
<BR>
<P>So it seems that MILO is nice but not really useful for me, unless I want
<BR>
to always boot from a floppy. OK, forget about MILO. I have to use aboot and
<BR>
reformat the hard drive with BSD labels. But
<BR>
<P>4. fdisk -b behaved funny and never got the partitions right. I saw another
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mailing about that behavior today which helped me believe it is not just
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my problem. How do people do this?
<BR>
<P>I would appreciate any comments. Thanks.
<BR>
<P>Petr
