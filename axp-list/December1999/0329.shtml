<P>
There have been some good replies referencing tools such as 'cp', which is
<BR>
fine if you can/don't mind putting the drive from the new system into
<BR>
another system (or vice versa).
<BR>
<P>However, I thought I'd mention another idea, which is relevant if you have a
<BR>
copy of NT4 Workstation or Server lying around.  We wrote a *free* utility
<BR>
called &quot;Stand Alone Disaster Recovery&quot; which was written to allow NT users
<BR>
to backup or restore an entire physical drive.  Although based on NT and
<BR>
written for NT, it will happily backup non-NT systems (and any type of FS).
<BR>
What the tool does is allow you to create a set of 3 bootable floppies (5
<BR>
floppies for Alpha systems), using files mostly from the NT CD.  If you have
<BR>
the smarts, you can burn a CD with these files on them (just make sure that
<BR>
the files on the floppies exist in the \ALPHA directory on the CD).  When
<BR>
the program is invoked, you can backup from one physical drive to another,
<BR>
-OR- you can backup/restore the entire physical drive to a tape drive (most
<BR>
are supported, although spanning is not supported so it must all fit on one
<BR>
tape).  It is a 68KB download from our website, just click on &quot;download&quot;.

Subject: Installing five identical systems...
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am about to install RedHat Linux together with Digital Unix
<BR>
on five identical DP264 machines. Now I have done setup on one machine, and 
<BR>
am wondering if there is any tool that can just &quot;duplicate&quot; the existing
<BR>
partition/data on the current system disk to the rest four new disks so as 
<BR>
to prevent from re-installation &quot;from scratch&quot;. This way I can just plug the
<BR>
copied system disk into another machine, boot from it and change the 
<BR>
configurations since the hardware setting on these five machines are all the
<BR>
same. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe such tools exist, or how can those system vendors bear
<BR>
doing the same job for one hundred times to install the 128-node cluster?
<BR>
