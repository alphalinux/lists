<P>
I just got RH6.1 going on my Multia and have been going crazy trying to 
<BR>
figure out how to enable support for PCMCIA.  BTW, what a pain in the a*s 
<BR>
working around all the RH installer problems.  (Had to boot in single-user 
<BR>
mode to create a /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/network file containing a 
<BR>
value for hostname, plus had to manually paste the encrypted password in 
<BR>
/etc/passwd from a regular user account to the root password since the 
<BR>
installer decided to leave it blank - passwd wouldn't set it either).  I'm 
<BR>
still getting a bunch of &quot;Unary expected&quot; errors in a bunch of the 
<BR>
initscripts (I thought the new version of initscripts - 4.70 - was suppossed 
<BR>
to fix these problems?).  Anyway, back to the matter at hand, since I can 
<BR>
still boot past those errors, I am more concerned with getting PCMCIA going 
<BR>
so I can get the Multia going as the server for my LAN instead of a client 
<BR>
:)  I have a possibly unsupported card (New Media Livewire 10/100).  It's 
<BR>
not the Livewire+ which is definitely unsupported, but it's not listed as 
<BR>
supported either, potluck I guess.  Any help is greatly appreciated (I'm 
<BR>
sure this is an easy one, I'm just not looking in the right place).
<BR>
