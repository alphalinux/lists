<P>
Thanx for the great info.  I have, in fact, ordered additional cache (and
<BR>
the battery back-up to allow write-back) so I'm hoping to get decent
<BR>
performance.  I will post some info as I put it together if anyone cares.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had really hoped to have RH 6.1 by now, but it's still an
<BR>
&quot;unknown ship date&quot; as of this writing.  My understanding is that there are
<BR>
a few final issues with SCSI but the rest of the dist is ready to go.
<BR>
Still, I find it a bit odd (and somewhat disturbing) that I cannot even get
<BR>
a BETA copy at this point. (I did get a BETA of SuSE 6.3 but have not had
<BR>
the time to figure out how to get it to allow me to load with fdisk.
<BR>
Install tools look very good however - you can do a lot on the front end)
<BR>

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even the &quot;Smart&quot; Array 3200 is little more than a Compaq OEM 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the DAC960
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; PG with 2.x class firmware.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is for this reason that many consultants like myself may 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be tempted to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; flash the EEPROM up to a higher Mylex &quot;retail&quot; version when there is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; second EEPROM seated in the second EEPROM chip seat.  Of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; course, this will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; end your warranty when done, though in certain very specific 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circumstances
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (or when you are at the end of your warranty), this can get 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you support for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 18.2, 24 and even 36 GB drive capacities that you may require.  Of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; course, remember the old water cooler anaology when building 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RAID arrays:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the more spigots you have on your water cooler the faster you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can drain (or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fill) the water cooler.  Having a REALLY LARGE water cooler 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with only a few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spigots gets you a high capacity per cm but not much in the way of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; read/write performance.  Somewhere in the middle is the right
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; price/performance/capacity which can vary wildly with system 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or applicaiton
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; requirements.  It is still preferable to build an array with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 9GB building
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blocks (particularly the newer IBM Enterprise or Seagate 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Cheetah 2 drives). 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As a simple example, I have found that for large sequential 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; read/write and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; random uncached read/write, the fastest RAID level by far is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RAID &quot;6&quot; (in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mylex speak), also called RAID level 0/1 by the RAB (RAID 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Advisory Board).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  RAID level 0/1, sometimes called RAID &quot;10&quot; is the RAID level 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in which you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have two identical RAID 0 stripped arrays (consisting of two 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or more drives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; per RAID level 0 array), which is by definition a &quot;mirrored 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stripe set&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which is very different from a stripped mirror (you can 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; research this at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the RAB, if you wish).  At this RAID level, you do not use parity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information which means there is no real performance hit when 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a drive is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lost since parity isn't being used to generate missing data 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and there is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ENTIRE copy of the data stripped across the other array.  The 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effect of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RAID 10 is high performance through multiplexing two RAID 0 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arrays (RAID 0
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has a high read/write performance due to stripped data across multiple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disks with no parity generation overhead).  A properly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; configured RAID 10
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can be as much as 50% faster than a RAID 0 array of the same 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; size, though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you need twice as many disks to achieve the same capacity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Large stripe block sizes (say 128 KB) produce the best sequential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; read/write performance by &quot;chunking&quot; more data per write (and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; therefore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fewer transactions are required) while smaller stripe blocks 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (say 8KB) are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ideal for random access to such things as databases.  I turn 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; write-back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cache ON on the controller in all installations since the UPS that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installed is always more than enough for a 15 minute run, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more than long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough to shutdown the system and commit to disk.  I don't 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bother stuffing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more than about 32MB of memory (which is pretty cheap these 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; days) since the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; performance difference between 8 MB of cache and 32 MB in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most cases is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; less than 6%.   
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Where sequential read/write of large files is the design for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the RAID, use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; read-ahead caching.  Most new RAID controllers have Adaptive cache
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; configurations in which the cache can reconfigure itself into several
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; smaller caches in order to take better advantage of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; available cache for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; smaller more random traffic.  I am also pretty hellbent on 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; getting even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more performance by ENABLING the write cache on the drives 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; themselves.  By
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; default, most hard drives ship with their mode pages for write cache
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DISABLED to make them &quot;safer.&quot;  If you are using a newer drive with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; large, smart cache, take advantage of it in the the critical 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; area of write
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; performance and turn them on.  Note you will see NO 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; performance increase in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; situations where the ratio of read to write time is greater 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than 75% (which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is most of the time) but you will see a slight (5%) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difference if your RAID
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spends most of its time being hit by a steady stream of write 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; requests (say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in log generation for a database with a long sequential stream of data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; writes).  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; StorageWorks kits with a duplexer (adds channels to the stock 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; backplane)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can produce the ideal result though you may be able to buy a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; less expensive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unit from the industrial computing market with similar or even greater
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capacity.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Good luck,
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;	Per Compaq's docs and config tools, the Mylex 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; controllers will not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;support drives in excess of 9GB - in other words, Compaq 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will not sell 36GB
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;drives spec'd into a system with the Myles RAID controllers. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I'm trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;set up RAID using 36GB drives and was wondering why they are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not supported
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;by Compaq on that controller.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;	This is the only viable solution I can use, as we are a Compaq
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;reseller and need to demo a &quot;fully supported&quot; config that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can be ordered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;direct.
</EM><BR>
