<P>
<EM>&gt; Microsoft put out more iterations of Windows than Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Win3.1,Win95,Win98,WinNT, Win2000 etc...). Does that make it better?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (I know, if you count the distributions, maybe Linux puts out more, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you get the point?).
</EM><BR>
<P>That's not what I'm saying.  What I mean to say is that it is the only
<BR>
thing I see as definitive at the moment.  Actually, I like Linux and xBSD
<BR>
based open source systems.  That's all I run at home, besides a MAC.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Then ask for it. Usually the way to get information out of people is to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ask, not to offend them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hummm . . . I did not know that making a non-alpha partisan statement
<BR>
would be offensive.  I guess I was mistaken.  I apologize.  I simply
<BR>
seek information.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That depends. what are you planning on doing with these systems? Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; excels at fp (the SX was a cheaper design and that point was actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the previous poster, who was interested in the axpPCI33), if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work you are doing involves floating point math then yes, you could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably get a higher price/performance then Intel. If you're planning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on selling these machine to home users that use them for web surfing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and word processing, go with Intel, or AMD. The home user will probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be happy with the Celeron.
</EM><BR>
<P>I was thinking of a small 2 or 4 node Beowulf cluster like the ones at
<BR>
NASA.  It would be for experimentation.  Fp would be important.
<BR>
<P>You're right about the Celeron.  That would be plenty of CPU for most
<BR>
Internet and business users.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I picked up my SX164 (that's a 533MHz 21164PC) for $250, what's the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going price of a PIII-700 and motherboard?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure but I bet it's more that $250.00 including CPU!  :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You may want to look at the information on the alphalinux.org site
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the EV8 cpus and where Compaq is taking the Alpha. (news article
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; several sections down). I think there is also a presentation on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; EV7 on the old Compaq OEM site.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's what I needed.  Thanks!
