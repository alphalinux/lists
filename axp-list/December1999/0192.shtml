<P>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps you can share with us Compaq's R&amp;D budget over the past few years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so that we can see how this has dropped? Or perhaps some data on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; number of employees working on Alpha? and I suppose you've taken into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; account the other companies working on Alpha also (Samsung, API)?
</EM><BR>
<P>I have none.  I was only looking at this based on partisan announcements
<BR>
from the EOMs.  It seems that Intel puts out more iterations of is
<BR>
processors than does Compaq.  Also, I was looking to spur arguments so I
<BR>
can understand why Alpha over Intel.  Can you give such definitive
<BR>
information?  It would be greatly appreciated!  :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; This is allowing Intel to catchup and surpass Alphas based on on CPU
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; speed and price (i.e. bang-for-the-buck).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Please, opinions are one thing, but this is just flame bait.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are correct.  Guilty as charged.  As stated above, I need information
<BR>
and the people on this list probably have what I need.  Again, can you
<BR>
help?  Why Alpha?  Arguments based on Processor, subsystems, etc.
<BR>
architecture are good.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; On another note, I'd also reccomend looking for the SX machines, or even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some PC164 machines (just saw some PC164-433 motherboards on ebay). The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; performance is much greater than the old axpPCI33.
</EM><BR>
<P>SX based systems, huh?  I guess they can give the price/performance break
<BR>
that the newer Intel's can?
