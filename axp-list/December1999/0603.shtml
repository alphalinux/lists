<EM>&gt; &gt; Hmmm.... I don't know what &quot;older&quot; hardware would

<EM>&gt; &gt; be... but I know I use to get OpenBSD to kernel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; panic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on me if I mounted a floppy disk.... or the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keyboard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would lock up. I would think floppy controllers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; keyboards are pretty old stuff.... I think it was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; OpenBSD 2.4... from our experiences, we concluded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; OpenBSD was pretty unstable.... or at least gave
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the most problems among all the *BSDs and Linux.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Did you report the bug to the OpenBSD team?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Paul
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, yes... and the response we got was, &quot;oh
<BR>
yeah, we've been getting the same reports from other
<BR>
users... you need to recompile the kernel with ...
<BR>
(details forgotten).. but you'll need a running
<BR>
OpenBSD system.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Well, at that point, we couldn't even get it to
<BR>
install 'cause the keyboard would lockup during the
<BR>
boot process. We eventually did it the hard way,
<BR>
installed an older OpenBSD, rebuilt a new kernel, and
<BR>
reinstalled the new OpenBSD.
<BR>
<P>That was only one of the many problems we had,... and
<BR>
the one that really confused us was kernel panics when
<BR>
we tried to mount a floppy. It didn't happen all the
<BR>
time, but enough times that it was frustrating.
<BR>
<P>Anyways.. this is off-topic... 
<BR>
<P>D.
