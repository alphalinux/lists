<P><EM>&gt; Hi,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have a AlphaPC 164 (bought off e-bay from sysmerica, like several others on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this topic.) However, mine came with ARC, not AlphaBios (or are they the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing?). I have switched many times between ARC and SRM while trying different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installations and hardware (this is my first Alpha and has become my hobby...)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps you can go from AlphaBios-&gt;ARC-&gt;SRM. 
</EM><BR>
<P>AlphaBIOS was the 'replacement' for ARC. I think you'll find the two are
<BR>
very similar, AlphaBIOS just looks a little prettier.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Regarding the floppy problem, I have a cable that has only one connector, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've never had a problem with either ARC or SRM. I don't remember where / when I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; got it (maybe a baby? They do seem to be breeding in my cables/rails/cut-outs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; box...) Perhaps a local dealer has them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; With respect to the CD-ROM, until Linux or NT load, ARC it sees my IDE CD-ROM as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a SCSI drive. I not real sure how the whole IDE thing works on the Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<P>Correct, IDE devices are reported as SCSI, that's normal.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think you'll still have problems, though when you get the SRM installed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unless I am mistaken, SRM doesn't support Adaptec 294x controllers. Actually, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; may be Adaptec in general. I've tried 2906, 2930CU and 2940 (not 2940U, 2940UW,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2940U2W), and the SRM hasn't recognized any of them. If you can boot from some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other device, though, I think you'll be okay (at least accroding to Win NT and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux docs / READMEs.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm....I know the later SRMs for some platofrms do support some adaptec
<BR>
controllers. I'm not sure about the PC164 though, do you know which
<BR>
version of SRM this is?
