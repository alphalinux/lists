<EM>&gt; &gt; Hummm . . . So again, if code is developed with the Alpha in mind, the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; application will be faster than the same application coded specifically 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for the Intel. OK . . . . 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not even, I have a piece of junk code which I use for testing ideas out 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rather than performance, originally developed on Intel 486. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Smith and Waterman search of Swissprot 37 database using a 277 residue 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protein sequence. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Intel Celeron 400 - 822 seconds == 9 million cell updates/sec 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha 164LX 533 - 316 seconds == 25 million cell updates/sec 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha 264EV67 667 - 164 seconds == 46 million cell updates/sec 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Looks like a pretty good win for the Alpha, even if you consider that the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Intel cost &lt; 500 quid and the Alpha 164 was 1100 it's still better value. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The 264 is less easy to justify as those systems are priced much higher, I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was quoted 8000 for an XP1000 with 667 EV67 processor. A cluster of 164 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boxes would be a better bet for our work. Even assuming you could get an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 800Mhz x86 processor now you would still be looking at a performance 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around 30% less than the 533 164 and rather shocking 60% down on a 667 264 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; box despite the apparent higher clock speed. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alphas are good, very very good. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Let's go thru the math on this. If one can buy a 400mhz Celeron 
<BR>
for 500 quid or less, and an XP1000 for 8000 quid, (which sounds high)
<BR>
then one gets at least 16 Celerons for that XP1000. 9x16=144 million 
<BR>
cell updates per second vs 46M updates. Now, I'd be curious where one 
<BR>
can purchase those 533LX's at 1100 quid. In the US, 533LX's go
<BR>
for around US$1995, approximately 1230 quid. Even so, I think one 
<BR>
could put together a Celeron for much less than 500 quid. A 400mhz 
<BR>
Celeron and motherboard go for $120. One can add a disk/case/memory 
<BR>
and have a reasonable system for less than $500. So, given US prices, 
<BR>
one can buy 4 Celerons for the price of a 533LX, 9*4=36M updates/sec 
<BR>
vs 25M on a 21164. Worst case, using your 533LX price, you still
<BR>
might be able to get 4 Celerons, depending on memory/disk you buy,
<BR>
or maybe 3 which makes the 21164 a wash vs Celeron in price/performance.
<BR>
<P>There are reasons to use Alphas.
<BR>
<P>I use them because I can't stand the space constraints of using
<BR>
that many Intels and, of course, Alphas are 64 bit and support
<BR>
large files, a necessity in my line of work. And, looking at
<BR>
bang for the buck, DS10's are the way to go, Alpha wise. When 
<BR>
the UP1000 shows up, it might give the DS10 a run for the money. 
<BR>
UP2000/DS20/XP1000 are not as cost effective for most things. 
<BR>
However, they may be cost effective for codes that need VERY high 
<BR>
memory bandwidth or for codes that can't easily be parallelized
<BR>
and you have the $$$$ to spend.
