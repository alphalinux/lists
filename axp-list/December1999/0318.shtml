Hi,
<BR>
<P>I have a AlphaPC 164 (bought off e-bay from sysmerica, like several others on
<BR>
this topic.) However, mine came with ARC, not AlphaBios (or are they the same
<BR>
thing?). I have switched many times between ARC and SRM while trying different
<BR>
installations and hardware (this is my first Alpha and has become my hobby...)
<BR>
Perhaps you can go from AlphaBios-&gt;ARC-&gt;SRM. 
<BR>
<P>Regarding the floppy problem, I have a cable that has only one connector, and
<BR>
I've never had a problem with either ARC or SRM. I don't remember where / when I
<BR>
got it (maybe a baby? They do seem to be breeding in my cables/rails/cut-outs
<BR>
box...) Perhaps a local dealer has them.
<BR>
<P>With respect to the CD-ROM, until Linux or NT load, ARC it sees my IDE CD-ROM as
<BR>
a SCSI drive. I not real sure how the whole IDE thing works on the Alpha.
<BR>
<P>I think you'll still have problems, though when you get the SRM installed.
<BR>
Unless I am mistaken, SRM doesn't support Adaptec 294x controllers. Actually, it
<BR>
may be Adaptec in general. I've tried 2906, 2930CU and 2940 (not 2940U, 2940UW,
<BR>
2940U2W), and the SRM hasn't recognized any of them. If you can boot from some
<BR>
other device, though, I think you'll be okay (at least accroding to Win NT and
<BR>
Linux docs / READMEs.)
<BR>

<EM>&gt; I recently purchased an old AlphaPC 164 motherboard and processor, and am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; having a hard time getting it running.  Specifically, I am trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; replace the AlphaBIOS with SRM and just can't get it to work.  I'm also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; having some funkiness with the built-in IDE and floppy controllers.
</EM><BR>
<P>Replacing the battery on my PC164 fixed most of my problems.  It allowed
<BR>
me to get Red Hat 6.0 installed, however when I did a &quot;du -sm .&quot; in a
<BR>
directory that was about 60MB in size, I almost immediately got continuous
<BR>
CIA Machine Check 630 errors flying across the screen.  Doing an fsck on
<BR>
reboot the machine just hung, and I'm not quite sure where to go from
<BR>
here--the memory (four 16x36 60ns simms, total of 256MB) tested out fine
<BR>
in a simm tester, and a different power supply didn't solve it.
<BR>
<P>I just recently read a message someone posted here with a similar system
<BR>
from an Ebay auction where a friend of his who apparently was an ex-DEC
<BR>
hardware tech. found a loose solder connection on his motherboard and
<BR>
fixed it for him.  If that person is still here on the list, could you
<BR>
perhaps post any more details?
<BR>
<P>Mike
