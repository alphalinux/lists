<P>
I recently purchased an old AlphaPC 164 motherboard and processor, and am
<BR>
having a hard time getting it running.  Specifically, I am trying to
<BR>
replace the AlphaBIOS with SRM and just can't get it to work.  I'm also
<BR>
having some funkiness with the built-in IDE and floppy controllers.
<BR>
<P>I know all of this has been answered on this list before, but after
<BR>
digging through the archive for an hour I haven't found solid answers to
<BR>
all of my questions.  So.... please excuse the repetition. 
<BR>
<P><P>1.  I have Tru64 UNIX here, which includes the SRM Firmware Updates CD.  I
<BR>
copied off the AlphaPC164 directory to a FAT-formatted floppy and tried
<BR>
&quot;Update Firmware&quot; in AlphaBIOS.  I get blinky lights for 3 seconds, then a
<BR>
&quot;device error&quot; without further info. 
<BR>
<P>2.  Interestingly, AlphaBIOS seems to be recognizing the floppy only if it
<BR>
is plugged into the first port on the cable; that is, the one before the
<BR>
twist.  If it is plugged into the end (after the twist) it will recognize
<BR>
it, but only as a secondary floppy.  Isn't this backwards? 
<BR>
<P>3.  I have tried running fwupdate.exe directly (&quot;Run a program: &quot; with
<BR>
either &quot;a:\fwupdate.exe&quot; or &quot;multi(0)disk(0)fdisk(0)\fwupdate.exe&quot;) and
<BR>
get the same behavior as in 1.) above.  Yes, I have tried different floppy
<BR>
drives and cables.  Yes, I have them plugged into the motherboard with the
<BR>
red wire on the 1 pin. 
<BR>
<P>4.  A Fail Safe Boot firmware update accesses the floppy drive for about
<BR>
50 seconds, with the screen blank, but nothing is different when I reboot
<BR>
after that. 
<BR>
<P>5.  With the Firmware CD in an ATAPI CD-ROM drive on the secondary IDE
<BR>
bus, I get the same behavior as with the floppy.  Tried blind, dumb
<BR>
&quot;upgrade firmware&quot; as well as permutations on &quot;run a program&quot;.  Don't have
<BR>
a spare ATAPI CD-ROM to try to make sure it's not hatred for this specific
<BR>
drive.
<BR>
<P>6.  With the Firmware CD in a SCSI CD-ROM drive attatched to an Adaptec
<BR>
2940UW SCSI controller, I get nothing (&quot;device error&quot; again I believe) 
<BR>
when I try an &quot;update firmware&quot; from the main screen.  If I try to run it
<BR>
directly (run program scsi(0)cdrom(4)fdisk(0)\alphapc164\fwupdate.exe) I
<BR>
get an &quot;Invalid image&quot; error.  Which I take to mean that the executable is
<BR>
not valid for some reason...? 
<BR>
<P>7.  Installing Windows NT from CD-ROM (with the SCSI CD-ROM) works great. 
<BR>
It dies when it can't find the floppy drive for the drivers floppy (only
<BR>
have a two connector floppy cable right now, so NT would have to look to
<BR>
drive B: I guess, which it won't do), but other than that it works fine.
<BR>
<P><P>I'm going to continue trying different permutations (ATAPI CD-ROM on the
<BR>
primary bus) and work arounds (disguise fwupdate.exe as the NT installer
<BR>
program; put fwupdate.exe on a hard drive; etc.), but I wanted to make
<BR>
sure I wasn't doing something obviously wrong.  Could the power supply
<BR>
(only 275W, from PC Power &amp; Cooling) be too weak, thus causing some subtle
<BR>
brown out, such that everything works fine except the firmware update?
<BR>
<P>Likewise, I have the green ATX soft-power wire grounded to the side of the
<BR>
power supply (both ends of the wire: PS and motherboard ends).  Should I
<BR>
instead ground it to the neighboring black ground wire?  Is this perhaps
<BR>
subtlely screwing things up?
<BR>
<P>Maybe a dying CMOS(?) battery?
<BR>
<P>Finally, I saw in the May archives that someone had a work around for
<BR>
updating the firmware when it just wouldn't work the way it should... but
<BR>
I couldn't find the details of the actual work around.  Does anyone
<BR>
remember what it was, or if it would apply to this situation? 
<BR>
<P><P>Thanks in advance for any help,
<BR>
