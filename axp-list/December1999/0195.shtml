<EM>&gt; &gt; Perhaps you can share with us Compaq's R&amp;D budget over the past few years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; so that we can see how this has dropped? Or perhaps some data on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; number of employees working on Alpha? and I suppose you've taken into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; account the other companies working on Alpha also (Samsung, API)?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have none.  I was only looking at this based on partisan announcements
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from the EOMs.  It seems that Intel puts out more iterations of is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; processors than does Compaq.  Also, I was looking to spur arguments so I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can understand why Alpha over Intel.  Can you give such definitive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information?  It would be greatly appreciated!  :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Microsoft put out more iterations of Windows than Linux
<BR>
(Win3.1,Win95,Win98,WinNT, Win2000 etc...). Does that make it better?
<BR>
(I know, if you count the distributions, maybe Linux puts out more, but
<BR>
you get the point?).
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; This is allowing Intel to catchup and surpass Alphas based on on CPU
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; speed and price (i.e. bang-for-the-buck).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Please, opinions are one thing, but this is just flame bait.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You are correct.  Guilty as charged.  As stated above, I need information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the people on this list probably have what I need.  Again, can you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; help?  Why Alpha?  Arguments based on Processor, subsystems, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; architecture are good.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then ask for it. Usually the way to get information out of people is to
<BR>
ask, not to offend them.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; On another note, I'd also reccomend looking for the SX machines, or even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; some PC164 machines (just saw some PC164-433 motherboards on ebay). The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; performance is much greater than the old axpPCI33.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SX based systems, huh?  I guess they can give the price/performance break
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the newer Intel's can?
</EM><BR>
<P>That depends. what are you planning on doing with these systems? Alpha
<BR>
excels at fp (the SX was a cheaper design and that point was actually
<BR>
for the previous poster, who was interested in the axpPCI33), if the work
<BR>
you are doing involves floating point math then yes, you could probably
<BR>
get a higher price/performance then Intel. If you're planning on selling
<BR>
these machine to home users that use them for web surfing and word
<BR>
processing, go with Intel, or AMD. The home user will probably be happy
<BR>
with the Celeron.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I picked up my SX164 (that's a 533MHz 21164PC) for $250, what's the going
<BR>
price of a PIII-700 and motherboard?
<BR>
<P>You may want to look at the information on the alphalinux.org site about
<BR>
the EV8 cpus and where Compaq is taking the Alpha. (news article several
<BR>
sections down). I think there is also a presentation on the EV7 on the old
<BR>
Compaq OEM site.
