<P>
<EM>&gt;and I have been waiting to try it out but haven't had the chance until now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sadly the settings don't seem to work. The existing settings for 433 are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as above but inverted - ON on the switch bank is the side away from the
</EM><BR>
processor.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;I tried various related combinations but none seem to work. I am assuming
</EM><BR>
there
<BR>
<EM>&gt;is no difference at this level between a 433a and a 433au - I think that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;just the boot firmware.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Most of the machines I heard about are inverted from mine.  I think it is
<BR>
shimply a different electrical set up in the DIP switches.  I didn't send
<BR>
the updated version to the list, I think it is linked from alphalinux.org
<BR>
somewhere under hardware / PWS / miata, but the 'update' simply has a note
<BR>
that some machines have inverted switches.
<BR>
<P>If you've tried the inverted for the 500 and it doesn't work, maybe you have
<BR>
a CPU that isn't very overclockable.
<BR>
<P>I still run my 500 as 500, I decided I wanted more reliability / longer
<BR>
service life or wait until I find a cheap 600+ CPU.
<BR>
