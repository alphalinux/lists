<P>This doesn't help much but at least you know there is *one* way which
<BR>
has worked well anyway. I didn't use  a custom install since I had it
<BR>
choke on me about 10 times for redhat 6.0 on x86. I successfully updated to
<BR>
RedHat 6.1 on a DS10 with only an IDE HD and CDROM  (1 HD so no raid) by
<BR>
burning the 6.1-alpha.iso myself and booting it using the SRM console. I bought
<BR>
the DS10 from Compaq under their recent Linux ready online  deal so it already
<BR>
had Redhat 6.0 installed. The update went very smoothly even though I had all
<BR>
sorts of rawhide+6.0 combinations. The update didn't update only those RPM from
<BR>
6.0 but all RPM's apparently (no custom update selected). Since I routinely boot
<BR>
into 2.3.x kernels and use ipnatctl and iptables facility for IP masquerading
<BR>
and filtering it was nice the update didn't touch those 2.3.x facilities. 
<BR>
<P>As an aside, I booted NetBSD 1.4.2 and ran it diskless on the DS10 today
<BR>
so all you need is some machine that supports bootp,tftp and nfs and an a hour
<BR>
or so of adjusting config files. In my case it took longer but I'm stupid. e.g.
<BR>
the DS10 console manual said ew*0_mode = fast is fast SCSI so I took that to
<BR>
mean it had nothing to do with wanting to use 100BaseTX which my NFS server
<BR>
uses and its dhcpd wasn't in a talking mood last night. The basic fileset to
<BR>
boot multiuser to a console is about 16MB gzipped if your bandwidth doesn't
<BR>
allow 650MB downloads.
<BR>
Hey, just a suggestion, no wizzy redhat logos but it works :-)
