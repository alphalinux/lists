<EM>&gt; not the Livewire+ which is definitely unsupported, but it's not listed as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supported either, potluck I guess.  Any help is greatly appreciated (I'm

<EM>&gt; sure this is an easy one, I'm just not looking in the right place).

<P>Hi there.
<BR>
<P>I just set my multia up for PCMCIA and as a firewall/bridge. I started
<BR>
with the PCMCIA howto, and selected the 3.0.14 version of PCMCIA from
<BR>
soundforge.org. I compiled it against the stock 2.2.13-0.9 kernel, and
<BR>
followed the directions to &quot;Red Hat&quot;-ify the installation. To my
<BR>
surprise it worked flawlessly. THen I followed the instructions in the
<BR>
Firewall+Bridge to set that up, which also worked the first time (I was
<BR>
surprised). I'm not actually using it as a firewall now because I think
<BR>
it slows down my net connection, and it (of course) prevents me from
<BR>
ssh-ing into my home box from work. If I can be of any help, drop me an
<BR>
email. I can try to help, but I still am not sure how I pulled it off.
<BR>
BTW- I had no problems with the 6.1 installer on my machine. Let me know
<BR>
what problems you had.
