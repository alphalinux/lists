<P>For the less than $1000 market yes, Alpha is not really an option unless
<BR>
you are willing to hunt down a motherboard/CPU combination and put the
<BR>
thing together for yourself.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This is especially due to bad IDE support (I have a 164SX), which means
</EM><BR>
<P>I thought that was fixed?
<BR>
<P>IDE performance on the LX is excellent.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; you need to get expensive SCSI card (cause el'cheapo cards don't work well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with Alpha/Linux), SCSI hard disk, cdrom, burner etc. if you want to enjoy
</EM><BR>
<P>This is true, I had a hell of a time finding a SCSI card that would work
<BR>
on my Alpha.  Ended up getting an Adaptec 2940UW because that is what we
<BR>
have on our systems at work.  However, I also have 25GB of IDE drives in
<BR>
my box and performance is not bad at all.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; speed. Each of items listed are notably more expensive then their IDE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; counterparts. Not to mention 'special' RAM needed by Alpha - I can't buy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RAM like that in just any computer shop. At least no here in my country.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; :)
</EM><BR>
<P>True, but the memory is available.  Simply choosing Linux puts you on the
<BR>
outskirts of acceptable computing behaviour anyway so why not just take
<BR>
that extra step :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; High-end market shows a different picture, though. In price range over 3k
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; US$ (I'm only guessing, this margin could be different) you get more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power/buck with an Alpha as Xeons also get shamelessly expensive. :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep.  But considering we paid similar money for our 533LX boxes as others
<BR>
are paying for PIII systems we don't feel too upset, especially in view of
<BR>
the performance figures we get which show the 164LX being 2x quicker clock
<BR>
for clock than x86 processors for integer work and even better for FP.
<BR>
<P>I was at a meeting a few weeks back at Daresbury Labs where they are
<BR>
running a Beowulf cluster of x86s and are pleased with them but the next
<BR>
version is going to run Alphas.
