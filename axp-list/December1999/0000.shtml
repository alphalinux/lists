I occasionally experience &quot;fork: Cannot allocate memory&quot; errors in 
<BR>
situations where networking load is fairly high (I have rather
<BR>
busy DNS, SMTP and www caching services on this box, which is
<BR>
a LX 533 MHz with 512MB RAM), but there is still plenty of memory
<BR>
available (~150MB, as reported by &quot;free&quot; after subtraction of
<BR>
buffers/cache), and swap is untouched.
<BR>
<P>This is basically the same problem I had back in june
<BR>
( <A HREF="http://www.lib.uaa.alaska.edu/axp-list/archive/1999-06/">http://www.lib.uaa.alaska.edu/axp-list/archive/1999-06/</A> ,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;thread &quot;fork: Cannot allocate memory&quot; ). With 2.2.7 I had it
<BR>
every few days or hours; with 2.0.37 every few months, but is
<BR>
now increasing as load grows and becoming annoying again.
<BR>
<P>Now I noticed with horror that
<BR>
# cat /proc/sys/vm/freepages
<BR>
536     0       804
<BR>
that is (see /usr/src/linux/Documentation/memory-tuning.txt)
<BR>
the free_pages_low parameter is zero ; I observe the same in
<BR>
other alphalinux systems running 2.0.36.  
<BR>
So this 0 is likely to be the reason of my errors:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;free_pages_low should probably be about double of min_free_pages,
<BR>
say the docs.
<BR>
<P>Now I was wondering where this 0 is coming from, as the same file
<BR>
also says:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The values selected as boot defaults are the following:  For a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;machine with n&gt;=8 Megabytes of memory, set min_free_pages = n*2,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;free_pages_low = n*3 and free_pages_high = n*4.  Machines with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8 Megabytes or less behave as if they had 8 Megabytes.
<BR>
so at boot time I should have had
<BR>
1024	1536	2048
<BR>
and so all three these parameters are falling down.  Why?
<BR>
Anybody else seeing vm parameters falling down?
