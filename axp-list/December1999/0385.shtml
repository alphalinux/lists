</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The seller claims it's a PWS500a. But the specs don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; really match my PWS500a. Do the specs match closer to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the XP1000? (except for the 21164a part).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hmm.  That is a strange-looking beastie indeed, D7.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For those who have not yet looked, it is listed as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; following (only the relevant parts shown):
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - Digital Alpha Pw 500a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - &quot;Manufactured May 99&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - 500Mhz 21164
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - max 2GB memory in 6 slots
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - 8 slots - 2 64-bit PCI, 2 32-bit PCI, 2 shared, 2 EISA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - Integrated Qlogic controller
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - 1 Parallel, 2 USB, 2 serial connectors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am almost inclined to say it is a Digital Ultimate Workstation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thats been mislabeled, or perhaps a 500a upgraded to an XP1000 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (if thats possible?). 
</EM><BR>
<P>What is it that's bothering you about the description?
<BR>
<P>If it's the builtin QLogic, you should be aware that the second generation
<BR>
of MIATA, known internally as MIATA GL, does have such.  And it was never
<BR>
made obvious from the model numbers, AFAIK, so it all depends on when the
<BR>
box was made - May 99 surely tags it as a GL...
<BR>
<P>Or is it the fact it's called a 21164 and not 21164a? You also should know
<BR>
that (IIRC) we ever sold anything officially labelled a 21164a.  We sold
<BR>
21164 in two speed ranges, where the one going 366 or faster was known
<BR>
*unofficially* as the A part.
<BR>
<P>Or is it this:
<BR>
<P>Slots: (Total 8) PCI 64-bit - 2, PCI 32-bit - 2, 1 Shared PCI/ISA - 2, EISA - 2
<BR>
<P>I believe this to be wrong; I believe MIATA (inc. GL) have 2 @ 64 and 2 @ 32,
<BR>
plus 2 ISA, at least one of the ISA and 1 @ 32 PCI being shared/paired.
<BR>
<P>XP1000 (aka MONET at 500MHz, aka BRISBANE @ 667) has 2 @ 64 and 3 @ 32 plus
<BR>
only a single ISA, therefore 1 shared/paired.
<BR>
<P>In addition, XP1000 has 8 DIMM slots, vs the 6 of MIATA.
<BR>
<P>They do resemble each other quite a lot, both externally and internally,
<BR>
with the builtin Ethernet and sound, same style cabinet, etc. They *were*
<BR>
both designed by the Workstation group, so it is understandable.
<BR>
<P>AFAIK, PWS cannot be upgraded to XP1000, so I believe the &quot;upgrade to next
<BR>
generation&quot; is wrong, unless it really means &quot;to a 600MHz 21164 chip&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Something not mentioned on the auction site and worth noting: MIATAs don't
<BR>
always come with BCache, in either original or GL, and its quite an expensive
<BR>
upgrade. I'd be likely to assume a GL would have cache, but it might not.
<BR>
<P>Forewarned is fore-armed... ;-}
