<P>
<EM>&gt; I know this isn't exactly Linux related, but I recently ordered (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; received) the $99 Tru64 Non-commercial kit.  A couple of weeks later, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; received another box from Compaq with a bunch of OpenVMS stuff in it.  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seems to be the software product library for OpenVMS and part of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Software Loan Program&quot; with short time licenses for OpenVMS and related
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; products.  Did anyone else get this ?  It doesn't seem like the OpenVMS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operating system is on one of the CDs, but there seems to be time limited
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; licenses for it.  Kind of makes me curious about playing with OpenVMS and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reliving my grad student days when I used VAX.....  
</EM><BR>
<P>The same thing happened to some others (myself included).  Since
<BR>
I have a couple of Alphas that I use with OpenVMS, the SPL+OLD
<BR>
was a welcome surprise.  If you'd like to use OpenVMS, check out
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.montagar.com/hobbyist/">http://www.montagar.com/hobbyist/</A> for more information.  You can
<BR>
buy an OpenVMS V7.2 media kit there as well.
