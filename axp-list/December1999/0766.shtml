The Mustang is slow because it's...er, because it's an old box. You need
<BR>
more RAM to get respectable speed. I have 96M and it works pretty well
<BR>
with that. I'd expect 97% mem usage with only 32M.
<BR>
<P>The kernel is in the /boot directory, so load it with:
<BR>
<P>sda5:boot/vmlinuz-2.2.5-16
<BR>
<P>Make sure you install *all* updates for RH6.0 too.
<BR>
<P>For ethernet, edit conf.modules and set eth0 to be de4x5 instead
<BR>
of tulip.

Subject: Newbie questions...
<BR>
<P><P>I finally got red hat 6 going on my mustang (4/233) and I am wondering a few
<BR>
things...
<BR>
<P>1.	First of all, it's slow...waaay slow (compared to NT anyway). Under
<BR>
gnome I brought up a system info thing and it showed 97% mem usage (32 megs)
<BR>
and the only thing up was the system info window. I'm assuming something is
<BR>
amiss. (The dos partition and linux native partitions are both 2 gig and the
<BR>
linux swap is 127M)
<BR>
<P>2.	Where is the kernel? In the boot selection I have:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OSLOADOPTIONS=boot sda5:generic.gz root=/dev/sda7
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I didn't know where it was, I put a generic.gz (same
<BR>
avanti as from the cd)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kernel I pulled off the net on my 10M partition where I have
<BR>
the winnt boot stuff. I tried some
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stuff from /boot on sda7 and it didn't seem to work.
<BR>
<P>3.	My ethernet card no worky.  I get a [FAILED] during boot for
<BR>
'Bringing up interface eth0'. During installation, it seemed to recognize my
<BR>
card just fine, so I have no idea what's wrong. I gave it an ip address and
<BR>
it can't even ping itself. I need to get the nic working first, but I was
<BR>
also wondering if there are any special precautions if I'm running
<BR>
serverless (peer to peer).
<BR>
<P>p.s. - I am a major novice and a dos junkie at that...
