<EM>&gt; &gt; - max 2GB memory in 6 slots
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; - 8 slots - 2 64-bit PCI, 2 32-bit PCI, 2 shared, 2 EISA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What is it that's bothering you about the description?
</EM><BR>
Mainly those two, and the combination of the specs assumed to be
<BR>
all in one box. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; If it's the builtin QLogic, you should be aware that the second generation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of MIATA, known internally as MIATA GL, does have such.  And it was never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; made obvious from the model numbers, AFAIK, so it all depends on when the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; box was made - May 99 surely tags it as a GL...
</EM><BR>
That is interesting.  I guess the product descriptions for the DPW/DUW
<BR>
line have not been updated on the website? I see no mention of USB 
<BR>
connectors or integrated Qlogic controllers (though EIDE is mentioned).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I believe this to be wrong; I believe MIATA (inc. GL) have 2 @ 64 and 2 @ 32,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plus 2 ISA, at least one of the ISA and 1 @ 32 PCI being shared/paired.
</EM><BR>
My earlier 500 has one 64, one shared 64, two shared 32, and one 32. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Something not mentioned on the auction site and worth noting: MIATAs don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; always come with BCache, in either original or GL, and its quite an expensive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; upgrade. I'd be likely to assume a GL would have cache, but it might not.
</EM><BR>
Yeah, but tearing out the L2/L3 cache seems all the rage today....
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Forewarned is fore-armed... ;-}
</EM><BR>
I'm happy with what I got.  It was more a &quot;gosh look at that thing&quot; 
<BR>
reaction (grin).
