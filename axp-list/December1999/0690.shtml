<P>
On all of our Alpha's I've had trouble with autonegotiation with the ethernet.
<BR>
Considering forcing the DS10 to 10Mbit.  We had a switch that was supposed to
<BR>
autonegotiate, and our XP1000 and the DS10 were supposed to, they didn't.  We had
<BR>
really slow, below 10Mbit transfer times.  When we forced them all to the same
<BR>
thing(we're using 100Mbit, it worked great.
<BR>
<P>Just a thought.

<EM>&gt; &gt; This doesn't help much but at least you know there is *one* way which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; has worked well anyway. I didn't use  a custom install since I had it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; choke on me about 10 times for redhat 6.0 on x86. I successfully updated to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; RedHat 6.1 on a DS10 with only an IDE HD and CDROM  (1 HD so no raid) by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; burning the 6.1-alpha.iso myself and booting it using the SRM console. I bought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the DS10 from Compaq under their recent Linux ready online  deal so it already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; had Redhat 6.0 installed. The update went very smoothly even though I had all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sorts of rawhide+6.0 combinations. The update didn't update only those RPM from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 6.0 but all RPM's apparently (no custom update selected). Since I routinely boot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; into 2.3.x kernels and use ipnatctl and iptables facility for IP masquerading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and filtering it was nice the update didn't touch those 2.3.x facilities.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; As an aside, I booted NetBSD 1.4.2 and ran it diskless on the DS10 today
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; so all you need is some machine that supports bootp,tftp and nfs and an a hour
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or so of adjusting config files. In my case it took longer but I'm stupid. e.g.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the DS10 console manual said ew*0_mode = fast is fast SCSI so I took that to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; mean it had nothing to do with wanting to use 100BaseTX which my NFS server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; uses and its dhcpd wasn't in a talking mood last night. The basic fileset to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; boot multiuser to a console is about 16MB gzipped if your bandwidth doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; allow 650MB downloads.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Hey, just a suggestion, no wizzy redhat logos but it works :-)
