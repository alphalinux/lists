<P>
Yes, it does.  Several people on this list seem to have done it.  I am
<BR>
currently trying it and I'll let you know what I know soon.
<BR>
<P>By the way, you're right, there is no MILO image for these machines the
<BR>
installation process is done through the SRM and you can boot directly from
<BR>
the CD and install aboot on your HD after install.

Subject: AS 3300? does it run Linux?
<BR>
<P><P>As far as I can tell these look just like the AS800's but are targeted as
<BR>
NT machines with Alphabios. Is their an SRM available for them or might
<BR>
the SRM from the 800  work on it? I don't see a milo for the 800 so
<BR>
I doubt their would be one for the 3300, or is there? Thanks.
