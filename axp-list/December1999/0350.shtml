<P>
After playing around with the PC164 some this afternoon, I have made a
<BR>
fair amount of progress.  Thought I'd share my experiences.
<BR>
<P>Following Jim Barriault's (?) advice I replaced the battery.  It takes a
<BR>
CR2032; I found a DL2032 (Duracell work-alike) at the local Best Buy, and
<BR>
it seems to work fine.
<BR>
<P>I plugged in a new floppy drive and cable, which seems to work as
<BR>
intended, which none of the previous ones did.  I'm not sure if this is
<BR>
because the other two floppies were bad or because changing the battery
<BR>
helped.
<BR>
<P>After that I successfully upgraded from ARC to SRM using the fail-safe
<BR>
booter.  On reboot I only got a blinking cursor in a field of blue, but
<BR>
(following Robb Romans' advice) I hit the return key and promptly got a
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; prompt.  Shoulda thought of that myself...
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm now trying to determine what kind of SCSI card to use in there.  SRM
<BR>
didn't recognize the Adaptec 2940UW at all, of course.  It recognizes a
<BR>
Symbios card but won't give a firmware path to the device or list any
<BR>
drives off of it.  I need to double-check that it is a fully supported
<BR>
model, and then trouble shoot from there (not sure the card works in a PC,
<BR>
either). 
<BR>
<P>It looks like SRM v5.5 recognizes the IDE controller.  It even gives me a
<BR>
path to the controller but until I plug some IDE drives back in I don't
<BR>
know what will happen from there.  However, given that the XP1000 ships
<BR>
with an IDE CD-ROM (if I recall correctly), I think there is a fighting
<BR>
chance of getting it working as an IDE-only system if I can't find a SCSI
<BR>
controller that works.  (I want to try out Digital UNIX, thus the note
<BR>
about the XP1000.)  Of course, it'd be a shame to waste that fast of a
<BR>
system on IDE drives...
<BR>
<P>The point of all this is that people just starting in on using the PC164
<BR>
should:
<BR>
<P>- Replace the battery before anything else.
<BR>
<P>- Try different floppies, drives, cables, etc. if you have a hard time
<BR>
using them from the Firmware.
<BR>
<P>- Check the hardware compatibility list for what SRM supports.  (I am
<BR>
about to go do that myself.)
<BR>
<P>All of that has been mentioned here before, or is (should be) obvious, but
<BR>
I thought I'd confirm it and list it all together. 
<BR>
<P>More later,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Joel
