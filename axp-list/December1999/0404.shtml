<P>In the months before the XP1000 was sold, there was an

offer 'order your PWS and upgrade later!' on DEC's

site.  I'm not sure how 'MONET' is in the inside, but
<BR>
I think the offer may have been something like you

ship them the machine and they put your parts in a new
<BR>
one, but given the modular nature of the motherboard,
<BR>
I wouldn't be surprised if they just swapped the
<BR>
mainboard and the daughtercard.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Something not mentioned on the auction site and
</EM><BR>
worth noting: MIATAs don't always come with BCache, in
<BR>
either original or GL, and its quite an expensive
<BR>
upgrade. I'd be likely to assume a GL would have
<BR>
cache, but it might not.&lt;
<BR>
<P>My system didn't come with a BCache, which was a bit
<BR>
of a disappointment, as I thought they all did, the
<BR>
description should have noted it IMO.  The cost
<BR>
depends greatly on where you buy and whether it was a
<BR>
new, a 'pull' or a reconditioned part.  I'm not
<BR>
exactly sure what mine was, but I bought mine for
<BR>
about 100$ from GLcomp.com, but it was an obsolete
<BR>
part number that I was told was for all intents the
<BR>
same as the current one - probably since sold out. 
<BR>
The 'current' 2MB part was about 250$ - and it used
<BR>
the same speed and same part numbers for chips, the
<BR>
4MB part was in the 1000$ neighborhood - ouch!
<BR>
<P>For CPU intensive stuff, I've noticed a consistent 25%
<BR>
speed increase on nearly everything I tested, but I
<BR>
haven't tested the bandwidth performance.
