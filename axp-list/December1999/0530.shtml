<P>
It's quite a nice setup. However, the CDs seem to have been mastered in the summer
<BR>
so by now there are more recent pieces (srm consoles in particular). Haven't
<BR>
looked in depth yet though.
<BR>
<P>Doesn't seem to want to install on my PWS500a. Stops when enabling dynamic memory.
<BR>
This box must have one of the memory impaired CPU chips (ie regarding the recent
<BR>
discussion of NT only cpu chips with dynamic memory functionality disabled).
<BR>
OpenVMS Hobbyist runs on the box so go figure.. (OpenVMS doesn't use dynamic
<BR>
memory functionality of the CPU according to the aforementioned discussion). I've
<BR>
a 164SX that I plan to run it on, &amp; its on the supported platform list so should
<BR>
be ok.
<BR>
<P>One caution. The install screens indicate that no changes will be made to the box
<BR>
untill all questions have been answered. Well, I managed to trash the boot block
<BR>
of my disk while just 'looking' so now I get to re-install whatever was previously
<BR>
on the box.
<BR>
<P>Worth the price of admission. Definitely.
<BR>
<P>Regards.

<P><EM>&gt; Hi everybody,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I was wondering if anybody that bought the $99 Tru64 can give me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some inputs about it. I mean I know some of you bought them only for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; libraries.. but if anybody did install the Tru64, any inputs will be great.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am thinking about buying it to actually test them in my alpha, but I do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have any knowledge/experience at all on Tru64/Digital Unix and alpha machines.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Basically like is it worth to buy, and how easy for installation etc. Can we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recompile linux apps/programs? (like gnome etc)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sorry if the question is not related to the list, you can direct the inputs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to my email address too instead of using the list.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yudi.
