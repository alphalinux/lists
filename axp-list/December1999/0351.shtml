I am trying to update an lx164 to SRM to run Tru64.  It locks up at
<BR>
'jumping to secondary boot strap' after validating the boot block on
<BR>
the cdrom.  I'm suspecting the Diamond GL Pro video card as not being
<BR>
a good match to the Elsa Gloria, even though its a Permedia2 based
<BR>
card.   What kind of video card to do you have?

<EM>&gt;I recently purchased an old AlphaPC 164 motherboard and processor, and am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;having a hard time getting it running.  Specifically, I am trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;replace the AlphaBIOS with SRM and just can't get it to work.  I'm also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;having some funkiness with the built-in IDE and floppy controllers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I know all of this has been answered on this list before, but after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;digging through the archive for an hour I haven't found solid answers to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all of my questions.  So.... please excuse the repetition. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;1.  I have Tru64 UNIX here, which includes the SRM Firmware Updates CD.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;copied off the AlphaPC164 directory to a FAT-formatted floppy and tried
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Update Firmware&quot; in AlphaBIOS.  I get blinky lights for 3 seconds, then a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;device error&quot; without further info. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;2.  Interestingly, AlphaBIOS seems to be recognizing the floppy only if it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is plugged into the first port on the cable; that is, the one before the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;twist.  If it is plugged into the end (after the twist) it will recognize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it, but only as a secondary floppy.  Isn't this backwards? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;3.  I have tried running fwupdate.exe directly (&quot;Run a program: &quot; with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;either &quot;a:\fwupdate.exe&quot; or &quot;multi(0)disk(0)fdisk(0)\fwupdate.exe&quot;) and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;get the same behavior as in 1.) above.  Yes, I have tried different floppy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;drives and cables.  Yes, I have them plugged into the motherboard with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;red wire on the 1 pin. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;4.  A Fail Safe Boot firmware update accesses the floppy drive for about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;50 seconds, with the screen blank, but nothing is different when I reboot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;after that. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;5.  With the Firmware CD in an ATAPI CD-ROM drive on the secondary IDE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bus, I get the same behavior as with the floppy.  Tried blind, dumb
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;upgrade firmware&quot; as well as permutations on &quot;run a program&quot;.  Don't have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a spare ATAPI CD-ROM to try to make sure it's not hatred for this specific
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;drive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;6.  With the Firmware CD in a SCSI CD-ROM drive attatched to an Adaptec
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;2940UW SCSI controller, I get nothing (&quot;device error&quot; again I believe) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;when I try an &quot;update firmware&quot; from the main screen.  If I try to run it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;directly (run program scsi(0)cdrom(4)fdisk(0)\alphapc164\fwupdate.exe) I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;get an &quot;Invalid image&quot; error.  Which I take to mean that the executable is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not valid for some reason...? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;7.  Installing Windows NT from CD-ROM (with the SCSI CD-ROM) works great. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It dies when it can't find the floppy drive for the drivers floppy (only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have a two connector floppy cable right now, so NT would have to look to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;drive B: I guess, which it won't do), but other than that it works fine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm going to continue trying different permutations (ATAPI CD-ROM on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;primary bus) and work arounds (disguise fwupdate.exe as the NT installer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;program; put fwupdate.exe on a hard drive; etc.), but I wanted to make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sure I wasn't doing something obviously wrong.  Could the power supply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(only 275W, from PC Power &amp; Cooling) be too weak, thus causing some subtle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;brown out, such that everything works fine except the firmware update?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Likewise, I have the green ATX soft-power wire grounded to the side of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;power supply (both ends of the wire: PS and motherboard ends).  Should I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;instead ground it to the neighboring black ground wire?  Is this perhaps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;subtlely screwing things up?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Maybe a dying CMOS(?) battery?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Finally, I saw in the May archives that someone had a work around for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;updating the firmware when it just wouldn't work the way it should... but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I couldn't find the details of the actual work around.  Does anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;remember what it was, or if it would apply to this situation? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Thanks in advance for any help,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	-Joel
