Hi,
<BR>
<P>As some of you know, I've been trying to track down a copy of the Alpha
<BR>
motherboard SDK V4.0 for some time. The latest I have heard is this:
<BR>
<P>&quot;The Alphamotherboard software developers kit is no longer orderable
<BR>
through Compaq. This was discontinued when the Alpha OEM business was sold
<BR>
to Qualified OEM's. Unfortunately it is no longer available through us. &quot;
<BR>
<P>I'd like to know why this was sold!
<BR>
<P>My question is, does anyone know who this Qualified OEM might be? 
<BR>
What on the CD is freely distributable (that someone can send me) and what
<BR>
isn't? Does anyone want to sell me theirs?
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
Daniel
