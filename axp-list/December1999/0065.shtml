Hi all...
<BR>
<P>I just finished building my PC164 system with a Millennium G200 and Intel
<BR>
Ether Express Pro 100 and Tekram 390F card and it comes up into ARC just
<BR>
fine. I'm booting a custom-built 2.2.13 kernel with minimal support (SCSI,
<BR>
Ethernet, FP completion) and it runs fine for a few hours, but then
<BR>
suddenly zonks out. The monitor says &quot;no signal&quot; and the reset button
<BR>
doesn't do any good. The ethernet LEDs go out.
<BR>
<P>Power cycling makes the keyboard LEDs do a happy dance, but there still is
<BR>
no video signal.
<BR>
<P>FYI I took the green wire for power on (from the power supply) and
<BR>
grounded it against a ground wire.
<BR>
<P>The only partial remedy is for me to unplug the motherboard from the power
<BR>
supply, take out the battery, and let it sit overnight. Then it'll come up
<BR>
okay, but only until it does it again.
<BR>
<P>I was running a 2.0.36 kernel that came with the boot disks (debian) and
<BR>
that was running for about five days. Could this be software related? If
<BR>
it was software related, why wouldn't a power cycle fix it?
<BR>
<P>thanks in advance for any help anyone can give me,
<BR>
<P><PRE>
