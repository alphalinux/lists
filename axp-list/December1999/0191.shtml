<P>
Tony,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Speed (MHz) is not everything,  Having a stable system that is fast is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much more important to me.  Originally the speed of the Alphas attracted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me, but now it is much more the stability factor.  This goes as much for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; servers that I install as my own workstations.
</EM><BR>
<P>Now that's interesting.  I thought the Intel platforms were stable.
<BR>
That's why the NASA Beowulf clusters are on Intel-based machines and not
<BR>
Alpha-based machines.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you want to be a sheep, go ahead, add to the un-informed masses.
</EM><BR>
<P>HA HA HA!!  :-)  I'm just looking for information to support an Alpha over
<BR>
Intel argument.  I can't really think of one now that COTS (Common off the
<BR>
shelf) Intel-based PCs are so cheap and stable.  Have you seen the new HP
<BR>
Brio?  A Celeron 450 based system for $500.00.  Not bad for a mass
<BR>
produced, for the sheep, style machine, huh?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Personally, I have no desire to have &quot;inhell inside&quot; stuck to anything I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own.  I will go out of my way to avoid the brain dead architecture that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still has backward compatibility to the 4004.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Though I basically understand what you are saying . . . the Alpha is a
<BR>
cleaner, faster design than any Intel based legacy system.  However, the
<BR>
herd is going cheap, Intel based hardware.  You notice Linux is home-grown
<BR>
on Intel.  It must be ported to Alpha processors.
<BR>
<P>Don't get me wrong . . . I do not have any allegence to any single
<BR>
processor or OS.  However, I do like Open Source.  I think this is the 
<BR>
way of the future in computer science.  Thus, I like Linux and the xBSD's 
<BR>
as well as Alpha, Intel, PA-RISC, and UltraSPARC based hardware.  Heck, I
<BR>
even like the positively ancient PDP-11 systems just to tinker with.
<BR>
<P>So . . . why Alpha?  What are your arguments for Alpha and/or against
<BR>
Intel?
<BR>
<P>Paul
