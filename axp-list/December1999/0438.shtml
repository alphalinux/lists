<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Using fsk to check the validity of the target isn't a reliable check

<EM>&gt; The second clause of this sentence is true, but the first clause doesn't go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with it. Since all the files you care about aren't changing, this technique
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does work, and I've used it about 1000 times with no failures. If you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really worried, boot into single user mode, remount the source partition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; read only, and then make the copy. But it's a waste of your time.
</EM><BR>
<P>The second clause does, in fact, go with the first.  Under certain
<BR>
circumstances, making a blockwise copy from from a rw mounted disk to
<BR>
another might be &quot;safe&quot;; however, running fsk isn't necessarily
<BR>
sufficient to identify copying problems.  
<BR>
<P>If dd has already copied the inode table for a given set of filesystem
<BR>
blocks, then, before dd completes writing these blocks, they are
<BR>
changed, fsck will be unable to identify the copying problem.  This
<BR>
means that any file which is written to during the copy is vulnerable
<BR>
to undetectable (with fsck) corruption.
<BR>
<P>This means what?  That fsck &quot;isn't a reliable check&quot; of blockwise
<BR>
copies of rw mounted filesystems.  Anyone planing to use dd to
<BR>
duplicate disks should be aware of this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; If you create a minimal system which allows you to boot from a diskette
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and connect to a network, you can perform this type of disk duplication
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; over your LAN (dd if=/dev/sda | rsh somehost 'dd of=/dev/sda').
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is impossible on an alpha, because the binaries are too big. Intead I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wrote a program which compiles down to just 30 kbytes which configs the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interface and does the copy and uncompress.
</EM><BR>
<P>When you are ready to release this I'm sure many people would find it
<BR>
useful.
