<P>
Several people have mentioned the Motion Video Instructions (MVI) that have 
<BR>
been
<BR>
added to recent versions of Alpha uPs, usually asking if anyone has employed 
<BR>
them
<BR>
in some sort of beneficial way, like for video or audio codecs.  However, no 
<BR>
one ever
<BR>
seems to respond saying that they are actually being used.  So, I searched 
<BR>
around
<BR>
and found a fairly comprehensive list of resources just waiting to be used.  
<BR>
Since the
<BR>
document was by no means particularly easy to find, I put it on my web page 
<BR>
and updated
<BR>
some of the obsolete links; you can reach it at: <A HREF="http://www.people.cornell.edu/">http://www.people.cornell.edu/</A>
<BR>
pages/clc31/pc164/MVI-full.html
<BR>
<P>I would like to see an effort to use these instructions, especially since they 
<BR>
are so
<BR>
highly touted by marketing campaigns for the 21164PC and 21264.  This 
<BR>
definitely
<BR>
seems like the kind of thing that we all could benefit from: maybe by setting 
<BR>
up some sort
<BR>
of group of people interested in developing GPL software to take advantage of 
<BR>
MVI.
<BR>
<P>Your thoughts on this issue are, of course, welcome!
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
