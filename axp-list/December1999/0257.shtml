<EM>&gt; &gt; Intel Celeron 400 - 822 seconds == 9 million cell updates/sec 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Alpha 164LX 533 - 316 seconds == 25 million cell updates/sec 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Alpha 264EV67 667 - 164 seconds == 46 million cell updates/sec 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Alphas are good, very very good. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Let's go thru the math on this. If one can buy a 400mhz Celeron 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for 500 quid or less, and an XP1000 for 8000 quid, (which sounds high)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then one gets at least 16 Celerons for that XP1000. 9x16=144 million 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cell updates per second vs 46M updates. Now, I'd be curious where one 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can purchase those 533LX's at 1100 quid. In the US, 533LX's go
</EM><BR>
<P>We got ours from Compusys, ex VAT of course.  The price will vary
<BR>
depending on the spec of what you get of course, I recommend going for the
<BR>
lowest possible and upgrading it yourself with off the shelf parts.  For
<BR>
instance, we put a 20GB IDE drive in each of our machines for 170 quid
<BR>
each, could probably do better now of course.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; for around US$1995, approximately 1230 quid. Even so, I think one 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could put together a Celeron for much less than 500 quid. A 400mhz 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Celeron and motherboard go for $120. One can add a disk/case/memory 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and have a reasonable system for less than $500. So, given US prices, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one can buy 4 Celerons for the price of a 533LX, 9*4=36M updates/sec 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vs 25M on a 21164. Worst case, using your 533LX price, you still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might be able to get 4 Celerons, depending on memory/disk you buy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or maybe 3 which makes the 21164 a wash vs Celeron in price/performance.
</EM><BR>
<P>Probably although you would then need to go to the effort of writing an
<BR>
MPI version of the code which would likely lose you a little performance,
<BR>
I doubt that a 4 celeron system would be much faster if at all then a
<BR>
single 533LX in fact.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; There are reasons to use Alphas.
</EM><BR>
<P>There sure are, for the same algorithm coded for the 64 bit architecture
<BR>
we are now hitting 182 million on the 164LX compared with the 9 million
<BR>
the celeron 400 gets.  One alpha is a heck of a lot cheaper than 20
<BR>
celeron boxes but that isn't really what I was saying, I wanted to show
<BR>
that the same program on an Alpha gets you better performance clock for
<BR>
clock for integer work which people seem to ignore.  It is accepted that
<BR>
for FP the alpha would be better, why not integer?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However, they may be cost effective for codes that need VERY high 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memory bandwidth or for codes that can't easily be parallelized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and you have the $$$$ to spend.
</EM><BR>
<P>True.  Of course, our code can be relatively easily parallelised in which
<BR>
case the Alpha pulls ahead nicely as for every one we buy we would need 20
<BR>
of the celeron boxes.  Not a general case of course but for us they are a
<BR>
boon.  We can get the same performance from four 164 boxes that we used to
<BR>
get with a $million supercomputer just four years ago.
