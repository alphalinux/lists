<EM>&gt; This was the work that got us interested.

<P>Interesting. Similar to what graphics folks do. Given
<BR>
that sort of implementation, the Intel should actually
<BR>
run very fast since it has those MMX instructions for
<BR>
just that sort of problem. It would be similar to what
<BR>
the paper talks about for the I860. You could build a
<BR>
simple asm macro instead of what the authors do for the 
<BR>
i860.
<BR>
<P>Not sure if I'd bother though unless it was really
<BR>
fast and #ifdef'd with equivalent C.
<BR>
<P>Still, I see no reason why one couldn't put two 15 bit words
<BR>
in a 32 bit word on an intel and improve it's performance
<BR>
as is done with 4 15 bit words on Alpha. Also, one could 
<BR>
implement the FP version of the algorithm and cut the
<BR>
Alpha's lead that way too. 
<BR>
<P>One question though. Why are you comparing only 15 bits
<BR>
at a time? Is this something intrinsic to the problem?
<BR>
Why not directly use 32 or 64 bits??
