	Thanks to everyone for thier help and advice on using the Zip<br>
drive for a rescue disk. I have it working wonderfully for my Linux/Intel<br>
boxes, off of my Parallel Port drive with a kernel floppy.<br>
	I also got the Zip drive working with my UDB. The newest driver<br>
for ppa that I grabbed off the net autodetected the zip drive even on the<br>
alpha! Though that driver is quite a bit newer than the ones found in the<br>
2.0.30 kenerl. <br>
	Though when I went to install RedHat AXP onto the zip disk from<br>
the Alpha, I ended up hitting a snag. First of all, in order to get the<br>
installation system to recongize the ppa zip disk, I had to compile a new<br>
alpha kernel, place it on a floppy and use it as the boot disk in place of<br>
RedHat's boot disk. Then I used RedHat's root disk as usual. Everything<br>
seemed to go just fine, the install process never realized, or at least<br>
didn't care, I had switched kernels on it. I was able to see the zip drive<br>
as a SCSI disk, and the setup program recongized it as such.<br>
	The problem occured when I tried to fdisk the zip drive from the<br>
Alpha. When I tried to print the parition table, it prinited the first<br>
parition on the zip disk (the Linux/Intel rescue part), but there it<br>
froze, and so did the entire system. After rebooting, and loading my<br>
standard installation off of the hard disk as normal, I tried to run fdisk<br>
on the zip disk again. Same behavior as last time, only it really locked<br>
the machine up. The only response I could get from it at the console or<br>
across the network was pings. It was dead as a doornail otherwise. After<br>
rebooting again, I tried running fdisk and printing the parition table for<br>
the internal 340mb SCSI drive, and it printed my initial FAT parition, the<br>
swap parition, and then once again a solid lock up, with the main linux<br>
parition still to print.<br>
	I also tried in the setup program to not fdisk any disks, and<br>
proceed with them as they were (after I had them set up right on the<br>
zip disk off of my Linux/Intel box). But then on the part of "Initializing<br>
filesystems" I think was the name, where one chooses what will be mounted<br>
where, and what parition is the root filesystem, the entire system<br>
rebooted, with no warning!<br>
	It seems there is something amiss with fdisk. The only thing I can<br>
trace this to, as it was working just fine recently, is to a new kernel I<br>
just installed on the system, and then used in the setup process. It is a<br>
stock 2.0.30 kernel, with the alpha-patches-2.0.30-0.1 applied that I<br>
pulled off azstarnet. After that I have nothing strange compiled in the<br>
kernel, except for the new drivers for the ppa that I pulled off the net.<br>
Otherwise the system has been running fine, with fdisk as the only<br>
problem that I have hit yet.<br>
	Sorry for the long post, but this has got me stumped. Does any one<br>
know how I managed to break fdisk here? Is it due to the alpha-patches or<br>
due to the ppa drivers, since those are the only two new variables<br>
introduced since the last time fdisk worked. Thanks for any help!<br>
