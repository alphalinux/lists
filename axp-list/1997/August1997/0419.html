A&gt; Did you disable the COM1 and COM2 on the motherboard. How does one do that?<br>
<p>
Actually, I don't know whether one /can/ do that.<br>
<p>
A&gt; I know how to do that with BIOS but on Alpha, without ECU?<br>
<p>
You really should try to get an ECU; you'll find one on Gatekeeper.dec.com, for<br>
example. According to my experiences, any version will work. Be careful with<br>
your firmware; version 1.7 seems to work best; the most recent, 1.9 (AFAIK), is<br>
at least incompatible with the ELSA Winner 1000 graphics board in EISA mode,<br>
old versions are (according to DEC) incompatible with Windows NT 3.5 and 4.0, I<br>
didn't try them with Linux.<br>
<p>
A&gt; Should I use COM3 and COM4. In that case I guess I would have to share<br>
A&gt; interrupt with COM1 or COM2.<br>
<p>
No, I don't think so; as far as I remember, the internal ports use standard<br>
addresses, but not standard interrupts. You can definitely choose any interrupt<br>
your fifo serial card or internal modem supports, as far as it isn't used by<br>
another card or the system board.<br>
<p>
A&gt; Hm, that's no good solution either, because the internal serial ports<br>
A&gt; are  16450 compatible, not 16550, which means they don't supply a<br>
A&gt; buffer, so connections above 9600 may get huge error rates.<br>
<p>
I also think the error rate will most likely be much greater than that of a<br>
buffered serial port. I tried using a 14400 bps modem with a 16450 and got much<br>
better results with any of two different 16550. The cps rates were much better<br>
and almost no more lost carriers occured.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Maybe this is due to the fact I didn't run the ECU configuration (I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; know where to get the software from!)</i><br>
A&gt; Hmm, I guess that's unlikely. You probably got an ISA card, and the<br>
A&gt; ECU just makes sure, that you don't use the same resource for two<br>
A&gt; cards. If you do a careful setup, and you do know the resources of the<br>
A&gt; cards in use, you don't need the ECU for ISA cards.<br>
<p>
That seems to be true, my Jensen worked properly with incorrectly set up ECU.<br>
As far as I remember, I had changed my ISA network adapter's settings without<br>
changing also the ECU settings without any problems.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Too bad it is so difficult to find **any** documentation on this machine.</i><br>
<p>
Difficult? It's almost impossible... DEC obviously wants us to purchase more<br>
expensive machines rather than using prototypes.<br>
<p>
Viele Gruesse, Christoph<br>
