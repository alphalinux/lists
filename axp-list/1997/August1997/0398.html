THIS IS THE FAIREST MOST HONEST WAY I KNOW OF TO SHARE THE WEALTH!<br>
<p>
Hello!  Would you like to make thousands of dollars, quickly, legally,<br>
with NO CATCH?  Then keep reading....please take five minutes to read<br>
this article it will change your life, just like it did mine.  It's<br>
true!  You can make up to or over $50,000 dollars in 4-6 weeks, maybe<br>
sooner!  I SWEAR I'M NOT LYING TO YOU, AND THIS IS NOT A SCAM!  If<br>
you're interested, keep reading; if you're not, I apologize for <br>
wasting your time.<br>
<p>
        Here we go.  A little while back, I was browsing through these<br>
newsgroups, just as you are now, and came across an article similar to<br>
this that said you could make thousands of dollars in weeks with only an<br>
initial investment of $5!  So, I thought, "Yeah, right, must be a scam",<br>
but I was curious, like most of us, so I kept reading.  Anyway, it said<br>
that you send $1 to each of the 5 names and addresses stated in the<br>
article.  You then place your own name and address in the article at the<br>
bottom of the list at #5, and post the article in at least 200<br>
newsgroups (there are thousands).  No catch, that was it!<br>
<p>
        So after thinking it over, talking to a few people first, I<br>
tried it. I figured what have I got to lose except for 5 stamps and $5,<br>
right? Well, guess what...within 7 days, I started getting money in the<br>
mail! I was shocked!  I still figured it would end soon, and didn't give<br>
it another thought.  But then the money kept coming IN, tripling in size<br>
and multiplying by 10-20 times the amount that I got the first week!  In<br>
my first week, I made about 20 to 30 dollars.  But by the end of the<br>
second week, I had a mad total of over $1,000 dollars!!!! In the third<br>
week, I had over $10,000 dollars, and it's still growing.  This is now<br>
my fourth week (Oct 11) and I've made about $42,000 TOTAL, and the money<br>
is STILL coming in.....<br>
<p>
***This is the good news for the author of this article, this is not my<br>
history.  I am just now (Jan 7, 97) posting this article. When I start<br>
receiving money I will update this article and inform all of my good<br>
fortune. I am not going to lie to you, I am giving it a shot and I think<br>
you should too. Hey, it's certainly worth five bucks. We spend that on<br>
the lottery.<br>
<p>
        Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, WHY it<br>
works...also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so you can<br>
get the information off of it, and begin making money. (Also, you can <br>
save<br>
this article, Using "FILE: Save as", or Marking whole article and coping <br>
it <br>
to clipboard)<br>
<p>
        The process is very simple, and it consists of 3 EASY steps:<br>
<p>
STEP 1:  Get 5 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each<br>
sheet of paper..."PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST.  YOU ARE NUMBER<br>
4."  Get five $1 bills and place ONE inside each piece of paper that you<br>
just wrote on, and fold each piece of paper so the bill will not be seen<br>
in the envelope (otherwise, nosey people who like to steal envelopes<br>
with money in it will get yours).  Put one paper inside the envelope and<br>
seal it.  Do the same for all 5.  You should now have 5 envelopes<br>
sealed, EACH have a piece of paper AND a $1 bill stuffed inside of the<br>
paper.  Make sure those words that were stated above are stated on each<br>
peper.  What you are doing is creating a service by this, this is<br>
PERFECTLY LEGAL.  Now then, mail the 5 envelopes with paper and $1 in<br>
each to the following 5 addresses:<br>
<p>
 1.Joshua Hart<br>
    l350 du Fort, Apt.301<br>
    Montreal, Quebec H3H 2R7<br>
    Canada<br>
<p>
2.  William Holmes<br>
    1305 Fontenot St<br>
    Mamou, La 70554<br>
    U. S. A<br>
<p>
3.  Dustin Gross<br>
    13625 26th Place south<br>
    Seattle, Wa 98168<br>
    U. S. A.<br>
<p>
4.  Miwako Sakabayashi<br>
    Hakkin-Cho 1-20<br>
    Takaoka-Shi, Toyama 933<br>
    Japan<br>
<p>
5.  Tariq Bukres<br>
    9301 SW Hill Street<br>
    Portland, OR 97223<br>
    USA<br>
<p>
STEP 2:  Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the<br>
other 4 names up (5 becomes 4, 4 becomes 3, etc.) and put YOUR NAME as<br>
number 5 on the list.  You can slightly alter this article if you need<br>
to, editing what YOU need to edit.<br>
<p>
STEP 3:  Post your amended article (with your name at #5) to at least<br>
200 news groups (I think there's close to 18,000 of them).  All you need<br>
is say, at least 200.<br>
<p>
Extra Section:<br>
HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS FAST:<br>
If you have Netscape 3.0 do EXACTLY  the following:<br>
<p>
1)  Click on any news group like normal, THEN click on 'TO NEWS', which<br>
is on the far left when you're in the newsgroups page.  This will bring<br>
up a box to type a message in.<br>
<p>
2)  Leave the newsgroup box like it is, CHANGE the subject box to<br>
something flashy, like, "NEED CASH $$$  READ HERE $$$" or "FAST CASH"!!!<br>
<p>
3)  Tab once and you should be ready to type.  Now, retype (only once)<br>
THIS whole article WORD FOR WORD, except to insert your name at #5, and<br>
to remove #1 off the list, plus any other small change you think you<br>
need to make.  Keep almost all of it the SAME!<br>
<p>
4)  When you're done typing the WHOLE article, click on FILE in THIS<br>
BOX, RIGHT ABOVE SEND, NOT WHERE IT SAYS NETSCAPE NEWS ON THE FIRST BOX.<br>
Click on SAVE AS when you're under FILE.  Save your article as a text<br>
file to your C: or A: drive.  DO NOT SEND OR POST YOUR ARTICLE UNTIL YOU<br>
DO THIS.  Once saved, move on to number 5 below. (Shortcut: If you have <br>
saved this file or copied it to the clipboard, you just need to retrieve <br>
or copy it to your composition window. After modifications done, save it)<br>
<p>
5)  If you still have all of your text, send or post to this newsgroup<br>
now by just clicking send, which is right below FILE, and right above<br>
Cc:<br>
<p>
6)  Here's where you're going to post all 200.  OK, click on any news<br>
group then click on 'To News', again in the top left corner.  Leave the<br>
NEWSGROUPS BOX alone again, put a flashy subject title in the SUBJECT<br>
BOX, hit TAB once so you're in the body of the message, and then click<br>
on ATTACHMENTS, which is below the SUBJECT BOX.  You will get another<br>
box to come up.  Click on ATTACH FILE, then find YOUR file that you<br>
saved; click once on the file, and then click OPEN; now click on OK; if<br>
you did this right, you should see your file name in the attachments<br>
box, and it will be shaded green.<br>
<p>
IF YOU USE IE EXPLORER IT'S JUST AS EASY...HOLDING DOWN THE LEFT MOUSE<br>
BUTTON, HIGHLIGHT THIS ARTICLE. THEN PRESS THE "CTRL" KEY AND THE "C"<br>
KEY AT THE SAME TIME TO COPY THE ARTICLE.  THEN PRINT THIS ARTICLE FOR<br>
YOUR RECORDS TO HAVE THE NAMES OF THOSE YOU WILL BE SENDING $1 BILLS TO.<br>
NEXT, GO TO THE NEWS GROUPS AND PRESS "POST AN ARTICLE"  A WINDOW WILL<br>
OPEN. TYPE IN YOUR HEADLINE IN THE SUBJECT AREA AND THEN CLICK IN THE<br>
LARGE WINDOW BELOW.  PRESS "CTRL" AND THEN "V" AND THE ARTICLE WILL BE<br>
PLACED IN THE WINDOW.  IF YOU WANT TO EDIT THE ARTICLE, DO SO AND THEN<br>
HIGHTLIGHT AND COPY IT AGAIN. NOW EVERYTIME YOU POST THE ARTICLE IN A<br>
NEW NEWSGROUP ALL YOU HAVE TO REPEAT "CTRL" AND "V" AND PRESS POST.<br>
<p>
7)  That's it.  Each time you do this, all you have to do is type in a<br>
different newsgroup, so that way, it posts to 200 DIFFERENT newsgroups,<br>
you see?  Now you just have 199 to go!! (Don't worry, each one takes<br>
about 30 seconds, once you get used to it)  REMEMBER 200 IS A MINIMUM.<br>
The more you post to, the more money you will make.<br>
<p>
AND THAT'S IT!!!  THAT'S THE ONLY 3 STEPS THERE IS!!!!<br>
<p>
You are now in the mail order business and will start receiving your $1<br>
envelopes from various people all over the world within days.  HINT:<br>
THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST TO, THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE.  You may<br>
want to rent a PO Box eventually because of all the mail.  If you wish<br>
to stay anonymous, you can come up with a name, such as "manager" or<br>
"investor".  Just make sure all the addresses are CORRECT, please.<br>
<p>
          LET ME TELL YOU WHY THIS SYSTEM WORKS!!!!<br>
<p>
Out of every 200 postings, let's say I ONLY receive 5 replies, which is<br>
actually VERY LOW.  So I made 5 dollars with my name at #5.  Now then,<br>
each person who just sent me $1 makes, say only 200 postings, now with<br>
your name at number 4, WHICH IS A TOTAL OF 1000 POSTINGS, not including<br>
yours too.  50 people send you $1 now; thats $50 you just made!  Now,<br>
then your new 50 agents post 200 each with YOUR NAME AT NUMBER 3, OR<br>
10,000 POSTING (50X200).  Average return is 500 at $1 each is $500.<br>
They make 200 postings each with your name at number 2, which is 100,000<br>
postings, which is 5,000 returns at $1 each, which is $5,000 dollars!<br>
And finally, 5,000 people make 200 postings each with YOUR NAME AT<br>
NUMBER 1.  YOU NOW GET A RETURN OF $50,000 BEFORE YOUR NAME DROPS OFF<br>
THE LIST.  AND THAT'S IF EVERYONE MAKES 200 POSTINGS ONLY, AND IF ONLY 5<br>
PERSONS RESPOND!!!!!<br>
<p>
        When your name is no longer on the list, you just take the<br>
latest posting that is appearing in the newgroups, and SEND OUT ANOTHER<br>
$5 TO THE NAMES ON THE LIST, PUTTING YOUR NAME AT NUMBER 5 AGAIN.  And<br>
start posting again.  The thing to remember is, do you realize that<br>
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE JOING THE INTERNET AND<br>
READING THESE ARTICLES EVERYDAY, JUST LIKE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW!!! So can <br>
you afford $5 dollars and see if it really works?  I think so.....<br>
<p>
        People have said, "what if the plan is played out and no one<br>
sends you the money?  So what!  What are the chances of that happening<br>
when there are TONS OF NEW HONEST USERS AND NEW HONEST PEOPLE who are<br>
joining the Internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it<br>
a try? Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day, with<br>
THOUSANDS of those joining the actual Internet.  Remember, play FAIRLY<br>
and HONESTLY and this WILL WORK, I PROMISE YOU!!!  You just have to be<br>
honest.  Make sure you print this article out RIGHT NOW, also.  Try to<br>
keep a list of everyone that sends you money and always keep an eye on<br>
the newgroups to make sure everyone is playing fairly.  REMEMBER,<br>
HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY.  YOU DON'T NEED TO CHEAT THE BASIC IDEA TO<br>
MAKE THE MONEY!!  GOOD LUCK TO ALL AND PLEASE PLAY FAIRLY AND YOU WILL<br>
REAP THE HUGE REWARDS FROM THIS, WHICH IS TONS OF EXTRA CASH.<br>
<p>
        ** By the way, if you try to decieve people by posting the<br>
messages with your name in the list and not sending the money to the<br>
people already on the list, you will not get as much.  Someone I talked<br>
to knew someone who did that and he only made about $150 dollars, and<br>
that's AFTER seven or eight weeks!  Then he sent the 5 $1 bills, people<br>
added him to their lists, and in 4-5 weeks, he had over $10K.<br>
<p>
THIS IS THE FAIREST AND MOST HONEST WAY I HAVE EVER SEEN TO SHARE THE<br>
WEALTH OF THE WORLD WITHOUT COSTING ANYTHING BUT OUR TIME!!!<br>
