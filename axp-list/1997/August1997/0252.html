I'm hoping to get Red Hat 4.2 installed on an AlphaStation 200 4/233, but<br>
have run into a number of rather nasty problems:<br>
<p>
According to the manual, the system should have either ARC or SRM firmware<br>
in 512K of flashROM.  When I first turned on the system, I did get the ARC<br>
console...but wasted no time in messing things up in such a way that now<br>
when I turn things on, after the "BIOS Emulation" messages and stuff I just<br>
get a blue screen.  Frozen.  However, if I boot with the keyboard<br>
disconnected, then after a minute or so it complains and reverts to console<br>
output on the serial port...running the SRM console.  Go figure.  On a whim<br>
I tried running the firmware update software from floppy...it reports the<br>
presence of 1 meg of flashROM and proceeds to update both ARC _and_ SRM.<br>
I'm really not picky...whatever it takes to get Linux started, that's<br>
fine...but I'd just like at least ONE of them to work properly at start-up,<br>
keyboard attached or otherwise.  Any ideas?<br>
<p>
My Red Hat 4.2 CD doesn't arrive until tomorrow at best, so I've been<br>
fiddling around with some of the boot disk images in the meantime...but<br>
can't seem to get any one of them to work.  Tried avanti.img, avanti-s, and<br>
XL.  I forget which one eventually started doing something other than<br>
freezing (avanti-s, I'm assuming, since I was in the SRM console*), but<br>
even with that one, the farthest along it got was to a seemingly infinite<br>
loop of "SCSI bus reset" messages.  I found a reference to this error among<br>
the archive but no resolution to it.<br>
<p>
* And then at this point, console I/O switches back to the monitor and<br>
keyboard...which had to be detached to get SRM started.  Argv!<br>
<p>
Finally...assuming I DO eventually get this all installed and running...one<br>
of the tasks I have in mind for the system is IP masquerading.  I'll need<br>
to add a network card for a second 10Base-T port...just wondering if there<br>
are any recommendations or compatibility issues to be aware of, or if<br>
something like the $20 no-name special will work.  Both an ISA and a PCI<br>
slot are free, so whatever is required or people think is best, there's<br>
room.  I'm sorta new to this whole thing, so any pointers, clues, or<br>
words-o-wisdom would be immensely appreciated.  Thanks much!<br>
