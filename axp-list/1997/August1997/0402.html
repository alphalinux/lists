<i>&gt; THIS IS THE FAIREST MOST HONEST WAY I KNOW OF TO SHARE THE WEALTH!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hello!  Would you like to make thousands of dollars, quickly, legally,</i><br>
<i>&gt; with NO CATCH?  Then keep reading....please take five minutes to read</i><br>
<i>&gt; this article it will change your life, just like it did mine.  It's</i><br>
<i>&gt; true!  You can make up to or over $50,000 dollars in 4-6 weeks, maybe</i><br>
<i>&gt; sooner!  I SWEAR I'M NOT LYING TO YOU, AND THIS IS NOT A SCAM!  If</i><br>
<i>&gt; you're interested, keep reading; if you're not, I apologize for </i><br>
<i>&gt; wasting your time.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         Here we go.  A little while back, I was browsing through these</i><br>
<i>&gt; newsgroups, just as you are now, and came across an article similar to</i><br>
<i>&gt; this that said you could make thousands of dollars in weeks with only an</i><br>
<i>&gt; initial investment of $5!  So, I thought, "Yeah, right, must be a scam",</i><br>
<i>&gt; but I was curious, like most of us, so I kept reading.  Anyway, it said</i><br>
<i>&gt; that you send $1 to each of the 5 names and addresses stated in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; article.  You then place your own name and address in the article at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; bottom of the list at #5, and post the article in at least 200</i><br>
<i>&gt; newsgroups (there are thousands).  No catch, that was it!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         So after thinking it over, talking to a few people first, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; tried it. I figured what have I got to lose except for 5 stamps and $5,</i><br>
<i>&gt; right? Well, guess what...within 7 days, I started getting money in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; mail! I was shocked!  I still figured it would end soon, and didn't give</i><br>
<i>&gt; it another thought.  But then the money kept coming IN, tripling in size</i><br>
<i>&gt; and multiplying by 10-20 times the amount that I got the first week!  In</i><br>
<i>&gt; my first week, I made about 20 to 30 dollars.  But by the end of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; second week, I had a mad total of over $1,000 dollars!!!! In the third</i><br>
<i>&gt; week, I had over $10,000 dollars, and it's still growing.  This is now</i><br>
<i>&gt; my fourth week (Oct 11) and I've made about $42,000 TOTAL, and the money</i><br>
<i>&gt; is STILL coming in.....</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ***This is the good news for the author of this article, this is not my</i><br>
<i>&gt; history.  I am just now (Jan 7, 97) posting this article. When I start</i><br>
<i>&gt; receiving money I will update this article and inform all of my good</i><br>
<i>&gt; fortune. I am not going to lie to you, I am giving it a shot and I think</i><br>
<i>&gt; you should too. Hey, it's certainly worth five bucks. We spend that on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the lottery.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, WHY it</i><br>
<i>&gt; works...also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so you can</i><br>
<i>&gt; get the information off of it, and begin making money. (Also, you can </i><br>
<i>&gt; save</i><br>
<i>&gt; this article, Using "FILE: Save as", or Marking whole article and coping </i><br>
<i>&gt; it </i><br>
<i>&gt; to clipboard)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         The process is very simple, and it consists of 3 EASY steps:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; STEP 1:  Get 5 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each</i><br>
<i>&gt; sheet of paper..."PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST.  YOU ARE NUMBER</i><br>
<i>&gt; 4."  Get five $1 bills and place ONE inside each piece of paper that you</i><br>
<i>&gt; just wrote on, and fold each piece of paper so the bill will not be seen</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the envelope (otherwise, nosey people who like to steal envelopes</i><br>
<i>&gt; with money in it will get yours).  Put one paper inside the envelope and</i><br>
<i>&gt; seal it.  Do the same for all 5.  You should now have 5 envelopes</i><br>
<i>&gt; sealed, EACH have a piece of paper AND a $1 bill stuffed inside of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; paper.  Make sure those words that were stated above are stated on each</i><br>
<i>&gt; peper.  What you are doing is creating a service by this, this is</i><br>
<i>&gt; PERFECTLY LEGAL.  Now then, mail the 5 envelopes with paper and $1 in</i><br>
<i>&gt; each to the following 5 addresses:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  1.Joshua Hart</i><br>
<i>&gt;     l350 du Fort, Apt.301</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Montreal, Quebec H3H 2R7</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Canada</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt;     1305 Fontenot St</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Mamou, La 70554</i><br>
<i>&gt;     U. S. A</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 3.  Dustin Gross</i><br>
<i>&gt;     13625 26th Place south</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Seattle, Wa 98168</i><br>
<i>&gt;     U. S. A.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt;     Hakkin-Cho 1-20</i><br>

<i>&gt;     Portland, OR 97223</i><br>
<i>&gt;     USA</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; STEP 2:  Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the</i><br>
<i>&gt; other 4 names up (5 becomes 4, 4 becomes 3, etc.) and put YOUR NAME as</i><br>
<i>&gt; number 5 on the list.  You can slightly alter this article if you need</i><br>
<i>&gt; to, editing what YOU need to edit.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; STEP 3:  Post your amended article (with your name at #5) to at least</i><br>
<i>&gt; 200 news groups (I think there's close to 18,000 of them).  All you need</i><br>
<i>&gt; is say, at least 200.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Extra Section:</i><br>
<i>&gt; HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS FAST:</i><br>
<i>&gt; If you have Netscape 3.0 do EXACTLY  the following:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1)  Click on any news group like normal, THEN click on 'TO NEWS', which</i><br>
<i>&gt; is on the far left when you're in the newsgroups page.  This will bring</i><br>
<i>&gt; up a box to type a message in.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2)  Leave the newsgroup box like it is, CHANGE the subject box to</i><br>
<i>&gt; something flashy, like, "NEED CASH $$$  READ HERE $$$" or "FAST CASH"!!!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 3)  Tab once and you should be ready to type.  Now, retype (only once)</i><br>
<i>&gt; THIS whole article WORD FOR WORD, except to insert your name at #5, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; to remove #1 off the list, plus any other small change you think you</i><br>
<i>&gt; need to make.  Keep almost all of it the SAME!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 4)  When you're done typing the WHOLE article, click on FILE in THIS</i><br>
<i>&gt; BOX, RIGHT ABOVE SEND, NOT WHERE IT SAYS NETSCAPE NEWS ON THE FIRST BOX.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Click on SAVE AS when you're under FILE.  Save your article as a text</i><br>
<i>&gt; file to your C: or A: drive.  DO NOT SEND OR POST YOUR ARTICLE UNTIL YOU</i><br>
<i>&gt; DO THIS.  Once saved, move on to number 5 below. (Shortcut: If you have </i><br>
<i>&gt; saved this file or copied it to the clipboard, you just need to retrieve </i><br>
<i>&gt; or copy it to your composition window. After modifications done, save it)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 5)  If you still have all of your text, send or post to this newsgroup</i><br>
<i>&gt; now by just clicking send, which is right below FILE, and right above</i><br>
<i>&gt; Cc:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 6)  Here's where you're going to post all 200.  OK, click on any news</i><br>
<i>&gt; group then click on 'To News', again in the top left corner.  Leave the</i><br>
<i>&gt; NEWSGROUPS BOX alone again, put a flashy subject title in the SUBJECT</i><br>
<i>&gt; BOX, hit TAB once so you're in the body of the message, and then click</i><br>
<i>&gt; on ATTACHMENTS, which is below the SUBJECT BOX.  You will get another</i><br>
<i>&gt; box to come up.  Click on ATTACH FILE, then find YOUR file that you</i><br>
<i>&gt; saved; click once on the file, and then click OPEN; now click on OK; if</i><br>
<i>&gt; you did this right, you should see your file name in the attachments</i><br>
<i>&gt; box, and it will be shaded green.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; IF YOU USE IE EXPLORER IT'S JUST AS EASY...HOLDING DOWN THE LEFT MOUSE</i><br>
<i>&gt; BUTTON, HIGHLIGHT THIS ARTICLE. THEN PRESS THE "CTRL" KEY AND THE "C"</i><br>
<i>&gt; KEY AT THE SAME TIME TO COPY THE ARTICLE.  THEN PRINT THIS ARTICLE FOR</i><br>
<i>&gt; YOUR RECORDS TO HAVE THE NAMES OF THOSE YOU WILL BE SENDING $1 BILLS TO.</i><br>
<i>&gt; NEXT, GO TO THE NEWS GROUPS AND PRESS "POST AN ARTICLE"  A WINDOW WILL</i><br>
<i>&gt; OPEN. TYPE IN YOUR HEADLINE IN THE SUBJECT AREA AND THEN CLICK IN THE</i><br>
<i>&gt; LARGE WINDOW BELOW.  PRESS "CTRL" AND THEN "V" AND THE ARTICLE WILL BE</i><br>
<i>&gt; PLACED IN THE WINDOW.  IF YOU WANT TO EDIT THE ARTICLE, DO SO AND THEN</i><br>
<i>&gt; HIGHTLIGHT AND COPY IT AGAIN. NOW EVERYTIME YOU POST THE ARTICLE IN A</i><br>
<i>&gt; NEW NEWSGROUP ALL YOU HAVE TO REPEAT "CTRL" AND "V" AND PRESS POST.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 7)  That's it.  Each time you do this, all you have to do is type in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; different newsgroup, so that way, it posts to 200 DIFFERENT newsgroups,</i><br>
<i>&gt; you see?  Now you just have 199 to go!! (Don't worry, each one takes</i><br>
<i>&gt; about 30 seconds, once you get used to it)  REMEMBER 200 IS A MINIMUM.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The more you post to, the more money you will make.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; AND THAT'S IT!!!  THAT'S THE ONLY 3 STEPS THERE IS!!!!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You are now in the mail order business and will start receiving your $1</i><br>
<i>&gt; envelopes from various people all over the world within days.  HINT:</i><br>
<i>&gt; THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST TO, THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE.  You may</i><br>
<i>&gt; want to rent a PO Box eventually because of all the mail.  If you wish</i><br>
<i>&gt; to stay anonymous, you can come up with a name, such as "manager" or</i><br>
<i>&gt; "investor".  Just make sure all the addresses are CORRECT, please.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;           LET ME TELL YOU WHY THIS SYSTEM WORKS!!!!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Out of every 200 postings, let's say I ONLY receive 5 replies, which is</i><br>
<i>&gt; actually VERY LOW.  So I made 5 dollars with my name at #5.  Now then,</i><br>
<i>&gt; each person who just sent me $1 makes, say only 200 postings, now with</i><br>
<i>&gt; your name at number 4, WHICH IS A TOTAL OF 1000 POSTINGS, not including</i><br>
<i>&gt; yours too.  50 people send you $1 now; thats $50 you just made!  Now,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then your new 50 agents post 200 each with YOUR NAME AT NUMBER 3, OR</i><br>
<i>&gt; 10,000 POSTING (50X200).  Average return is 500 at $1 each is $500.</i><br>
<i>&gt; They make 200 postings each with your name at number 2, which is 100,000</i><br>
<i>&gt; postings, which is 5,000 returns at $1 each, which is $5,000 dollars!</i><br>
<i>&gt; And finally, 5,000 people make 200 postings each with YOUR NAME AT</i><br>
<i>&gt; NUMBER 1.  YOU NOW GET A RETURN OF $50,000 BEFORE YOUR NAME DROPS OFF</i><br>
<i>&gt; THE LIST.  AND THAT'S IF EVERYONE MAKES 200 POSTINGS ONLY, AND IF ONLY 5</i><br>
<i>&gt; PERSONS RESPOND!!!!!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         When your name is no longer on the list, you just take the</i><br>
<i>&gt; latest posting that is appearing in the newgroups, and SEND OUT ANOTHER</i><br>
<i>&gt; $5 TO THE NAMES ON THE LIST, PUTTING YOUR NAME AT NUMBER 5 AGAIN.  And</i><br>
<i>&gt; start posting again.  The thing to remember is, do you realize that</i><br>
<i>&gt; THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE JOING THE INTERNET AND</i><br>
<i>&gt; READING THESE ARTICLES EVERYDAY, JUST LIKE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW!!! So can </i><br>
<i>&gt; you afford $5 dollars and see if it really works?  I think so.....</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         People have said, "what if the plan is played out and no one</i><br>
<i>&gt; sends you the money?  So what!  What are the chances of that happening</i><br>
<i>&gt; when there are TONS OF NEW HONEST USERS AND NEW HONEST PEOPLE who are</i><br>
<i>&gt; joining the Internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it</i><br>
<i>&gt; a try? Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day, with</i><br>
<i>&gt; THOUSANDS of those joining the actual Internet.  Remember, play FAIRLY</i><br>
<i>&gt; and HONESTLY and this WILL WORK, I PROMISE YOU!!!  You just have to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; honest.  Make sure you print this article out RIGHT NOW, also.  Try to</i><br>
<i>&gt; keep a list of everyone that sends you money and always keep an eye on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the newgroups to make sure everyone is playing fairly.  REMEMBER,</i><br>
<i>&gt; HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY.  YOU DON'T NEED TO CHEAT THE BASIC IDEA TO</i><br>
<i>&gt; MAKE THE MONEY!!  GOOD LUCK TO ALL AND PLEASE PLAY FAIRLY AND YOU WILL</i><br>
<i>&gt; REAP THE HUGE REWARDS FROM THIS, WHICH IS TONS OF EXTRA CASH.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         ** By the way, if you try to decieve people by posting the</i><br>
<i>&gt; messages with your name in the list and not sending the money to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; people already on the list, you will not get as much.  Someone I talked</i><br>
<i>&gt; to knew someone who did that and he only made about $150 dollars, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; that's AFTER seven or eight weeks!  Then he sent the 5 $1 bills, people</i><br>
<i>&gt; added him to their lists, and in 4-5 weeks, he had over $10K.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; THIS IS THE FAIREST AND MOST HONEST WAY I HAVE EVER SEEN TO SHARE THE</i><br>
<i>&gt; WEALTH OF THE WORLD WITHOUT COSTING ANYTHING BUT OUR TIME!!!</i><br>
