Heaping shovel-fuls of gratitude to the folks who helped me get my<br>
AlphaStation back in order.  I had fiddled with some firmware settings<br>
under the (mistaken) impression that this particular machine had Digital<br>
UNIX pre-installed (is it true these License PAKs are worth their weight in<br>
gold? ;)  Anyway...up and running with Linux now, much happier.<br>
<p>
I ran into another problem shortly after that.  The "XL" MILO images didn't<br>
seem to work on this system as they should (AS 200 4/100, upgraded to 233<br>
MHz*, and with #9FX Vision 300 card installed).  It would either hang or<br>
reboot at the "Switching to PALcode..." message,  I eventually got it to<br>
work by replacing the milo file with one found at:<br>
<p>
<a href="ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/Miniloader/v2.0/2.0.22/XL-avanti/">ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/Miniloader/v2.0/2.0.22/XL-avanti/</a><br>
<p>
* About this upgrade thing: the replacement CPU appears to be a 275 MHz<br>
unit...I'm wondering if this can be run at 266 MHz with a suitable crystal,<br>
or if something in the AS200 design intrinsically limits the maximum speed<br>
to 233 MHz.  Any ideas?  And if it's possible, where exactly would one find<br>
the appropriate crystal?<br>
<p>
A couple of suggestions for...whoever takes care of these things: maybe<br>
it's obvious to the more seasoned users, but it's only hinted at in a<br>
couple of sentences in an appendix that MILO can be installed in a small<br>
DOS partition rather than requiring a boot floppy every time.  Also, I was<br>
a bit confused by the /images and /milo/images directories at first, what<br>
with the common filenames within and such...granted, nothing a little<br>
RTFM'ing wasn't able to clear up, but perhaps there could be some different<br>
naming convention for boot and MILO images to make this more apparent and<br>
to eliminate the need to rename one or the other when trying to download<br>
both into a common directory.<br>
<p>
Finally...if anyone has built their own kernel on a system with a similar<br>
configuration, I would be interested in seeing the settings you used, as I<br>
have been unable to build one that works so far.  I _think_ maybe it's<br>
having a conniption over the second Ethernet card I added (PCI, Realtek<br>
chipset, NE2000), complaining about it being in "nonexistent slot #0"<br>
(though the original kernel from the Avanti disk doesn't complain)...but<br>
there are many other fiddly bits and settings that I'm unsure of,<br>
particularly among the SCSI low-level drivers (which fails to even compile,<br>
BTW, unless I select "Omit FlashPoint support").  Oh yes, and I was<br>
wondering whether any of the sound support settings are viable on this<br>
system.<br>
<p>
Thanks much for any pointers!<br>
