    we are having difficulty with our new alpha based system which is<br>
intended to run linux.  following is the system configuration:<br>
<p>
DEC Alpha 21164A-500MHz CPU<br>
PCI bus<br>
IBM 4GB Ultra Wide SCSI 34330<br>
Diamond Stealth64 S3-chip Trio64 PCI-2MB video card<br>
Redhat linux 4.2<br>
*NCR scsi controller model identified as ncr53c810<br>
<p>
*indicates what we believe to be the cause of our problems<br>
<p>
following description of problem:<br>
we received the machine and started the linux os in the console mode.<br>
then as any new user might attempt we tried to start the x environment<br>
while logged on as root.<br>
#startx - this is what we typed<br>
it locked up the system and we felt forced to hit the reset button.<br>
this turned out to be a more serious problem.  while rebooting the<br>
system noted that the filesystem had not been unmounted cleanly and<br>
forced a file system check.  when this happened we got something like:<br>
"<br>
oscript cmd=89030000<br>
oreg.o da 10 80 13 47 08 00 1f 03 01 80 21 00 01 71 00<br>
ncr53c810-o:  have to clear fifos<br>
ncr53c810-o:  restart (fatal error)<br>
ncr53c810-o - &lt;target 0, lun 0&gt;:<br>
    command failed (9ff)<br>
    @fffc000068a820<br>
"<br>
****then this sequence is repeated forever or until we got sick!!! of<br>
looking at it***<br>
<p>
our filesystem looked something like:<br>
/dev/sda1    dos partition holding necessary files<br>
/dev/sda2    root partition i.e. / ***this is where we got the failure<br>
/dev/sda3    swap partition i.e. linux swap<br>
/dev/sda4    /usr/users partition i.e. linux native like root<br>
<p>
we tried the following:<br>
1. left with no other choice we tried to reinstall linux from cd media<br>
provided by the mfg.<br>
2. at first few attempts this failed because it could not format the<br>
partitions or from what we could see just hung there<br>
3.  we finally did get the os to install once for an unknown reason (yes<br>
we really do mean "unknown" since the only thing we did differently was<br>
to turn the machine off for a brief i.e. 5min period and this doesn't<br>
seem relevant)<br>
4.  when we overcame our state of joy and excitement we once again tried<br>
to get x env. to start up under a root login and it hung up.  after many<br>
explicatives uttered by one of the chinese students and myself we once<br>
again pressed the reset button and the same process began over again<br>
<p>
** when i say the same process i am referring to the sequence of lines i<br>
typed earlier which included the "ncr53c810-o" reference**<br>
<p>
finally a summary question:<br>
we are wondering if all of our trouble stems from the use of this<br>
particular ncr controller.  we would not have any problem approaching<br>
our supplier for another card is this can be identified as the problem<br>
as power outages may very well lead to this same situation, and needless<br>
to say we can't afford to reinstall the machine each time.  that is if<br>
we can even get the thing to install consistently for us.  has anyone<br>
else experienced problems with this scsi controller and alpha<br>
motherboard with linux installed?<br>
<p>
we did check the web and this list also for past problems and others<br>
have reported strange problems when it came to the ncr scsi controllers.<br>
<p>
thanks for any assistance,<br>
