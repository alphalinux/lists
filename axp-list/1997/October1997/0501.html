well i thought i would keep you posted on my problems...<br>
<p>
recap:  <br>
	<br>
	i have an axppci33 system that i put together and it appears<br>
	to run just fine from the console but when i start up X i get<br>
	hard lockups and 'strange' errors approximately 10 minutes <br>
	after X gets up...<br>
<p>
now, it WAS overclocked to 200mhz but since then i have downclocked<br>
to the original 166mhz and still recieve the same error conditions<br>
<p>
i have also rm -rf / and installed a fresh redhat 4.2 with X 3.2<br>
and all... upon starting up X for the first time under these new<br>
circumstances things seemed ok... then about 20 seconds into X'ing<br>
my friend Mr. Hard Lockup appears... :(  ...one thing thats<br>
interesting about this new configuration is that when X starts up<br>
and the familar thatch background appears it is slowly painted from<br>
top to bottom and takes around 4 seconds to pain the screen rather<br>
than the usual 1 second... also my logs do not record ANYTHING that<br>
seems related to the lockups under these new conditions...<br>
<p>
as i write this i am compiling XFree86 3.3.1 and i will try that<br>
along with this brand new redhat installation... if this fails<br>
then i will begin to try to find hardware to switch out with...<br>
first thing i'll try will probably be another hard drive, then<br>
if i can find another video card i'll try that...<br>
<p>
<p>
oh yeah, another thing, from the beginning this has appeared to be<br>
an X-only problem but i found something else!  <br>
<p>
# badblocks /dev/sda1 82615<br>
<p>
causes an Oops, and a seg fault from the standard console, from<br>
a fresh install, so i am now not so sure it is an X-only thing...<br>
<p>
here is a transcript of what happens with badblocks...<br>
<p>
hehe... guess what... i paused here so that i could go a head and<br>
log what badblocks normally does to oops and seg fault so that i<br>
could just paste it in here but after around 10 seconds after i <br>
fired badblocks up the machine just automatically rebooted... right <br>
in the middle of a build of XFree86 3.3.1<br>
<p>
as you can see i am getting kinda desperate for suggestions here...<br>
<p>
thanks<br>
