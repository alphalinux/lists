Roman Martonak:<br>
<i>&gt;I would like to move it to the external one. My question is whether it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;enough just to partition the new disk and copy the whole linux filesystem </i><br>
<i>&gt;onto it, or whether the symbol /dev/sda of the internal disk is coded somewhere</i><br>
<p>
I don't see any problems, I do this all the time on Intel boxes. A 'cp -axv' excluding<br>
things like /proc and amd-mounted filesystems works for me. Absolutely easiest way<br>
to set up a new Linux. The only trouble is that after the cp, I have to mount the new drive as<br>
primary master, boot from floppy with the new drive as root and then running LILO,<br>
but of course this procedure is a little bit different on Alphas and SCSI...<br>
<p>
By the way, running a big 'cp' like that on my Alpha is a sure way to kill the system,<br>
I have to run the cp on another system with the Alpha NFS-mounted. Something is sure messed<br>
up in NFS or even more likely the IDE-driver on a LX. <br>
<p>
We had a small discussion on the CMD chipset (actually more like questions without answers) <br>
before, and I (or collegues) have found that the CMD chipset isn't even recognized by the <br>
drivers, even though it should be. The IDE-driver works anyway as it defaults to standard ATA<br>
interface, but that means that nice (essential) things like DMA cannot be configured.<br>
Don't know if this has something to do with the fact that the clock goes a couple of<br>
times faster when the drive settings are altered with 'hdparm', but perhaps not<br>
at all unlikely. Unfortunately I don't have time for some invigorating Linux hacking<br>
right now, so if someone would like to delve in to this problem, please do.<br>
The IDE speed on the LX is very disappointing, a couple of times slower than <br>
Intel boxes... Depressing... Of course this had nothing to do with copying of Linux<br>
drives, just thought I should mention it anyway.<br>
