greetings folks,<br>
<p>
i know a lot of you may be shocked/disappointed/(fill in the blank) at<br>
the recent news about the alliance, but take a moment and consider my<br>
observation.<br>
<p>
digital gave us an opportunity to learn about 64bit architecture. (imo)<br>
their engineers are some of the best on the planet.  the 'buck' doesn't<br>
stop with 64 bits.  there will be greater architecture and i'd put my<br>
money on digital to hold up the forefront of this kind of development<br>
and (smile) look forward to working with 128/256/512-bit linux.<br>
<p>
if you want to talk about disappointment, i can ramble for hours, but<br>
(smile) will spare you by giving one example: the day 'big blue' took<br>
out 'cp/m' (chuckle - please, no religious wars).<br>
<p>
in most cases, i have shrugged off my disappointment and moved on.<br>
<p>
although, perhaps unrelated, i want to share a note i sent as a reply to <br>
some questions raised, on this list, by <a href="mailto:alvin@iplink.net">alvin@iplink.net</a>, 18 sep 1997, <br>
and try to swing this thread back to linux.<br>

hi alvin,
<p>
&gt; 1) Linux is a fringe OS.
<p>
yup, it sure is, and i believe it is called "forefront"/"cutting edge"! 
(chuckle) most folks don't have a clue as to how advanced linux (in its
infancy) is, what posix is, how standards could have built a better 
cyberspace, or care. all they want is their application to work with
ease and without having to read a manual; (snicker) but then again, i'm 
not sure my thoughts would count, just by the fact i participate on the 
axp-list and we are (smile) certainly not like the majority, (chuckle) 
yet. 
<p>
&gt; 2) Linux is not used for real appilcatioins.
<p>
(smile) it depends on who is defining real.  you and i know real things
can be done under/with linux using all those great gnu tools.  i believe
the folks who would say #2) would change their mind _if_ a number of 
major companies would port some of their software to linux/alpha _and_ 
be able to show a $_profit_$.  (imo) people get confused with FREE and 
"you get what you pay for".
<p>
&gt; 3) Linux users/developers will not pay money for 3rd party products.
<p>
this is a tough one.  i purchased quake and just found another company
(linux/alpha based) who has a product or two i want.  (chuckle) do my 
15+/- linux cdroms count?  i'm willing to purchase products that make my 
life easier and save time.
<p>
&gt; Is there any way to raise the visibility of Linux to the people at DEC
<p>
i, for one, believe dec has a visible eye on linux and will profit from
it, in the long run.  when dec gave linus an alpha and later placed the 
multia/udbs' on the "mature" list a lot of folks grabbed them up because 
they ran linux.  the bonus was learning 64bit architecture in advance of 
the rest of the computing world at a very meager $ entry. when the intel
"merced" finally makes it to the surface, the rest of the 32bit world 
(although great for secure/firewall/crypto `frontends' (smile)) will go 
away like the s-100 bus and "here" will be a "pool" of 64bit hackers 
with 4 +/- years of experience - or more, if you were lucky enough to 
have-access-to a osf/du license.  as others have stated, the future will 
probably have nt and unix and (imo) the folks weaned on emacs, minix, 
bsd, and linux will help perserve unix as an os (smile) [commercial
unices elided due to lengthy trademark ackowledgement].
<p>
one way to raise visibility would be to develop a native alpha (`fill in 
this space') `game' that would make oem (`fill in this space') `gamers' 
drool! ...remember, there will probably be 64bit linux/intel (smile) to 
make the short story long.
<p>
the only thing i have asked dec to consider is provide a hobby class
license for du (home use - no commercial application) like they have for
vms or provide some libraries for our linux allies at dec to use without
restriction.
