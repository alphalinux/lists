Hmmm...rules out that problem....unless there's some permanent damage<br>
already done to the CPU (doubtful).<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; than the usual 1 second... also my logs do not record ANYTHING that</i><br>
<i>&gt; seems related to the lockups under these new conditions...</i><br>
<p>
Which X server are you using?  I seem to remember you mentioning that the<br>
card is an S3-ViRGE based card, correct?  If so, are you using the s3<br>
server or the s3v server?  The latter should be the one that you use.  Use<br>
of the standard s3 server on ViRGE cards had been known to cause problems<br>
in the early days of the ViRGE chips, so I would suspect it's still the<br>
case.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; as i write this i am compiling XFree86 3.3.1 and i will try that</i><br>

<i>&gt; first thing i'll try will probably be another hard drive, then</i><br>
<i>&gt; if i can find another video card i'll try that...</i><br>
<p>
I'm also recompiling XFree86 3.3.1 under Debian on my UDB.  Actually, I<br>
have it compiled now and am in the process of packaging it.  I would<br>
highly suggest swapping video cards first since X is an obvious lock-up<br>
point for you.  After that, you can deal with the hard drive situation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; oh yeah, another thing, from the beginning this has appeared to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; an X-only problem but i found something else!  </i><br>
<i>&gt; # badblocks /dev/sda1 82615</i><br>
<i>&gt; causes an Oops, and a seg fault from the standard console, from</i><br>
<i>&gt; a fresh install, so i am now not so sure it is an X-only thing...</i><br>
<p>
There has been an ongoing discussion of just how well some of the disk<br>
tools have been working lately on several of the Debian mailing lists with<br>
particular attention being paid to the e2fs tools/progs (which badblocks<br>
comes from).  It appears that not all of the tools work as advertised<br>
under glibc even on the x86's.  Honestly, I haven't run it on my UDB, but<br>
I will try and see what happens :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; hehe... guess what... i paused here so that i could go a head and</i><br>
<i>&gt; log what badblocks normally does to oops and seg fault so that i</i><br>
<i>&gt; could just paste it in here but after around 10 seconds after i </i><br>
<i>&gt; fired badblocks up the machine just automatically rebooted... right </i><br>
<i>&gt; in the middle of a build of XFree86 3.3.1</i><br>
<i>&gt; as you can see i am getting kinda desperate for suggestions here...</i><br>
<p>
Eek!  Yeah, I can see why.... :P<br>
