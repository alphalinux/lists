Hi!<br>
<p>
I just entered the Linux/Alpha universe and now I'm in the process<br>
of trying and learning.<br>
I have a PC164LX with a 600MHZ 21164 CPU, 128MB RAM, IntraServer<br>
3140U Fast Wide SCSI Controller and Fast-Wide SCSI harddisks and<br>
some other goodies.<br>
So far this system is very powerful and works quite well - if it works<br>
at all...<br>
<p>
The PC164LX seems to be very new, so Linux (and software tools like<br>
MILO) still have some problems:<br>
<p>
1.) Originally the system came with AlphaBIOS 5.60-3, and MILO couldn't<br>
    boot Linux at all (to be correct: MILO_LX) - it just hung after <br>
    some SCSI controller startup messages.<br>
    I then downgraded to AlphaBIOS 5.60, and MILO_LX was then able to <br>
    boot Linux, but sometimes (I would say 1 out of 5 times) it still <br>
    just hangs.<br>
    This seems to be a problem with NCR based SCSI controllers, I<br>
noticed<br>
    the same troubles with an NCR-based Tekram DC390, but with an<br>
Adaptec <br>
    2940UW it works fine.<br>
  <br>
    So my questions are: Is this a known problem? Is anyone working on<br>
    a solution to this? Any hints or patches to try?<br>
<p>
2.) The system looses time, the system clock just runs exactly half the <br>
    speed it should! For 60 seconds in "real time" the PC164LX counts <br>
    30 seconds! (This has an interesting side effect on benchmarks: I<br>
    got 1920000 Dhrystones/Sec, for instance  :-)<br>
<p>
    So I have the same question: Has anyone a solution to this problem?<br>
<p>
3.) I want to use Alpha-based Linux systems as file- and<br>
network-servers.<br>
    For that purpose the machines don't need keyboards attached, but<br>
when<br>
    I first tried booting without a keyboard, nothing happend, the<br>
screen<br>
    just remained dark, the system hung!<br>
    For a server this is not acceptable, and I can't believe the PC164LX<br>
    needs a keyboard to boot. Maybe it switches to some "serial console<br>
    mode" when it doesn't detect a keyboard, but I couldn't find any<br>
    documentation about it and the CMOS setup doesn't offer any option.<br>
<p>
    Can anyone comment on this topic, please?<br>
<p>
Well, that's it for the moment. Apart from the problems described above<br>
(some are quite serious, though), I'm quite happy with the PC164LX. <br>
I hope, with your help I can resolve the remainig problems so I can <br>
recommend Alpha-based Linux systems to my customers in the future.<br>
<p>
Thanx!<br>
<p>
- andreas<br>
