hi emilio,<br>
<p>
due to the constant requests for information regarding quake, i am<br>
cross-posting this to the axp-list,...besides, it's chilly up here on<br>
the mountain (where i live), this morning, and a few flames (chuckle) <br>
might warm me up - NOT.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; On the other hand, when i try running quake i get the following:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;From what i'm told this has to do with shared memory.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Is there a way to turn shared memory on or off.</i><br>
<p>
i'm not sure this is a ""verbatim"" "shared memory" problem (comments <br>
below).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Excuse the ignorance but i'm trying to learn Linux since i'm a VMS user</i><br>
<p>
(smile - learning is learning - and (imo) a good thing -  no problem)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; everything seems so confusing or non organized with UNIX that i'm having a</i><br>
<i>&gt; hard time getting this kind of detailed info.</i><br>
<p>
(chuckle) maybe a first step towards "chaO.S." programming.  seriously,<br>
this is why a lot of my old vms friends (i cut my teeth on an ibm360/20<br>
back in 1966 and have played with various os/programming over the years- <br>
smile) use nt (despite their (imo) "valid" opinions of ms - chuckle).  <br>
slowly, i am changing some of them to see the merits of what i consider <br>
to be the most advanced, experimental, "young" *nix os around, (smile) <br>
linux/alpha!<br>
<p>
(sidebar)  between my 266/udb and xlt300 (smile) i have incorporated <br>
so many bits and pieces of rh4.0/4.1/4.2/ (yup, i have all the cds') - <br>
milo 2.0.18 thru 2.0.31 - kernels 2.0.30 / 2.0.31 / 2.1.56 - em86 .1/.2, <br>
that i have (chuckle) given up on trying to define versions and libs. my <br>
only wish (smile - and i know what is said about wishing) is that i <br>
could run "rpm -Va" and not get any reports  -- JUST ONCE!  the same is<br>
true of source compilation -- JUST ONCE - "no warnings"..., but as they<br>
say, rome wasn't built in a day, so i have learned a lot about patience.<br>
if i haven't said it enough, "KUDOS" to the fine folks from dec and <br>
various linux orgs. who have consistently helped us. (soapbox mode off)<br>

<i>&gt; **********************QUAKE ERROR MESSAGE</i><br>
<i>&gt; **********************</i><br>

<i>&gt; Current serial number in output stream: 50</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; **********************QUAKE ERROR MESSAGE**********************</i><br>
<p>
(disclaimer)<br>
i have never played with an as200-4/166, so this is speculation and i <br>
have had "no problems" running xquake on my machines.  ((HOWEVER-BIG<br>
CHUCKLE) i would not advise running squake under em86 with a pnp sound<br>
card, unless you want to spend a week trying to figure out what happened<br>
to your sound.- whew!)<br>
<p>
things to try:<br>
<p>
start fresh:  mount your quake cdrom and copy resourse.1 to:<br>
/usr/games/quake  issue:  lha -x resource.1    get rid of everything<br>
in the directory, except the id1 directory and the files (pak) therein.<br>
unpack your xquake tarball in /usr/games/quake.<br>
<p>
issue:  strace ./alpha-ELF-xquake &gt; tracefile<br>
(take a look at tracefile to see what is happening when xquake fails)<br>
<p>
issue:  ./alpha-ELF-xquake -stdvid -safe<br>
<p>
valid parameters for this version are:  -nomouse -nojoy -nocdaudio<br>
-nolan -stdvid -safe -nosound -dedicated -listen (there are some others,<br>
but, i don't "think" they apply, "in this case").<br>
<p>
NOTE::: once you get it running (this does not apply to 106xquake --- <br>
only xquake) you have to go into the console and issue (as you see it):<br>
disconnect ; map start<br>
<p>
if "None of the Above" work, try this:<br>
<p>
ftp gatekeeper.dec.com<br>
ftp&gt; bin<br>
ftp&gt; tick<br>
ftp&gt; cd /pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/X11/<br>
ftp&gt; get axpbin-Xtga-BETA-0.2.gz<br>
ftp&gt; close<br>
ftp&gt; quit<br>
gunzip -d /usr/quake/axpbin-Xtga-BETA-0.2.gz<br>
mv /usr/X11R6/bin/XF86_TGA /usr/X11R6/bin/XF86_TGA.orig<br>
mv axpbin-Xtga-BETA-0.2 /usr/X11R6/bin/XF86_TGA<br>
then issue (in your quake directory):  ./alpha-ELF-xquake<br>
<p>
(note): don't forget to change back to your original XF86_TGA if this<br>
doesn't work.<br>
<p>
Stefan van der Eijk &lt;<a href="mailto:stefan@stack.nl">stefan@stack.nl</a>&gt; and John Ross Hunt &lt;hunt@lbpc.com&gt;<br>
had some good observations in their "Subject: RE: Quake" posts to the<br>
axp-list (29 &amp; 30 Sep 1977) and you might want to check them out.<br>
<p>
nm &lt;<a href="mailto:nmanisca@vt.edu">nmanisca@vt.edu</a>&gt; in a private note said:<br>
<i>&gt; well i got it working!!!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; turns out i read a post on a news group that led me to </i><br>
<i>&gt; the key...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; linus said his didnt work either so he released a fixed</i><br>
<i>&gt; one, which worked for me :)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; xquake-1.06-alpha-bin.gz :) &lt;this one works fine for me too - curtis&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
(moving right along):<br>
the "base" error messages (above) come from /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XErrorDB<br>
...so my first assumption is: check your X stuff.  i'm running the<br>
XFree86 3.3.1-1 rpms' on both of my machines.<br>
<p>
i do not have the quake source...(smile)...which doesn't make this easy.<br>
however, ("attempt to access private resource"), (guess only) may have<br>
something to do with  Xlib and a fail on quake's VID_Update, producing<br>
the X_ShmPutImage message.  if you take a look at:<br>
/usr/X11R6/include/X11/Xlib.h you will notice "Structures and symbols <br>
starting with "_" are private to the library." which (to me) might be a <br>
clue.<br>
<p>
"audio" - just to be safe check these ((pertinent to onboard MSS ONLY)):<br>
((may vary on different systems - "i don't know" - taken from my udb))<br>
<p>
take a look at /etc/soundconf (here's mine):<br>
#define CONFIG_MSS<br>
#define CONFIG_AD1848<br>
#define CONFIG_AUDIO<br>
#define MSS_BASE 0x530<br>
#define MSS_IRQ 9<br>
#define MSS_DMA 3<br>
#define SELECTED_SOUND_OPTIONS 0x00000200   <br>
<p>
cat /proc/devices     14 sound<br>
cat /proc/dma         3: Sound System<br>
cat /proc/interrupts  9: 111 SoundPort<br>
<p>
<pre>
--
on another note: do you have /etc/nsswitch.conf ?
<pre>
--
<p>
if you really want to get into it, you may also want to check with the:
X Consortium.
<p>
here's a good place to keep up with quake and linux (the links as well):
<p>
<a href="http://threewave.planetquake.com/linux/quake.html">http://threewave.planetquake.com/linux/quake.html</a>
<p>
it might be time to construct a linux/alpha xquake FAQ, which might be
a good addition for this (above) and other linux/quake sites.  i am too 
far behind on other projects to take this on myself (smile) volunteers?
<p>
....and don't forget to search the axp mail archives located at a number
of sites for old "quake/xquake" posts.
<p>
good luck n'very best2u all,
