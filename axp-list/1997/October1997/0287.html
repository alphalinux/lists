Hi!<br>
<p>
4 days ago I reported some problems I had with Linux on a AlphaPC 164LX<br>
motherboard. Now I seem to have solved these problems and as promised I<br>
report a short summary of how I got my system to work as expected.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1.) Originally the system came with AlphaBIOS 5.60-3, and MILO couldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;     boot Linux at all (to be correct: MILO_LX) - it just hung after</i><br>
<i>&gt;     some SCSI controller startup messages.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     I then downgraded to AlphaBIOS 5.60, and MILO_LX was then able to</i><br>
<i>&gt;     boot Linux, but sometimes (I would say 1 out of 5 times) it still</i><br>
<i>&gt;     just hangs.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     This seems to be a problem with NCR based SCSI controllers, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; noticed</i><br>
<i>&gt;     the same troubles with an NCR-based Tekram DC390, but with an</i><br>
<i>&gt; Adaptec</i><br>
<i>&gt;     2940UW it works fine.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     So my questions are: Is this a known problem? Is anyone working on</i><br>
<i>&gt;     a solution to this? Any hints or patches to try?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
This problem was solved when I got the MILO Jay Estabrook suggested in<br>
his reply. <br>
For the AlphaPC 164LX you have to use the following MILO:<br>
&lt;<a href="ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/Kernels/milo-2031-lx164">ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/Kernels/milo-2031-lx164</a>&gt;<br>
(file size: 404105 bytes, file date: 06-Aug-97, 14:37:00)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2.) The system looses time, the system clock just runs exactly half the</i><br>
<i>&gt;     speed it should! For 60 seconds in "real time" the PC164LX counts</i><br>
<i>&gt;     30 seconds! (This has an interesting side effect on benchmarks: I</i><br>
<i>&gt;     got 1920000 Dhrystones/Sec, for instance  :-)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     So I have the same question: Has anyone a solution to this problem?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
This problem also was solved using the new MILO.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; 3.) I want to use Alpha-based Linux systems as file- and</i><br>
<i>&gt; network-servers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     For that purpose the machines don't need keyboards attached, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; when</i><br>
<i>&gt;     I first tried booting without a keyboard, nothing happend, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; screen</i><br>
<i>&gt;     just remained dark, the system hung!</i><br>
<i>&gt;     For a server this is not acceptable, and I can't believe the PC164LX</i><br>
<i>&gt;     needs a keyboard to boot. Maybe it switches to some "serial console</i><br>
<i>&gt;     mode" when it doesn't detect a keyboard, but I couldn't find any</i><br>
<i>&gt;     documentation about it and the CMOS setup doesn't offer any option.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     Can anyone comment on this topic, please?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
This problem I couldn't reproduce after I wrote my mail. After I had a<br>
working system, I tried to boot the machine without a keyboard<br>
connected,<br>
and it (almost) worked as expected:<br>
<p>
When the AlphaBIOS doesn't find a keyboard connected to the keyboard<br>
controller, it displays a short explanation on the VGA screen and<br>
redirects all further output to serial port #1 (at 9600bps, 8N1)<br>
<p>
This works fine. I connected a serial terminal to the port and I could<br>
use the terminal to control the setup-program and so on.<br>
But there seems to be one glitch: now the AlphaBIOS seems to ignore the<br>
Auto Start option: I have enabled Auto Start (10 seconds waiting time),<br>
but the AlphaBIOS just displays the OS selection menu and waits for<br>
input <br>
from the terminal.<br>
Here I can select the OS manually, and the Linux kernel even echoes<br>
all kernel messages to the serial port (I compiled with this option<br>
enabled), but I want it to boot automatically!<br>
Anyone knows if there is a new AlphaBIOS (newer than 5.60) which<br>
doesn't show this behaviour? Where can I download a newer AlphaBIOS for<br>
the PC164LX?<br>
<p>
Anyway, I want to thank all who responded to my questions, first of all<br>
Jay Estabrook, who provided the clearest solution  :-)<br>
<p>
I also want to thank Christian Czezatke who helped me setting up the<br>
machine with different MILO's and other startup-parameters over and over<br>
again, despite of his cold (Hi Christian, hope you're feeling a little <br>
bit better now, maybe the large pizzas were the right medicine?!  :-)<br>

PS: I did some benchmark tests with this system. <br>
If anyone is interested how the 600MHZ AlphaPC 164LX is performing and<br>
want<br>
to compare the figures with other systems, take a look at my web-site <br>
at &lt;<a href="http://www.xss.co.at/bench">http://www.xss.co.at/bench</a>&gt;. Here I have collected the results of<br>
the SSBA benchmark suite for several HP-UX and Linux systems (I<br>
benchmark<br>
all my systems before I deliver them to my customers. This is a very<br>
good<br>
check to see if the machine is set up correctly!)<br>
