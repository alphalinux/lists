<i>&gt; What kind of problems did you have? I had 24M of the original ECC memory,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and i bought 2x8M 36bit 70ns mem more, and that was when mem errors becan</i><br>
<i>&gt; to occur. First i had about 2 months ECC correctable cache errors, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; finally, the machine jammed. I removed those 8M chips, and the machine</i><br>
<i>&gt; booted normally. But when i gave those chips to my friend who send them to</i><br>
<i>&gt; manufacturer and they came back with message that said that there was no</i><br>
<i>&gt; errors on chips, i didnt know what to do. Those 2 SIMM slots are broke or</i><br>
<i>&gt; then there's something wrong wiht compability :) Please, let me know if</i><br>
<i>&gt; there's something i should do...</i><br>
<p>
I had purchased a pair of 4x36 SIMMS about 5 or 6 months ago.  I had<br>
nothing but problems with them.  I'd get correctable and uncorrectable<br>
memory errors all the time.  Since I didn't have a lot of time to mess<br>
with it over the summer, I just left it like it was for the time being.<br>
<p>
Recently I bought 2 new 4X36 60ns.  I replaced the error prone SIMMs and<br>
haven't had a problem since.<br>
<p>
The cool thing is that I took the error prone ones out and put them in my<br>
Pentium Pro 200Mhz machine.  I was very skeptical about this, but I<br>
haven't had a single problem with the RAM yet.  It seems amazing to me,<br>
but the AXP must just really beat on memory a lot harder than these Intel<br>
boxes.<br>
<p>
I hope this helps.  The memory probablly isn't bad, just not GREAT like<br>
you need it to be.<br>
<p>
I searched for a long time for an answer to the same question and never<br>
found an answer, so I finally just shelled out the money for new RAM.  I<br>
think that's what you'll have to do, unless you can return the old stuff<br>
still.<br>
<p>
Good luck,<br>
Ed<br>
