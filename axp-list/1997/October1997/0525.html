<p>
You can only assume that if you know none of the history of it.<br>
<p>
The 8086 was only intended to be an improved replacement for the 8085,<br>
continuing the chain from the 8080 and 8008 (but not from the 4040 and 4004,<br>
despite claims of people who've never so much as looked at the data sheets).<br>
<p>
Back in 1972, when the 8008 was being designed, there wasn't nearly as much<br>
literature on the subject.  Also, they were only trying to design an<br>
embedded controller, not a general-purpose computer.<br>
<p>
At about the same time that they were designing the 8086, they also had<br>
an advanced development project for a 32-bit processor that *was* intended<br>
for general purpose computing.  Originally known as the 8800, it was<br>
renamed the iAPX 432 prior to release.  It was what might be called a VCISC,<br>
and was not successful in the marketplace, largely owing to poor performance.<br>
<p>
Since the 432 failed, they had to push the 8086 family (80286, 80386, etc.),<br>
while they developed a new high-end architecture (which eventually became<br>
the i960).  However, in the mean time the IBM clone market grew so rapidly<br>
that x86 compatability became more important than raw performance.  Hence<br>
the i960 has only been successful in the embedded market.<br>
<p>
Many people make the mistake of thinking that Intel *likes* the x86<br>
architecture, but my own occasional discussions with Intel engineers reveal<br>
that they are as disgusted with it as anyone. <br>
<p>
Back in 1990 I went to see the film "The Hunt for Red October" on opening<br>
night with a coworker from Apple.  We got in line very early, and were<br>
conversing about Macintosh software issues.  After a while, someone nearby<br>
asked us if we worked at Apple.  He then asked, "when are you guys going to<br>
build a computer around an Intel processor?"  While I was trying to think of a<br>
tactful reply, my coworker blurted out, "We wouldn't put an Intel<br>
piece-of-junk in *our* computers!"  As I expected, the guy turned out to be an<br>
Intel employee, and in fact, the the designer of the i486 FPU.  He didn't take<br>
offense, and we had a nice chat.  He was understandably proud of his work, but<br>
was unhappy that they had so much baggage from the earlier processors that<br>
had to be carried forward.<br>
<p>
Intel didn't choose for the x86 to be their premier architecture, it just<br>
happened.  Of course, unless you are a complete idiot you don't refuse to sell<br>
the customer what he wants to buy and try to steer him to something else<br>
instead.  That approach drives the customers into the hands of the competitor,<br>
as happened in 1986 when DEC pulled the plug on the DECsystem-10 and<br>
DECSYSTEM-20 and tried to force customers to migrate to the VAX.  (Many of the<br>
customers went to Sun and other Unix based systems; this was before DEC<br>
embraced Unix.)<br>
<p>
Anyhow, the amazing thing is that Intel has been able to take such a feeble<br>
base architecture (the 8086), and due to customer demand turn it into one<br>
of the highest-performance microprocessors on the planet (the Pentium II).<br>
(Yes, I know that the Alpha is faster.  That's not the point.)<br>
<p>
I'm certainly no fan of the x86, but I've got to respect Intel's engineering<br>
accomplishments.  I'll have to admit that I'm somewhat skeptical about their<br>
new IA64 'EPIC' architecture.  However, Intel and HP may eventually succeed at<br>
something that we've only dreamed about DEC doing with Alpha: migrating the<br>
entire PC market onto a non-x86 architecture.  Yes, it is true that the initial<br>
implementations of IA64 will include x86 compatability, but after people have<br>
been running Windows NT/IA64 for a few years they will be able to start<br>
phasing out IA32.  (IA32 will probably live on forever in simulation and/or<br>
binary translation.)<br>
<p>
Even though Alpha is my favorite architecture today, realisticly I can't<br>
believe that it will ever succeed in the general PC market, whereas IA64<br>
has a good chance.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
Eric<br>
