Ok, I'm stumped.<br>
<p>
Machine: Alphastation 255/233 - pretty much vanilla<br>
 - standard Digital TGA &amp; ethernet &amp; 1 Gig HD &amp; CD Rom &amp; official $100<br>
Digital Fd.<br>
 - also a Segate 4 Gig disk on SCSI Id 1 - which is where I want to<br>
put Linux.<br>
 - Console is SRM 6.0-943.<br>
 - default OS is DEC UNIX 3.2d<br>
<p>
Linux Distribution: RedHat 4.2 for Alpha.<br>
<p>
Configuration I need to reach:<br>
 Digital UNIX on the Dec HD<br>
 Linux on the Seagate HD<br>
 either bootable. [I don't care if I need to floppy boot LINUX, as<br>
long as I can boot both and know how to build a stand alone LINUX<br>
machine at some point]<br>
<p>
I *think* this means<br>
 1. I have to boot under SRM, not MILO<br>
 2. I don't think I can upgrade SRM based on what I saw on<br>
gatekeeper. The release notes for SRM 6.4 and 6.5 appear NOT to<br>
support DEC UNIX 3.2d, although they support 3.2c and 4.0 [I don't<br>
think upgrading to 4.0 or downgrading to 3.2c is an option]  Can anyone<br>
confirm or disabuse this?<br>
 3. I need to find some way to boot an `avanti' kernel.<br>
<p>
What I think is on the RedHat CD [think, because the RedHat book<br>
doesn't track the distribution very well]:<br>
 - MILO does not support `avanti' - don't see one in ~cdrom/milo/...<br>
 - aboot for SRM may be supported someplace in there someplace, but<br>
I'm not sure where.  I had a floppy constructed which brought up aboot<br>
and tried to boot a kernel, but it couldn't figure out what to do with<br>
the kernel.<br>
<p>
Can somebody clearly map out the CD, so I can try to find out what is<br>
on there?  What is the difference between avanti... and avanti-s...?<br>
What is the difference between images/ and kernels/?  Stuff like that.<br>
<p>
Alternately, I could build everything from scratch under DEC Unix, but<br>
would like some words of advice from `someone who has gone before'.<br>
This is not acceptable in the longer term because we are aiming at a<br>
commercial product which must have clear, easy to follow, correct<br>
instructions which result in a working system with little effort and<br>
in a short time.  This finite-but-arbitrary-time stuff won't fly.<br>
<p>
Eagerly awaiting any light for this dim corner of the world.<br>
