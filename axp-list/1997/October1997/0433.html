<i>&gt; Ahem, gnu tar is pretty good at that. :-)  Did you try?  Not all tar</i><br>
<i>&gt; utilities are born the same.  BTW, this is directly from 'tar --help':</i><br>
<p>
Just to let you know I'm not disputing whether or not tar can backup over a<br>
network.  I just know that not only have I experienced incidents of not being<br>
able to get an archive off a tape, because I wrote it with tar, and it was<br>
corrupt 1/3rd the way in..<br>
<p>
Most of the programs that are out there have this problem.  I think dump (dd as<br>
well?) will verify the data that was written can be recovered, and that is why<br>
if I used amanda, I would use it with dump.<br>
<p>
Now, don't confuse 'tar -tvf /dev/tape' with being able to recover the data<br>
that's on the tape.  '-tvf' views the listing of the contents, not the actual<br>
data, and it doesn't verify.<br>
<p>
I also realize that it has a --verify option, but I suspect that's a simple<br>
check to see the file it read is the file on the disk. <br>
<p>
BRU has a CRC check that it uses, and from their web page:<br>
<p>
My tape drive has ECC, why is BRU 2000's CRC so important<br>
<p>
In creating a system backup, your backup software copies your data from your<br>
file system into a buffer in memory. From there, the data is transferred<br>
through your system and across the system backplane to the backup device<br>
controller. From the controller, the data is passed over a cable to the backup<br>
device. Once in the backup device's input buffer, the data is then processed<br>
and drive-based ECC is added. BRU 2000's CRC is added when the data is copied<br>
from the fixed disk to the memory buffer. This way, if the buffer is corrupted<br>
on its way to the backup device, BRU 2000 will realize this and inform you. The<br>
drive would have just provided error correction code for the bad data. <br>
