<i>&gt; noone collaborates because everybody thinks everybody else is wrong.  they</i><br>
<i>&gt; all think they can do better, and in some cases they do but usually not.</i><br>
<i>&gt; i prefer linux because i belive it is done right, and it works.</i><br>
<p>
Not so much "Everyone else is wrong" as it is "We've got the *right* approach, <br>
and you all don't."<br>
<p>
There are some things about the *BSD systems that are "superior" to Linux; <br>
they already have things like logging/journalled and semi-memory-resident file <br>
systems.  These are things that it would be *nice* for Linux to have; the <br>
former provides a fast file system that's more robust than ext2; the latter is <br>
very nice for temporary files.<br>
<p>
Linux of course has had a "concentration" on having *LOTS* of variant sorts of <br>
file systems, supporting various MS-DOS FAT variants as well as file systems <br>
for all sorts of "obsolete" computer systems.<br>
<p>
There are different approaches being taken; I think I prefer the "Linux <br>
approach" particularly in the view of the "Cathedral versus the Bazaar" <br>
approach (see Eric Raymond's essay at URL &lt;<a href="http://www.ccil.org/~esr/writings/ca">http://www.ccil.org/~esr/writings/ca</a><br>
thedral.html&gt;).<br>
<p>
The quick summary is that Linux has seen *rapid* development on its kernel by <br>
enormous numbers of people due to the "open"/"Bazaar" approach taken to kernel <br>
releases where there's a release every week, bugs fixed or not.  The *BSDs <br>
have generally taken the "Cathedral" approach, where a small core group of <br>
developers periodically release a "beautiful" version for the rest of the <br>
world to admire.<br>
<p>
The "openness" of this approach has encouraged wide participation, and is a <br>
strength of Linux.  Which doesn't make the other guys awful/bad.  There have <br>
been contributions back and forth:<br>
<p>
a) Linux networking code was originally based on that from *BSD.<br>
b) FreeBSD in particular has borrowed device driver code from Linux, and there <br>
have been returns to Linux.<br>
c) Many tools and applications run quite nicely on Linux and *BSD.<br>
<p>
There are some disagreements on development approaches; the *BSD groups eschew <br>
the GPL, feeling that it denies them some freedoms that the "Berkeley License" <br>
provides them.  I would suggest that *that* is the primary issue separating <br>
them.<br>
<p>
The "BSD" argument is that the GPL is a "licensing virus" that forces software <br>
to be "free" whether the authors want that to be the case or not.  They would <br>
like for a commercial enterprise to be able to take the code and be able to <br>
"privatize" derivatives.  RMS and the FSF considers that to be just a <br>
*horrible* idea; "All software ought to be free."<br>
<p>
I think that both situations can reverse themselves:<br>
<p>
- Companies will be very happy to see "Berkeley code" as it allows them to <br>
appropriate it for themselves.  Commercial enterprises are unlikely to <br>
substantially contribute "free Berkeley code" as they know that others can <br>
appropriate it without them receiving any intrinsic reward.<br>
<p>
Why would Digital contribute to a "BSD" project, when a competing company <br>
would be free to grab that code, modify it, and make the results secret?  <br>
Digital doesn't benefit.<br>
<p>
- Companies would be more willing to contribute to GPLed code as it means that <br>
if other companies do further development, what goes around comes back.<br>
<p>
If Digital contributes to GCC code optimization, and Intel takes that and does <br>
further development, those results *must* be then available to Digital.  <br>
Everyone, notably including the original contributor, benefits.<br>
<p>
In any case, there are some strong feelings surrounding the legalities, which <br>
is a significant barrier to many of those that are "BSD Believers."<br>
