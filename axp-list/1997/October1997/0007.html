Ok, here's what I know:<br>
<p>
Well, not much. =) The chipset is a 21172 (21172BA and 21172CA chips), the<br>
CPU is a 500Mhz. There are 8 SIMM slots, 4 PCI slots, 2 ISA slots if I<br>
recall. Does anybody know which precompiled milo/kernel set I should be<br>
using? I have no clue what kind of motherboard it is or anything, as my<br>
company purchased it before I came into this position. We're trashing NT<br>
and I've been working (read: fighting) with it for a week now. I've<br>
successfully booted with the MILO-2031-PC164 and PC164-2031-test.gz<br>
precompiled images that I got (I think) from gatekeeper. I ftp'd the<br>
entire alpha subdirectory from redhat.com (pub/redhat/RedHat-4.2/alpha),<br>
burned it to a CD, and finally managed to install just about every RPM<br>
onto the hard drive (scsi, as is the cd drive).<br>
<p>
However, if I try to mount sda1 as root (at the milo prompt: boot<br>
fd0:vmlinux.gz root=/dev/sda1) then it loads the kernel, and when it gets<br>
to mounting the filesystem, spontaneously reboots.<br>
<p>
I also managed to boot with the root floppy, mount the hard drive, and got<br>
a kernel compiled semi-successfully, but with some warnings. I selected<br>
PC164, since it's worked so far, but is there a better selection? Whenever<br>
I try booting *that* kernel, it fails on an invalid magic number (or some<br>
such) when trying to load the kernel. I did a make boot, gzipped the<br>
stripped kernel, and cp vmlinux.gz /dev/fd0.<br>
<p>
So, I have a few questions: 1) Is PC164 correct for that chipset? Is there<br>
a different, even experimental/beta/whatever kernel? 2) Why does it<br>
spontaneously reboot when mounting the sda1? and 3) What's with the magic<br>
number error? Is it just compiled for the wrong chipset, or what?<br>
