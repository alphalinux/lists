What kind of performance did you expect from it?  Just curious.  The UDB<br>
is pretty much the "bottom of the barrel" when it comes to Alphas since<br>
it's memory access is horribly limited and slow compared to the more<br>
upscale Alphas.  You probably would've been better off with a PC164<br>
motherboard and a 466MHz Alpha to really soar performance-wise.<br>

Ah, ok.  Guess I should've read that sentence to get an idea of what<br>
you're comparing it to.  I also have a UDB, but with a pretty stock config<br>
(24MB RAM, Jaz drive, and internal 540MB hard drive) and know your pain as<br>
far as most performance issues go, BUT I do have to say that my floating<br>
point operations are much better than my Pentium 75 at home.  I guess it<br>
all depends on what you're doing with it.  To be able to maybe give you<br>
better performance hints, I would have to know what you are doing on the<br>
UDB that makes your impression of it so poor.<br>
<p>
Keep in mind that gcc isn't totally mature on the Alpha platform right<br>
now, and therefore, doesn't necessarily generate the most optimised code<br>
at times.  This becomes evident when comparing the same code on the same<br>
machine running under Digital UNIX vs Linux.  Strides are being made to<br>
correct this, but I don't have a time schedule from "the powers that be"<br>
yet.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I am using the stock kernel that came with RedHat because I can't get anything</i><br>
<i>&gt; else to compile right for me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Does anybody know what the problem could be?   Has anybody put up one of the newer</i><br>
<i>&gt; versions of compiled kernel and modules for UDB that I can download to experiment</i><br>
<i>&gt; with?</i><br>
<p>
In all fairness, I don't run RedHat on my UDB (I'm a Debian person and am<br>
working with the group to port over our distribution to the Alpha), BUT I<br>
do know that I have several kernels compiled and running on my UDB.  In<br>
fact, I just compiled a mostly modularised 2.1.57 kernel today without a<br>
problem.  You probably could get slightly better performance out of a<br>
"hand-rolled" kernel, FYI.  Be sure to get the appropriate AXP patches for<br>
it prior to trying to compile it under RedHat, btw...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; While I am at it, asking for help, can anybody email me their XF86Config</i><br>
<i>&gt; file for UDB?</i><br>
<p>
Wish I could.  I don't run X on my machine due to memory limitations and<br>
general lack of interest.  I find that I can do just about everything with<br>
a bunch of VT's and some ingenuity :)<br>
