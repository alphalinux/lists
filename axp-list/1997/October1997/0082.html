My appologies to the list in advance for what either are or should be<br>
FAQs. FAQ or not, I'm not locating the answers, so I ask either for<br>
pointers or answers and we will get the answers into the archives again at<br>
least! Or come off list and I can attempt to summarize later, as people<br>
see fit.<br>
<p>
I purchased a Digital UDB as a learning test bed last month, not realizing<br>
that my intel Linux box was about to self-destruct. Since it looks like<br>
the Intel machine is going to take  better than another week to fix, I<br>
need to get the UDB setup to replace it. I do have the RH4.2 PowerTools on<br>
order, but I'm having to run 4.1 at the moment.<br>
<p>
1) Not strictly a RH question, sorry: When I turn off the UDB for a period<br>
of time, the onboard clock goes sour (I get a date sometime in 2017 or<br>
something). Time is kept well when the hardware is on, but I should not<br>
have to worry about turning off the power. Any leads? (A good candidate to<br>
come off list 8-))<br>
<p>
2) Portions of the RH control panel simply don't work, or don't work<br>
correctly for me. Specifically glint, the network config, and user &amp; group<br>
config portions either don't start at all, or don't work once started. Is<br>
this a known problem, or am I special? What I've needed to do, I can do<br>
from the command line, but I'd like to know that the supplied software<br>
either does work, or what the fix/workaround is.<br>
<p>
3) On the redhat-list, there was some noise about a month ago about<br>
"linuxconf", a system supposedly to handle most/all of the configur<br>
options/confusions found under linux. Before I got to the point of needing<br>
the UDB for regular use, I tried to locate and attempted to compile<br>
linuxconf for the alpha without success. Has anybody tried this out with<br>
any results?<br>
<p>
4) I did find out from the archives that there is magic involved with<br>
getting a modem to run from the pcmcia slot on the back of the UDB. I<br>
didn't quite follow the instructions found in the archives, so could<br>
somebody expand on the incantations? <br>
<p>
5) Again, I did find mention in the archives, but didn't quite follow the<br>
details. Can somebody expand on the limitations and setting up of the<br>
emulator for intel binaries?<br>
<p>
Again, my appologies for what should be FAQs to the list, but I'm just not<br>
absorbing the little bit I'm finding. I do appreciate your guidance and<br>
patience.<br>
