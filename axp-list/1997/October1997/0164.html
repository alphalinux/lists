I hope that I am not annoying everyone (since I asked similar<br>
questions before), but so far the answers haven't been really <br>
satisfying either.  In particular I'd appreciate some<br>
information from the very helpful folks at DEC; I'd at least<br>
like to understand...<br>
<p>
Some of you may be aware that in comp.os.linux.alpha<br>
there is a semi-religious war going on regarding the relative merits<br>
of SCSI vs. (E)IDE.  I don't want't to start any such discussions<br>
here, I'd just like to know / understand why a pc164 motherboard<br>
(500 MHz CPU, 2MB L3 cache, 128 MB RAM) with a <br>
 WDC AC34000L, 3815MB w/256kB Cache, LBA, CHS=7752/16/63<br>
hard-drive is so bloody slow with respect to disk performance and<br>
what I can do about it (one thing I most likely will do is to<br>
get an NCR810 controller in the near future!)<br>
<p>
Now, based on hdparm -tT, the performance isn't all that bad if I<br>
first set hdparm -u 0, contrary to the recommendations in the FAQ.<br>
Yeah, of course the clock looses 10 minutes a day in this case, but I<br>
sort of can live with that.  If on the other hand you set hdparm -u 1,<br>
the performance reported by hdparm -tT goes down dramatically.<br>
HOWEVER, somehow I don't believe the numbers are very meaningful as<br>
any operation involving lots of disk I/O feel sluggish compared to a<br>
lowly P-133MHz running the same RH 4.2, but having a SCSI disk system.<br>
I don't have hard numbers, but copying one of my trajectory files<br>
(50MB) from one partition to the other (same physical disk) literally<br>
freezes the machine.  Response is extremely bad, trying to log into<br>
the machine (telnet) during the copy takes several seconds to get you<br>
a prompt (normally instanteneous), and the copying itself strikes me<br>
as slow (as if I were ftping the file and not performing a disk to<br>
disk copy).<br>
<p>
Now, overall I like this machine -- it's number crunching capabilities<br>
are great, since the June (?) axp-patches to 2.0.30 it's actually stable<br>
(not a single hang despite lots of computations), but somehow the <br>
situation is unsatisfactory.<br>
<p>
To reiterate, I'd really like to understand all this:  What IDE chipset<br>
is on an pc164 motherboard?  (There was a post claiming that on the<br>
LX boards, the cmd640 is used, which doesn't strike me as the best<br>
possible choice...  I built a kernel with cmd640 support, but there<br>
is no sign that this particular chipset is detected during booting)<br>
hdparm refuses to let me set -d 1 (DMA support) or any of the PIO<br>
options -- is this indeed a limitation of the chipset used or is it<br>
something missing in the alpha port of the IDE-driver / hdparm ???<br>
Should I try any of the pre-2.0.30 kernels with the even newer<br>
axp-patches ???<br>
<p>
Any tips regarding IDE appreciated -- even if it's reliable knowledge<br>
that this particular hardware can't be supported any better (at least<br>
then I know).  <br>
<p>
Also, I/we (our group) hopes to get some money, and a SCSI subsystem for<br>
the Alpha is first on the list of my things to get.  QUESTION: Is an<br>
NCR 810 controller sufficient/good, or should I find the extra money<br>
for an Adaptec 2940UW or an IntraServer card.  But somehow I don't see<br>
the advantage of wide SCSI for a system that will at max. have two<br>
disks hanging from the controller -- I am only worried about the cabling<br>
issues.<br>
<p>
Thanks in advance,<br>
<p>
Stefan<br>
