Behold: on that day, 29 of September in the year 1997,<br>
Michael W. Chalkley spake unto me, saying:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Hello:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I just purchased a used 275 Mhz Alpha with a Cabriolet Motherboard. It only </i><br>
<i>&gt; has 32 Meg of Ram (4 of 8 slots populated). I have a couple of questions:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1. I know it is not the fastest system available but could I use it</i><br>
<i>&gt; as both a news and web server?</i><br>
<p>
I would guess easily.  This is not exactly a _slow_ box we're talking<br>
about here.  Depending on your demands, I would guess that drive<br>
access and net bandwidth would be limiting factors _way_ before the<br>
CPU would.  And memory, of course (but that's true for any box).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2. Should I add another 4 simms to take it to 64 Meg or should I</i><br>
<i>&gt; swap it all out and take it to 128? Can I add 64 to the current 32?</i><br>
<p>
I own such a box and have it running fine on the 32+64=96Mb config.<br>
<p>
Also, cache is important.  Mine is configured at 2Mb 8ns cache -- I<br>
would upgrade that too if you have less than 1Mb.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3. What type of memory do I need. What are the average prices?</i><br>
<p>
FULL PARITY!  You can get it from many memory dealers, but they often<br>
don't believe you when you say FULL PARITY.  NOT logical parity.<br>
Emphasize this to them.  NOT LOGICAL PARITY.  IT WILL NOT WORK!  AT<br>
ALL!  Not even just a little bit.  Don't let them even suggest<br>
shipping anything except full parity.  And nothing marginal either --<br>
this machine hits its memory hard (much harder than your typical<br>
WinTel box, so the dealer might not be used to having to live up to<br>
real standards) and flakey memory will give you endless headaches.  As<br>
you can guess, I had to send back some memory -- 3 separate lots, to<br>
be specific -- for these kinds of reasons...  Works great with good<br>
memory, though.<br>
<p>
Also, this box predates the recent memory revolutions.  Doesn't<br>
support EDO or anything more modern.<br>
<p>
And I have no clue about prices -- haven't been in the market for<br>
memory for too long.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 4. What is the most stable version of RedHat I should run?</i><br>
<p>
I've been running 2.0.28 just fine for quite a while now.  I hear that<br>
2.0.30 works well too, but when I tried it I had some problems with<br>
the IPX protocol drivers.  YMMV.<br>
<p>
Your other questions are beyond my experience.  Sorry.<br>
<p>
Good luck, and enjoy!<br>
<p>

  "But I don't want to go among mad people," Alice remarked.
  "Oh, you can't help that," said the Cat: "we're all mad here. I'm mad.
      You're mad."
  "How do you know I'm mad?" said Alice.
  "You must be," said the Cat, "or you wouldn't have come here."
