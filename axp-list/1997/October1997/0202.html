  Since I had so little success in getting either the Mach64 or<br>
Diamond Stealth to work in the udb, I decided to try a Matrox<br>
Millineum 1, which I have been told by many people is 'the thing to<br>
get' for udb's.<br>
<p>
 I have had much better success (i.e., it doesn't hang ARC, and I can<br>
actually boot the system).  However, there are still some problems, I<br>
cannot get MILO to properly initialize the card.  Before builing a new<br>
MILO, it would just hang at the "swapping to PAL code" screen.  I<br>
applied to patches the 2.0.30 MILO as suggested eaelier on this list by<br>
Steven Hirsch, and it no longer hung there.  With Digital Bios<br>
compiled in, the screen looked like it was trying to sync, and then<br>
hung; the machine never booted.  Without Digital Bios, you see nothing<br>
in MILO, and when the kernel boots (already with TGA compiled out),<br>
the screen just turns red.  But, the machine does come up.  Has anyone<br>
had any success in getting MILO to correctly initialize the bios?  Should<br>
I be using a different version of MILO?  It seems that if the Digital<br>
Bios can initalize the card for the ARC, then it should be able to do<br>
the same again.  Any help appreciated.<br>
<p>
Here is what the serial port is displaying with bios compiled in:<br>

 Next, I figured that if the console didn't work right away, I would
just use X.  However the only thing that happens when I try using X
(at many a diffrent resolution) is the error "MGA: Drawing Engine
time-out."  It also seems to attempt (and sometimes succeed) in
corrupting memory.  It spit out tons of memory errors in this state,
and when accidently left running for an hour, corrupted all the *tys.
It did, however, look like it was almost working.  It displayed a
screen, and the default fvwm95 colored it that green color, but I
never saw a cursor.  Has anyone had any success with this card?  I am
using the updated version of XFree from redhat, XFree86-3.3.1-1.  It
would be a great help if I could get this working; I could log in with
xdm even if the console wasn't working for now.
<p>
 Thanks again,
