<p>
SANTA CLARA, Calif. and MAYNARD, Mass., Oct. 27 /PRNewswire/ -- Digital<br>
Equipment Corporation (NYSE:DEC) and Intel Corporation (Nasdaq:INTC)<br>
today announced that they have agreed to establish a broad-based<br>
business relationship that will provide significant short- and long-term<br>
benefits to both companies<br>
and their customers. <br>
<p>
The multi-year agreement includes sale of Digital's semiconductor<br>
manufacturing operations to Intel for approximately $700 million, cross-<br>
licensing of patents,<br>
supply of both Intel and Alpha microprocessors and development of future<br>
systems based on Intel's 64-bit microprocessors. No other financial<br>
details were<br>
disclosed. <br>
<p>
Digital and Intel agreed to request a stay of all lawsuits until U.S.<br>
government approval is granted which is required to finalize the<br>
agreement. <br>
<p>
``This agreement meets both companies' needs,'' said Craig Barrett,<br>
president and chief operating officer of Intel. ``We are pleased to get<br>
alignment with one of the<br>
world's major computer companies on IA-64 microprocessors and to let the<br>
marketplace judge our work.'' <br>
<p>
``This agreement brings issues between the two companies to a resolution<br>
that benefits customers in many important ways,'' said Digital Chairman<br>
Robert B. Palmer.<br>
``It ensures long-term availability of Digital's Alpha-based offerings<br>
for OpenVMS, Digital UNIX and Windows NT customers. In addition, Digital<br>
will develop<br>
Digital UNIX and Windows NT offerings on the IA-64 architecture. <br>
<p>
Key components of the agreement pending government approval: <br>
<p>
    -- Digital and Intel will enter into a 10 year patent cross license<br>
      agreement.<br>
<p>
    -- Intel will purchase Digital's semiconductor operations including<br>
state-<br>
       of-the-art facilities in Hudson, Massachusetts as well as<br>
development<br>
       operations in Jerusalem, Israel and Austin, Texas for<br>
approximately<br>
       $700 million.<br>
<p>
    -- Digital will retain its Alpha and Alpha-related semiconductor<br>
design<br>
       teams to continue to develop future generations of Alpha.  Intel<br>
will<br>
       make offers of employment to other Digital semiconductor<br>
employees.<br>
<p>
    -- Intel will serve as a foundry for Digital for multiple<br>
generations of<br>
       Alpha microprocessors.<br>
<p>
    -- Intel will provide Intel products and comprehensive technical<br>
support<br>
       to Digital consistent with practices for other major Intel OEMs.<br>
    -- Digital will develop a full line of systems based on Intel's<br>
IA-64<br>
       processor family.<br>
<p>
    -- Digital will port, with technical assistance from Intel, its<br>
industry-<br>
       leading Digital UNIX to Intel's IA-64.<br>
<p>
    -- Intel will obtain rights to manufacture and sell other non-Alpha<br>
       Digital semiconductor products.<br>
<p>
<p>
``Digital's mission is to deliver with our partners Internet business<br>
solutions based on high-performance platforms and services,'' Palmer<br>
said. ``This agreement<br>
strengthens our ability to offer products that help make our customers<br>
more competitive and confirms our dual Alpha and Intel platform<br>
strategy.'' <br>
