Ken Griffith,<br>
<p>
Thank you for your response.<br>
<p>
It sounds like you are unable to accept criticism of any sort.<br>
<p>
Why is my response "whiney"?<br>
<p>
Like I said in my messages to your individuals in your group, "I have no<br>
idea who you are."  I am sure you serve a legitimate purpose to those of<br>
you with similar interests.  I belong to only one listserver (Not Yours)<br>
and know the value of these things.<br>
<p>
However when you enter my domain uninvited (I never joined yours) with 25<br>
messages all of a sudden, and when I awake this morning with 60, it seems<br>
that my annoyance is justified.  These are not "infantile musings".  It is<br>
you and your group who is "trashing my inbox", not the other way around.<br>
<p>
Besides, I sent my "whiney drivel" back to the individuals, not to your<br>
total list.  However this message is being sent to all your colleagues so<br>
that they can get a taste of what kind of person you really are.<br>
<p>
I did not subscribe to your group.  Please advise me when I first showed up<br>
on your list of subscribers.<br>
<p>
Because your interests are not mine, why should I bother to read any of the<br>
messages?  I did not invite you in.<br>
 <br>
Furthermore your threat of retribution of 1000 responses is irresponsible. <br>
Now that you have made your threat public, if you carry it out, you could<br>
legitimately be hauled up for conspiracy.  <br>
<p>
You suggest that I change my e-mail address.  Why should I do that?  What<br>
have I done wrong to deserve this?  What could I have done differently? <br>
<p>
Keith, if you are the listmaster, surely you have the power to delete names<br>
from your own list.  If so, please remove mine.  Then please let me know<br>
privately that you have done so.  That would be the mature thing to do.<br>
<p>
Your group seems designed to help one another in the computer area (I don't<br>
understand your jargon).  The list I belong to does the same thing, except<br>
in 18 months we have yet to flame anyone.  Lets trust that you can achieve<br>
the same level of netiquet.<br>
<p>
I have no desire to get into a slinging match with anyone.  You stay in<br>
your domaine and I'll happily stay in mine.<br>
<p>
Chris Young  (man, not boy)<br>

Do NOT clutter my newsgroup with your whiney drivel.  If you would bother<br>
to READ any of the mail you asked for ( you can't be "accidentally" added<br>
to a list - either you did it or someone don't like you ) it would tell you<br>
how to unsubscribe without trashing everyone's inbox with your infantile<br>
musings.  You might as well get your email address changed,  because I will<br>
send you 1000 emails from different locations for every whiny post on my<br>
newsgroup.  You will have to sort through thousands of emails to find<br>
anything even remotely relevant.  Sound like fun?<br>
<p>
