Hi,<br>
<p>
Normally I would not respond to such drivel, but since the Wall Street Journal<br>
has chosen to say something about it, here goes.<br>
<p>
Yes, Digital is in a suit against Intel.<br>
<p>
Things are discussed in settlement actions.  They should not EVER be discussed<br>
outside those settlement discussions.  No reputable negotiator would ever<br>
do that.<br>
<p>
In the past there have been rumors and rumors of rumors about various companies<br>
buying Digital, about Digital doing this, Digital doing that, and all have<br>
been for naught.  Even when formal agreements are made, papers signed, etc.<br>
things don't always work out (can you say "ACE"?)<br>
<p>
So, as the statement below says, don't think its happening until the Fat Lady<br>
Sings.....<br>
<p>
You can sign me:<br>
<p>
TIRED OF BEING ASKED ABOUT IT IN NASHUA<br>
<p>
<p>
                 *****THIS MESSAGE IS FROM TOM SIEKMAN*****<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 There are stories in today's press regarding the potential settlement <br>
 of the patent infringement suit we filed against Intel in May 1997.  <br>
 This speculation is disruptive  to both our employees and our customers.  <br>
 <br>
 There are no agreements between the two companies that resolve these <br>
 issues. <br>
  <br>
 Let me be very clear, that if any agreement  were reached on behalf of <br>
 Digital Equipment Corporation in this matter:<br>
 <br>
 o It would provide a fair resolution of our patent infringement suit.<br>
 o It would reaffirm DIGITAL Alpha as the 64-bit architecture of choice.<br>
 o It would recognize the continuing contribution of DIGITAL's people.<br>
 o It would recognize the success and growing importance of Digital's x86 <br>
   businesses for mobile, client and server computing.<br>
  <br>
 The stories you read today will likely continue until either the <br>
 conclusion of the  litigation or any settlement.  Please be assured that, <br>
 when there are facts to  report, they will be communicated promptly and <br>
 directly to you.<br>
 <br>
 In the meantime, it is crucial that employees not speculate or comment <br>
 about any  aspect of the Intel litigation, including the potential for <br>
 settlement. Any external  inquiries should be referred to Dan Kaferle at <br>
 DTN 223-2195.<br>
