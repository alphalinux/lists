<i>&gt; Yes, Digital is in a suit against Intel.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Things are discussed in settlement actions.  They should not EVER be discussed</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In the past there have been rumors and rumors of rumors about various companies</i><br>
<i>&gt; buying Digital, about Digital doing this, Digital doing that, and all have</i><br>
<i>&gt; been for naught.  Even when formal agreements are made, papers signed, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; things don't always work out (can you say "ACE"?)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So, as the statement below says, don't think its happening until the Fat Lady</i><br>

I have the utmost respect for you Jon and your position at Digital. <br>
However, Bob Palmer has made his numbers quarter after quarter by either<br>
firing people or selling yet another part of the company.  It is not out<br>
of the scope of what Digital has done to put its own technology on the<br>
table for sale.  The last people to acknowledge it would be those in the<br>
know.  Case in point, CohesionWorx.  I was in a government program that<br>
had signed up to use (I might add on my recommendation) the CohesionWorx<br>
IDE for their CM.  We were up one level under Palmer with the deal.  The<br>
ink had not dried on the deal when we read in a computer rag (actually<br>
the customer gave it to us) that the product had been sold to a third<br>
party.  We were all red faced that it took us another week through<br>
"official" channels to find out that the story was correct.  I know you<br>
truly believe what you are saying, but I am just as sure that Bob will<br>
do anything to make the numbers.  I also know that more the Journal has<br>
reported this "rumor" and it seems to have some factual basis that you,<br>
nor I, am probably aware.<br>
