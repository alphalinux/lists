Now that I'm Cabriolet-less, and having to use my old 486/33 (without<br>
X, which I can't install mainly because I can't get the most recent<br>
versions of either S.u.S.E. Linux or Craftwork Linux to install...though<br>
it seems like the former is due to a bug, the latter perhaps due to<br>
my having a fairly offbeat monochrome video card, since it gets only<br>
so far while booting and says "unable to initialize console" or some<br>
such thing), I'm really hoping to get the UDB up to snuff shortly.<br>
<p>
I've done some research, and am pretty sure about the following:<br>
<p>
  1.  Upgrade the UDB on-board RAM to 64M or maybe 128M.  (Dunno<br>
      what's on there now -- someone else indicated they'd added<br>
      64M to yield 88M, so maybe that means my UDB has 24M right now.)<br>
<p>
  2.  Get a usable keyboard for the UDB.  (Ideally, a Northgate<br>
      OmniKey/101, like I have used for years on my 486, and for<br>
      which I bought an adaptor to use on the Cabriolet while I<br>
      had it...and, yes, bought an adaptor so the keyboard that<br>
      came with Cab, which I tried to never use, was usable on the<br>
      486 for that period.)<br>
<p>
  3.  Get a suitable external box from "PC Power &amp; Cooling", which<br>
      apparently would result in a quieter external box than most.<br>
      (I'm intending to put the UDB not far from my wife's office,<br>
      so I don't want to add unnecessary noise to the system.)<br>
<p>
  4.  Put one 2.0GB 3" half-height SCSI drive in box (I already have<br>
      one such drive; I might try to acquire another for it someday.)<br>
<p>
  5.  Put a Plextor 12Plex CD-ROM in box.<br>
<p>
  6.  Put a Yamaha CDR-400 CD-R in box.<br>
<p>
This would become the Alpha I use for background testing and<br>
benchmarking of GNU Fortran (g77), plus things like doing backups<br>
(to CD-R -- I've never gotten the Sony optical drive I bought<br>
for my 486 to work consistently under Linux, and CD-R is now<br>
basically affordable enough as backup, plus the other benefits<br>
it'll have down the road) and "official" system installs from<br>
CD-ROM.<br>
<p>
(Whereas, I still have high hopes of getting a higher-end Alpha,<br>
thanks to David's and others' help, to use as my primary g77<br>
development machine, which would have experimental/development<br>
versions of software like gcc, gdb, and so on installed.)<br>
<p>
I'm hoping somebody has comments or offers of help on any of<br>
the above items.  I'm not much of a hardware person, and I just<br>
spent what felt like a very painful 8 hours or so on the 'net<br>
browsing for info on the CD-R, CD-ROM (which actually didn't<br>
take that long), the Northgate OmniKey/101 (which took *very*<br>
long -- no FAQs for buying keyboards around that I could see!?),<br>
the enclosure (also not bad, thanks to Eric Smith's enthusiastic<br>
Web page, as recommended by people on this list), and so on.<br>
<p>
For example, if anybody knows where I could buy one, or maybe<br>
even two or three, OmniKey/101's (the kind with the DIP switches,<br>
and of course the key caps intact and removable, the better to<br>
properly place Ctrl :) in new or good condition, that would be<br>
*very* helpful.  I'm hardly in any mood to buy Microsoft keyboards,<br>
for reasons that would be even more obvious if you could watch me<br>
type once I get going in Emacs (some people claim I reach 100wpm,<br>
but probably not more than 80 in real life, but stuff like Ctrl-A,<br>
Ctrl-E, and so on are very much part of my touch-typing repetoire,<br>
and there's no way I'm going to let MS train that outta me!).<br>
<p>
And, any vendors here willing to offer prices or info on the<br>
RAM upgrade, please contact me as well, since I know I don't<br>
want to figure that out myself.  (I can probably do the install<br>
myself, but that's a big challenge as someone who is mechanically<br>
declined.)<br>
<p>
In any case, I doubt the replies will be of much general interest,<br>
so replying just to me, not to the list, is probably appropriate!<br>
<p>
Again, thanks in advance!  I've already gotten so much great info<br>
from this list, I can't help but "go to the well" again.<br>
<p>
        tq vm, (burley)<br>
<p>
P.S. I blew a chance to investigate a very "interesting" bug<br>
afflicting g77 on Digital UNIX that I might have been able to<br>
reproduce under Linux on the Cabriolet, before I returned it,<br>
had I been sufficiently alert.  So, I'm looking forward to<br>
outfitting the UDB sufficiently to at least make more progress<br>
on g77, which, otherwise, seems to be doing quite well in<br>
alpha testing.  But I'm not planning on doing much, if any,<br>
work on g77 while I get these systems/network issues worked out.<br>
