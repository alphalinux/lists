We've got a couple of IEEE floating point intensive applications that<br>
we're trying to run under Alpha Linux. One of the applications is a Dec<br>
Unix application which we don't have source to and the other is an<br>
in-house tools which is native under Linux. Both expect the IEEE<br>
behavior for floating point.<br>
<p>
There was some useful information on this topic posted to the list by<br>
Jim Paradis in April. I've looked through that and the kernel sources<br>
for traps.c, osf_sys.c, fp-emul.c, and ieee-math.c in 2.1.35. There<br>
seems to be several problems I'm encountering. I've made a little<br>
headway, but I've hit a serious stumbling block.<br>
<p>
The first thing I tried was to compile a program under Dec Unix that<br>
checked the state of the fp control register. Those start out being<br>
different. It looks like Dec Unix is clearing the bits back 0 and Linux<br>
isn't. I forced those bits to 0 and I made sure<br>
current-&gt;tss.flags&amp;IEEE_TRAP_ENABLE_MASK=0 in<br>
osf_set_program_attributes.<br>
<p>
My native Dec Unix application did better, but still produced an FPE on<br>
some data files. I remembered Jim's comments about division by zero, and<br>
took a look at ieee-math.c. It looks like division by 0 returns NaN for<br>
0/0, but causes and FPE for any other numerator. As a first stab I<br>
corrected that by returning setting *c=IEEE_PINF and returning 0 in the<br>
two division routines.<br>
<p>
This doesn't appear to be the right answer, because I'm always returning<br>
IEEE_PINF. I'm not sure of the exact IEEE spec. It seems like I should<br>
have to check the sign bits of the two operands and return IEEE_NINF if<br>
they are different. (Is that true for division by negative 0?) From<br>
looking at the rest of the code I don't think IEEE_NINF is ever<br>
returned.<br>
<p>
These changes completely solved my floating point exceptions. Now I'm<br>
seeing some arithmetic acceptions. So far, my testing has shown this<br>
as occuring in fp-emul.c in alpha_fp_emul_imprecise in the case where a<br>
OPC_PAL or OPC_JSR is encountered. I'm kind of baffled by this, because<br>
I don't know enough about the Alpha instructions and scheduling. What's<br>
this routine trying to do and what does the arithmetic exception really<br>
mean? <br>
<p>
If anyone has an suggestions for how to tackle this I'd be happy to hear<br>
them. I'm hoping to bundle these changes up into a patch once I get all<br>
the problems striaghtened out.<br>
<p>
