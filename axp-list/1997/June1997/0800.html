I still would like to understand and fix lockup problems for Nikita <br>
and probably others using S3 cards in AS255 machines.<br>
<p>
I'd like to know<br>
<p>
- did you try the XFree86 3.3 server ? (if not, why???)<br>
- does it still lockup without Option "no_pci_disconnect" ?<br>
- any problems left when adding Option "no_pci_disconnect" ?<br>
  - did you only try 8bpp so far ?  (this works fine for Nikita,<br>
    so please test 16/32bpp too!<br>
<p>
- does anyone (with or without S3 card) has such a "Fore ATM" card ?<br>
  any known problems with this card ?<br>
<p>
any idea what might be the reason or what to try next ?<br>
please note that Nikita already rewrote BUSmemcpy.c (see below)<br>
to use sparse access, but this didn't help either...<br>
<p>
<p>
thanks for any idea, hint, pointer, ...<br>
<p>
<p>
-----Forwarded message from Nikita Schmidt &lt;cetus@snowball.ucd.ie&gt;-----<br>
<p>
<p>
Harald,<br>
<p>
I wish to say that I've finally found a configuration that does not<br>
cause S3 server to lock up the system.  The configuration is simple:<br>
-bpp 8.  :-(<br>
Last time I tried 8 bpp when I was fighting startup lockups in 3.2.  It<br>
did not help, so I never tried it anymore until yesterday.<br>
<p>
Now I can say that it *may* be a real hardware problem.  First, the<br>
argument that "Digital UNIX doesn't lock up" no longer works: Digital<br>
UNIX operates only in 8 bpp mode.  Second, my investigations have shown<br>
that the problem arises when (and only when) I have Fore ATM card<br>
installed.  (It actually doesn't matter what slot S3 is in.)  But in<br>
order to claim it as a hardware problem I have to install WinNT (grr...<br>
both harddrives are using disklabel at the moment...) and see if it hangs<br>
in 16 bpp mode.<br>
<p>
Although it's rather strange problem - what on earth difference from the<br>
PCI bus point of view can there be between 8 and 16 bpp?  Twice as fast<br>
video scan?  Unlikely - it works in 1280x1024x8, but hangs in<br>
800x600x16...  Maybe I should try various strange options like<br>
slow_dram_refresh, but there is a whole lot of them.  Maybe the<br>
difference in the way S3 accesses video memory in 8 and 16 bpp matters?<br>
<p>
Anyway, thanks very-very much for solving the problem in general.  3.3<br>
server with Option "no_pci_disconnect" is as stable as patched 3.2 - and<br>
still locks up instantly without this option.  Even on my supposedly buggy<br>
hardware both work pretty well in 8 bpp, and both may suddenly hang the<br>
system in 16 bpp mode.  And I tend to consider my lockups completely<br>
unrelated to that common AS255/S3 problem.<br>
<p>
Just in case that you may have some ideas about this weirdness, here's<br>
the list of things I've tried in hope to make it work (with no luck):<br>
<p>
	Option	"number_nine"	- yes, my card is #9, but this option<br>
				  makes no visible difference;<br>
	Chipset	"s3_generic";<br>
	Option	"nolinear";<br>
	MemBase	&lt;various values, including those from /proc/pci&gt;;<br>
	rewriting BUSmemcpy.c and lnx-video.c to use sparse space<br>
		instead of dense space and eliminate other-than-longword<br>
		accesses and bursts on the PCI.<br>
<p>
Forcing Option "nomemaccess" (using proper hack in the code) helps to<br>
get rid of lockups, but as far as I understand Trios can't read in this<br>
mode, so the screen eventually gets messy.  Well, that's no surprise, as<br>
we know that the reason for these lockups is certainly the framebuffer<br>
access (either through the LFB space or VGA window).<br>
<p>
Lastly, some comments on your message.<br>
<p>

I'm afraid I should send you my ATM card for this...  :-)<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Maybe if PCI burst cycles are disabled in S3, but still happen on the bus<br>
(originating from the CPU support chipset), either S3 or APECS just goes<br>
berserk?  That could be an explanation, as Alphas (at least those with<br>
APECS chipset) almost always generate burst cycles on the PCI when<br>
accessing it through the dense space.  In this case it's not the<br>
disconnect feature which is at fault.  After all, there were no<br>
unaligned accesses, nor accesses near the end of the supported address<br>
space, when those lockups were happening.<br>
<p>
Hold on...  What does Digital UNIX think about it?  Umm, you meant<br>
CR66_7, not CR67_7, didn't you?  At least your patch says it 66...<br>
All right, here we go:<br>
<p>
CR3A is 0x15 - whoa, burst cycles are enabled, as expected;<br>
CR66 is 0x89, CR67 is 0x08 - if the register in question is CR66, then<br>
	DU has PCI disconnect enabled as well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I never understood why disabling read burst cycles needs the PCI disconnec feature</i><br>
<i>&gt; and vice versa; maybe another S3 documentation bug ?!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I don't see any other reasonable explanation either.  Probably they<br>
could save a couple of transistors on this.<br>
<p>
All right, sorry for taking your time, and thanks again for your help.<br>
256 colours is better than nothing, although way worse than even 65536.<br>
<p>
Best wishes<br>
<p>
	Nikita<br>
