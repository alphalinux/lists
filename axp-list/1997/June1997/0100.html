<i> &gt; Concentric, and I, are the VICTIMS of unsolicited garbage e-mail, from</i><br>
<i> &gt; your maillist.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; For more than a week now, I have constantly requested that this cease, and</i><br>
<i> &gt; your maillist manager refuses.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Until you stop sending this unwanted garbage, it will continue to be</i><br>
<i> &gt; returned to senders.</i><br>
<p>
First of all, the members of this mailing list, for the most part, are not responsible for its maintenance, so all your babble is wasted.  Second of all, you seem to think that it is the fault of the 'maillist' that you are recieving these messages.  FYI, the maillist is a computer, and would not be sending you the messages without reason.  If you did not subscribe to this list, then somebody else subscribed your mail address to it, and it would be a simple matter to remove yourself.  However, since it appears that all attempts in this direction, if you know what you are doing, have failed.  This would imply that another mail address is being forwarded to your current one, and that address has been subscribed to this list.  I suggest contacting your isp to see if any mail is being forwarded to your account from another address, and then informing redhat that you no longer wish to be on the list.  This is not the problem of those other people subscribed to this list, and is you!<br>
!<br>
r<br>
 responsibility, regardless of how you got subscribed.  Your constant return-to-sender is very close to being regarded as a denial of service to the other users of this list.  Should this continue, I will not hesitate to inform the proper authorities.<br>
