Hi everybody,<br>
<p>
So far, pledges for $1033, a 1GB drive, and other hardware valued at<br>
~$200 have come in, but I'd say we should be able to get at least<br>
$1300 to reach the goal of the $1500 minimum---keep in mind that Craig<br>
will pitch in about as much money to get a real system, so it's not<br>
like he'll get rich or anything...<br>
<p>
Yesterday, my mailbox remained very quiet, so I'd like to ask you<br>
again to consider contributing to this good cause.  Remember, every<br>
donation counts!<br>
<p>
Also, I realize a lot of people care more for an optimized gcc than<br>
g77.  But keep in mind that two things have to come together: before<br>
being able to help somebody with donations of any kind, there needs to<br>
be somebody that is willing to do the work.  For g77 this has<br>
happened: Craig is interested in making g77 work well on Linux/Alpha<br>
and with very little effort on our side, we can make sure that he'll<br>
be able to continue to work towards that goal.  Besides, since g77<br>
uses the same backend as gcc, it's quite likely that some of his work<br>
will positively affect the gcc backend as well (and that's where all<br>
the Alpha-specific optimizations happen).  Also, keep in mind that<br>
we're not paying him in for what he's doing ($1500 for a software<br>
craftsperson of his caliber would probably buy us, oh, let's say,<br>
about 10 hours of programming time, i.e., not exactly a lot...).<br>
Instead helping him get a nice machine is simply a show of<br>
appreciation for what he's done so far.<br>
<p>
Well, this mail is getting longer than I wanted it to make, but please<br>
consider making a donation.<br>
<p>
Oh, not everybody seemed to like the idea of putting together a web<br>
page with info on the donation.  If that's a concern, it's certainly<br>
fine by me to not do that (makes for less work on my side... ;-)<br>
