As am I, although I don't see its relevance.  I hardly see wanting to avoid<br>
 automatic repostings a violation of free speech...There is a certain price you<br>
 pay for freedom of speech, I will admit that, but this shouldn't be it.  It's<br>
 not as if he has any opinions that we're censoring or something.<br>
 <br>
<i> &gt; Assuming this is about our friendly unsolicited commercial e-mail.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; On Wed, 4 Jun 1997, it was written:</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; Allowing only that which you agree with is NOT freedom of speech.</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; It's censorship.  Freedom implies that occasionally someone will say</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; something you don't like.  Letting them continue is Free Speech.</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; Making them stop is Censorship.  Take your pick.  There's no</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; grey area on this one.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Grey area, standing in a theatre and yelling fire.  The records and courts</i><br>
<i> &gt; have spoken on this.</i><br>
<p>
Also, your right to free speech does not give you the right to deny others their<br>
 right of free speech, which is exactly what mass mailing the list does, in a<br>
 limited sense, so far.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; &gt; Remember that old saying:  I may not agree with what you say, but</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt;                                         I will defend to the death, YOUR</i><br>
 RIGHT<br>
<i> &gt; &gt;                                         TO SAY IT.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; AH HAH!! But the person did not say "I may not like what you say, but I</i><br>
<i> &gt; will PAY for you to say it!!  Bear the TOTAL cost of your own speech and</i><br>
<i> &gt; actions, and don't force me to pay, and personally I don't give a f*ck</i><br>
<i> &gt; what you say.</i><br>
<p>
Another good point.  The cost you are causing others here is extremely high.  As<br>
 long as the content on this list was on topic and relatively low bandwidth and<br>
 good signal/noise ratio, the members of the list accepted that cost as the<br>
 logistical price of free information.  However, now you've introduced a cost<br>
 which we should not be forced to accept.  Now, one could say I could always<br>
 unsubscribe from the list to avoid the crap you're sending, but if that were<br>
 the case, is that not a denial-of-service by you?  Denying me the ability to<br>
 read important messages because the high-bandwidth nature of the list would be<br>
 putting an inordinate amount of load on my server, which also provides services<br>
 to other people.  So then, are you denying them service as well, if I keep the<br>
 list? And, given that the major users of this server are United Nations, U.S.<br>
 government, and educational institutions, are you constituting a national<br>
 security issue?  All this from one little misunderstanding...  Anyhow,<br>
 something to think about before you go ranting on about free speech.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; &gt; Or, did you forget about that one?</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; No we didn't forget, perhaps you did,  <a href="http://www.cauce.org">http://www.cauce.org</a></i><br>

Hrmm...maybe it's just me, but netscape just didn't want to go to this URL.<br>
