All right!  Roughly twenty-four hours into the campaign, we can boast<br>
pledges over $888 that were made by 10 individuals and two companies.<br>
In addition, Craig will be able to buy the machine from a third-party<br>
Alpha vendor "at cost" and there has been a hardware contribution<br>
which I'm guessing will be worth at least $200 (quite likely more than<br>
that, but I'll play it conservative until that hardware is sold and<br>
turned into cash).<br>
<p>
So, right now, I'd say we are at about $1088 out of the targeted<br>
minimum of $1500 (72%, somebody draw a ``thermometer'' for me, please?<br>
;-) This is great!  But keep in mind: we're not there yet---so keep<br>
those pledges coming!  (Do I sound like a tv preacher or what?)<br>
<p>
Thanks to everybody who has offered a donation so far!<br>
<p>

PS: I appended the original mail for your convenience, in case you missed<br>
    it...<br>
<p>
PPS: If we can make this fly, I volunteer to put together a little page<br>
     on the Linux/Alpha web home where we acknowledge all the donors.<br>
     Maybe we could also include a picture of Craig with his new machine<br>
     one he gets it...<br>
<p>
-----------<br>
         OK, you all probably have seen Craig Burley's recent mail announcing<br>
         that he has to return his loaned Cabriolet and trade it for a UDB.<br>
         The UDB may be a fine machine for certain jobs, but for heavy-duty<br>
         work such as g77 development, it surely isn't the right stuff.<br>
<p>
         Thus, I'd like to start a little fund raiser with the goal of putting<br>
         a nice Alpha in Craig's office.  This would help ensure that g77 on<br>
         Alpha will not just work, but that there is a chance that nice Alpha<br>
         optimizations will show up some day.  Besides, I really do think Craig<br>
         deserves a nice machine that's fun to work with, given all the hard<br>
         and good work he put in g77.<br>
<p>
         To start things, I promise to send a check over $100 to Craig for the<br>
         purpose of purchasing an Alpha machine that will ensure the continued<br>
         support and development of g77 on Linux/Alpha.  The only condition is<br>
         that we (the Linux/Alpha community) must be able raise a total of at<br>
         least $1500 for me to send in that check.  If the echo is so big that<br>
         more than $3k are raised, I would propose to divide up the per-head<br>
         share so that Craig ends up with a total of $3k (which should be<br>
         enough to buy one of the forthcoming 21164pc machines).<br>
<p>
         Note: I discussed this with Craig a bit and he says that he is not<br>
         desperate for machines, but he would definitely _love_ to have a<br>
         decent Alpha that he can use as his primary machine.  To show he's<br>
         serious about this, he offered to pay half the money for a new<br>
         machine.  Thus, even if we raise only $1500, he should still be able<br>
         to get a nice machine.<br>
<p>
         So, if you, too, think that Craig deserves a decent machine, please<br>
         send me mail and tell me how much you're willing to contribute to that<br>
         end.<br>
<p>
         Can we make this happen?<br>
