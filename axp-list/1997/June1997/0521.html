OK, you all probably have seen Craig Burley's recent mail announcing<br>
that he has to return his loaned Cabriolet and trade it for a UDB.<br>
The UDB may be a fine machine for certain jobs, but for heavy-duty<br>
work such as g77 development, it surely isn't the right stuff.<br>
<p>
Thus, I'd like to start a little fund raiser with the goal of putting<br>
a nice Alpha in Craig's office.  This would help ensure that g77 on<br>
Alpha will not just work, but that there is a chance that nice Alpha<br>
optimizations will show up some day.  Besides, I really do think Craig<br>
deserves a nice machine that's fun to work with, given all the hard<br>
and good work he put in g77.<br>
<p>
To start things, I promise to send a check over $100 to Craig for the<br>
purpose of purchasing an Alpha machine that will ensure the continued<br>
support and development of g77 on Linux/Alpha.  The only condition is<br>
that we (the Linux/Alpha community) must be able raise a total of at<br>
least $1500 for me to send in that check.  If the echo is so big that<br>
more than $3k are raised, I would propose to divide up the per-head<br>
share so that Craig ends up with a total of $3k (which should be<br>
enough to buy one of the forthcoming 21164pc machines).<br>
<p>
Note: I discussed this with Craig a bit and he says that he is not<br>
desperate for machines, but he would definitely _love_ to have a<br>
decent Alpha that he can use as his primary machine.  To show he's<br>
serious about this, he offered to pay half the money for a new<br>
machine.  Thus, even if we raise only $1500, he should still be able<br>
to get a nice machine.<br>
<p>
So, if you, too, think that Craig deserves a decent machine, please<br>
send me mail and tell me how much you're willing to contribute to that<br>
end.<br>
<p>
Can we make this happen?<br>
