I have been trying to boot netbsd onto an XL266.  Many have offered<br>
suggestions and sent things to try.  If I only wanted unix I would<br>
have settled on Linux, since it is known to run with the ARC console;<br>
however, I was ultimately targeting Digital unix because I need to<br>
use the PL/I compiler (which I wrote, with help from colleagues).<br>
<p>
I thought I would summarize my experience so that anyone else trying<br>
the same thing wouldn't have to duplicate my experiments.<br>
<p>
The XL233/266 machines were designed (probably by marketing) to be NT<br>
only machines, because they were aggessively priced.  Hence, the<br>
flash ROM is only 512KB, big enough to hold the ARC console, but not<br>
also SRM, the latter which is required to boot anything other than<br>
NT.<br>
<p>
The boot sequence on these platforms is as follows:<br>
<p>
	SROM  -&gt;  DROM  -&gt;  ARC<br>
<p>
on the cpu daughterboard are jumpers to prevent the transition from<br>
SROM to DROM (used for manufacturing) and , more importantly, a<br>
jumper to cause the DROM code to load from the failsafe floppy rather<br>
than the ARC console from flash.  Thus, if you trashed your flash,<br>
and had the the right floppy, you could still bring up NT from the<br>
ARC on the floppy.<br>
<p>
I'm not sure of the exact function of the first two stages, because<br>
there is not a lot of documentation available.  I have scoured<br>
Digitals ftp site, and nada.<br>
<p>
I have tried several different firmware images, one of them modified<br>
by Drew at Duke with the mkboot utulity, I have tried using the ARC<br>
update utility, I have tried "RUN A PROGRAM" option under the ARC menu<br>
and they all failed.  This last one failed, I believe, because of an<br>
object code format incompatibility (i.e. header infor, magic number<br>
or the like).  Now to run programs from ARC, it has to be in FAT<br>
format, and you have to give the full path, thus<br>
<p>
scsi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\XLUPDATE.EXE  for drive C<br>
multi(0)disk(0)fdisk(0)\XLUPDATE.EXE<br>
<p>
according to documentation on the ftp site the name has to be as<br>
above for ARC to recognize it, and it has to be FAT<br>
<p>
The images I was trying were based on SRM console, the theory being<br>
that like linux milo you start life FAT and then slim down.<br>
<p>
CONCLUSIONS:<br>
<p>
I have a hunch that the hooks between DROM and ARC are probably the<br>
same as SRM, and I bet that there exists within Digital a failsafe<br>
floppy image of SRM for this platform.  I was operating under the<br>
theory that I could build a floppy image, in lieu of the flash, which<br>
would always be used to boot unix (from SRM).  For the moment, linux<br>
is the only option, Digital unix and netbsd are out.<br>
<p>
For anybody who is interested I have more details.<br>
