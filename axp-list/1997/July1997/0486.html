<i>&gt; I really want to try and stay internal, as this computer will be ported</i><br>
<i>&gt; about quite a bit and so I would like to keep it all together.  Also keeping</i><br>
<i>&gt; the drive internally simplifies 240/120v conversion which I will need as I</i><br>
<i>&gt; will use it both sides of the Atlantic.</i><br>
<p>
I had similar semtinments as well. I like small computers and in truth the<br>
2nd reason I got a UDB was because it was so compact. The first reason was<br>
that it was an alpha of course :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The highest capacity 2.5" SCSI drive I've found is a 800Mb Toshiba one</i><br>
<i>&gt; (please let me know if anyone knows of any higher capacity 2.5" ones).</i><br>
<i>&gt; Whereas I can get a 2Gb IDE Toshiba 2.5" drive for the same cost.  Although</i><br>
<i>&gt; SCSI is traditionally faster than IDE, does this hold with 2.5" drives?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;From the specs both drives have similar av. seek times (about 13ms).</i><br>
<p>
On misc.forsale.workstation, therer was someone selling 1.2 gig scsi 2.5"<br>
harddrives for $1000. That's too steep for my blood but I'll send you the<br>
info in a separate e-mail just in case you are interestd. Its going to be<br>
hard to scsi 2.5" drives for less than 4X the costof IDE drives due to<br>
demand. Very few vendors are shipping laptops with scsi hard drives anymore.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; The machine is going to be used as a personal workstation, doing mainly C,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Latex, Postscript, telnet, Netscape type stuff.  No heavy number crunching</i><br>
<i>&gt; or disk IO.</i><br>
<p>
Hmm. If you aren't gonig to be doing any heavy disk I/O then you might want<br>
to consider going with IDE. The contro<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So what do you think?  Is the SCSI drive going to be significantly faster</i><br>
<i>&gt; than the IDE drive for my requirements?  Will I fit RedHat 4.1 comfortably</i><br>
<i>&gt; into 800Mb with room for 100Mb worth of data files etc?  If I need to I may</i><br>
<i>&gt; invest in an external Zip drive for archiving work on.</i><br>
<p>
For the 166Mhz UDB, the IDE interface is *NOT* enhanced and therefore<br>
severely lacks in performance. I have heard reports that copying a large<br>
file (&gt; 10MB) can take as much 90% of the cpu. You can check the axp-list<br>
archives for the details.<br>
<p>
I am currently running a 166Mhz UDB with an external 1gig scsi hard drive<br>
and an external scsi zip. They both work like a charm and I can get about<br>
30Mbs/minute on the zip. Its great for archiving data since i can just<br>
mount the partition and copy data to it. Much better than having to read<br>
off a streaming device. OF course it only holds 100MB but since you are<br>
only planning on having a 100MB user partition then its the perfect size :-)<br>
<p>
A completel installation of RedHat 4.2 will *NOT* fit comfortabley on a<br>
500MB drive unless you cut out some of the software. The redhat<br>
distribution comes with *TONS* of stuff and it can easily take up 400MB.<br>
And trust me. If you add any other softawre like XEmacs and/or StarOffice<br>
(running under em86 of course) then you are going to quickly go over the<br>
400MB limit. You can amke it though but you are going to have to leave out<br>
software.<br>
<p>
So its a hard decision. If you can afford the money, go for scsi for<br>
performance reasons. If you can't afford the scsi then go with the IDE but<br>
expect performance to suck for any large I/O type jobs.<br>
<p>
hope this helps<br>
