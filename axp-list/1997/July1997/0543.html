<i>&gt;I have noticed that many new UDB/Multia owners have been asking questions</i><br>
<i>&gt;concerning where they can find 2.5" scsi hard drives to be used internall</i><br>
<i>&gt;on their machines. I was also in this category when I first acquired my UDB</i><br>
<i>&gt;but wasn't able to find any information that was satisfactory. I settled</i><br>
<i>&gt;for an external scsi drive and that has been working flawlessly since.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;However, I never gave up on it and recently started looking again. I had</i><br>
<i>&gt;some questions that I wanted to ask to the list populace in the hopes that</i><br>
<i>&gt;I can get more concrete answers this time around. To be quite frank, i'm</i><br>
<i>&gt;not interested in responses that say "why do you want to use an internal</i><br>
<i>&gt;drive?". One of the reasons I bought the UDB was its extremely small and</i><br>
<i>&gt;compact size. :-) </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1) I know that the machine has room for a 3.5" hard drive in it but the</i><br>
<i>&gt;connector on the motherboard is for a 2.5" scsi drive. Are there converters</i><br>
<i>&gt;cables/devices that can be purchased to do this? If so then from who and</i><br>
<i>&gt;how much? </i><br>
No, not that I've seen.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;2) Many folks have said that 3.5" drives produce too much heat for the UDB</i><br>
<i>&gt;and will run the risk of overheating your machine. I wanted to know what</i><br>
<i>&gt;the heat differences were on average between 2.5" drives and 3.5" drives.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Also, are the speed differences that much different between 2.5" and 3.5"</i><br>
<i>&gt;drives? Also, does anyone have an actual 3.5" scsi hard drive in their UDB?</i><br>
Nah, it shouldn't be a problem, Just don't stick 2 drives in it!!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;3) Searching www.dejanews.com with "scsi AND 2.5 AND drive" gave several</i><br>
<i>&gt;results and I have found some folks selling apple drives that are actually</i><br>
<i>&gt;IDE drives with a scsi converter on them. They report to work fine in apple</i><br>
<i>&gt;powerbooks but have some trouble if you try to partition them. I was</i><br>
<i>&gt;wondering if anyone had used one of these (in a UDB or not)? Also, are</i><br>
<i>&gt;these converters available available for free. I know that there are</i><br>
<i>&gt;external cases that turn scsi hard drives into IDE backpack type hard drives</i><br>
<i>&gt;so going the other way seems reasonable as well.</i><br>
And they are slow as hell, and still eat up a lot of CPU time so why bother?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;4) I know that the UDB has a PCI slot. I as wondering if it was possible to</i><br>
<i>&gt;buy a pci EIDE controller card and drive a 2.5" eide drive off of that. It</i><br>
<i>&gt;might require an adapter cable from the card to the drive but that would</i><br>
<i>&gt;allow me to access the much cheaper 2.5" EIDE hard drives and get decent</i><br>
<i>&gt;performance as opposed to using the old IDE controller that is on the UDB</i><br>
<i>&gt;motherboard.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Any answers to these questions would be greatly appreciated.</i><br>
Toshiba 810MB SCSI 2.5" drives are $650.<br>
