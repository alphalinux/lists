As you can tell by now, responding to my post on the axp-list went to the<br>
entire list. I don't know if you intended that but that's what happenend.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   Anyhow , I was wondering whether its worth the money/trouble to get it</i><br>
<i>&gt; working and hoped maybe you would give me your opinion on the UDB's</i><br>
<i>&gt; performance and any thing else that may seem good to know about it. If</i><br>
<i>&gt; this email is an annoyance , my apologies , please do not respond in  </i><br>
<i>&gt; that case.</i><br>
<p>
You are by no means annoying me. Feel free to ask questions to me at any<br>
time. My UDB has been a very nice usable machine. I am a phd student at Ga<br>
Tech and I do research in high perforance computing. My UDB has 40MB of RAM<br>
in it and 1 gig external SCSI hard drive. I use the machine to do my phd<br>
research code development. Its performance is not incredibly stellar. About<br>
the sme speed as a 100Mhz Pentium 100 but I feel that I can get a<br>
reasonable amount of work done on it. I have access to much faster machines<br>
but for coding, debugging, and such its a very reasonable platform. The<br>
more ram you have the better since Linux does really good caching with the<br>
extra ram that you have. I noticed that when i went from 16MB from 40 that<br>
my speed improved dramatically.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    What im wondering most is - how difficult is it to set up, how does</i><br>
<i>&gt; the alpha 166 processor seem to rate against a pentium , and just how</i><br>
<i>&gt; good is the linux port? I have a copy of redhat alpha 4.2 .</i><br>
<p>
Linux Redhat 4.2 on the UDB is incredible. I did an install with absolutely<br>
no problems (although I did it over the network). I set up  X windows with<br>
no trouble as well and had over half of my 1 gig disk still available once<br>
I installed *everything* that was on the cd-rom. The X windows is pretty<br>
swift but won't do more than 8bpp withouth sticking another video card in<br>
the box.<br>
<p>
All in all, I'd say its worth investing in it. The only thing that it uses<br>
that your PC can't use is the parity memory.<br>
