I have noticed that many new UDB/Multia owners have been asking questions<br>
concerning where they can find 2.5" scsi hard drives to be used internall<br>
on their machines. I was also in this category when I first acquired my UDB<br>
but wasn't able to find any information that was satisfactory. I settled<br>
for an external scsi drive and that has been working flawlessly since.<br>
<p>
However, I never gave up on it and recently started looking again. I had<br>
some questions that I wanted to ask to the list populace in the hopes that<br>
I can get more concrete answers this time around. To be quite frank, i'm<br>
not interested in responses that say "why do you want to use an internal<br>
drive?". One of the reasons I bought the UDB was its extremely small and<br>
compact size. :-) <br>
<p>
1) I know that the machine has room for a 3.5" hard drive in it but the<br>
connector on the motherboard is for a 2.5" scsi drive. Are there converters<br>
cables/devices that can be purchased to do this? If so then from who and<br>
how much? <br>
<p>
2) Many folks have said that 3.5" drives produce too much heat for the UDB<br>
and will run the risk of overheating your machine. I wanted to know what<br>
the heat differences were on average between 2.5" drives and 3.5" drives.<br>
Also, are the speed differences that much different between 2.5" and 3.5"<br>
drives? Also, does anyone have an actual 3.5" scsi hard drive in their UDB?<br>
<p>
3) Searching www.dejanews.com with "scsi AND 2.5 AND drive" gave several<br>
results and I have found some folks selling apple drives that are actually<br>
IDE drives with a scsi converter on them. They report to work fine in apple<br>
powerbooks but have some trouble if you try to partition them. I was<br>
wondering if anyone had used one of these (in a UDB or not)? Also, are<br>
these converters available available for free. I know that there are<br>
external cases that turn scsi hard drives into IDE backpack type hard drives<br>
so going the other way seems reasonable as well.<br>
<p>
4) I know that the UDB has a PCI slot. I as wondering if it was possible to<br>
buy a pci EIDE controller card and drive a 2.5" eide drive off of that. It<br>
might require an adapter cable from the card to the drive but that would<br>
allow me to access the much cheaper 2.5" EIDE hard drives and get decent<br>
performance as opposed to using the old IDE controller that is on the UDB<br>
motherboard.<br>
<p>
Any answers to these questions would be greatly appreciated.<br>
<p>
V<br>
b.t.w I worked on the UDB FAQ some more. The latest revision is available at <br>
       ftp.cc.gatech.edu:/pub/groups/systems/vernard/udb/faq.txt <br>
Take a look at it and let me know what you think. <br>
