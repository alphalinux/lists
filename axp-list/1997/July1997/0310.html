Hello,<br>
<p>
I too have observed strange time behaviour on a Miata 433a. After the initial<br>
installation of RH 4.2, and with the time option set to ARC (whose clock is<br>
set to our local time, GMT+2), the system would boot and at first display the<br>
right time. But within a relatively short time, probably less than an hour,<br>
it would jump ahead to a time that was 20 years plus 2 hours in the future,<br>
causing problem for some makefiles... (that's how I noticed first). I now<br>
set the time during boot from a time server on the local ethernet, and this jump<br>
doesn't appear to happen any more (I don't run anything like xntpd to<br>
periodically set the time though - see below). There's however another<br>
weirdness: the clock appears to run consistently fast, by about 15%. <br>
What's intriguing is that that is almost exactly the difference in clock speed<br>
between a 500 MHz and a 433 MHz Alpha... I don't know if it's just a<br>
coincidence, and I don't know how the kernel calibrates the time (is it the<br>
Bogomips code?) but if somewhere constants are used that aply to the 500 MHz<br>
Miata that could explain it. Alternatively, I'd love to believe that DEC made<br>
a mistake and my Miata actually IS running at 500 MHz ... :-)<br>
Now with a timing that's fast by 15%, I think I would have to correct the time<br>
very frequently, to stay within about 1 second of the true time, so I haven't<br>
done that yet. Maybe that isn't too bad a load though, I don't know. <br>
If anyone can shed some light onto this, I'd be grateful!<br>
