<i>&gt;  Am considering moving up from my 14400 modem.  Any</i><br>
<i>&gt;suggestions on the fastest reliable modem?</i><br>
<p>
I've had tremendous luck with my Multi-Tech MT-2834BA, its only drawback <br>
perhaps being that it is a bit pricier than most. The fax implementation <br>
in particular is very good, and it will do UUCP spoofing for less cost <br>
than a Trailblazer.<br>
<p>
If you are considering any of the "56K" units out there you should be <br>
aware that they can attain speeds in excess if 33.6 only under special <br>
conditions and only in one direction.<br>
<p>
Basically you have to be connecting (usually a large ISP) whose units <br>
connect to the telco in the digital domain. This eliminates on <br>
analog-digital transition and can thus allow faster speed (although NEVER <br>
as fast as 56K, even with a perfect phone line). The speed advantage is <br>
only in one direction (provider to you) and you are still limited to a <br>
(theoretical) max of 33.6 from you to the provider.<br>
<p>
"Concentrators" used by a lot of local telcos also have an adverse effect <br>
on the performance of these units, and there is virtually no way to know <br>
if your home phone is going through one of these unless you are friendly <br>
with your local phone company techs.<br>
<p>
These units are essentially designed for somebody who wants to download <br>
quickly from a large provider like AOL, providing, of course that you <br>
have chosen the same flavor of 56K unit that your provider has. You can <br>
NEVER get more than 33.6 with two of these units talking to each other, <br>
since one end has to be the "digital" unit on a T1 line or similar.<br>
<p>
The above limitations, plus the lack of a standard at this time, would <br>
lead me to suggest that you stick with one of the established-brand 33.6 <br>
units at this time.<br>
<p>
Sorry if this is a bit off-topic, but it was asked on this list.<br>
