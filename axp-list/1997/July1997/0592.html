Hi, Markus,<br>
<p>
There should be no problem getting your miata running, as i am running <br>
one myself, other than the fact that I still get unaligned traps, and my <br>
CDrom doesn't play audio CDs though my sound card is working, and the <br>
machine seems to run slower than it was under NT .... Nonethless, Linux <br>
on miata works.<br>
<p>
I used the miata-kernel-2029.gz (something like that). To enable your <br>
ethernet card, you would need to put in some boot prompt option. We are <br>
using the BNC port, so I have to add:<br>
<p>
ether=0,0,2,eth0 <br>
<p>
to the boot prompt in order to get the ethernet card to work. After <br>
which, should you need to recompile a custom kernel, you would need to <br>
download the latest tulip.c to drive the 21142 ethernet card. I can't <br>
remember the place to get tulip.c, but I could email it to you in private <br>
if you need it.<br>
<p>
For milo and loadlin, I've found that the ones come with RH4.2 works <br>
perfectly fine for me, so you could probably stick to them. <br>
<p>
After which, I guess you would be trying to get X up. After running <br>
Xconfigurator, you would need to do this:<br>
<p>
ln -s Alcor /etc/alpha_systype<br>
<p>
Without which, X would never come up.<br>
<p>
Since you mentioned you are quite new to Linux, I would imagine that you <br>
would probably run into the same problems as I have, since I am pretty <br>
inexperienced myself. I managed to my system up after many helpful advice <br>
from fellow list members, so I thought I should share it with you, <br>
hopefully to help save some headache in the process.<br>
<p>
Good luck!<br>
<p>
