Some time ago, there was a discussion on this list about getting<br>
Xemacs working and a number of patches were written by various<br>
people. The upshot being that Xemacs 19.16 was persuaded to work on<br>
the alpha. (I remember compiling and running it successfully.)<br>
<p>
I've recently downloaded the new Xemacs 20.3 release and have been<br>
looking through the source. It seems that some of the patches made it<br>
to the Xemacs team and have been incorporated into the main<br>
source. However, the darned thing still doesn't build properly! There<br>
are lots of warnings about UNEXEC being defined twice (which is a good<br>
sign something is wrong) and then it stops in the inet code<br>
complaining about conflicting types for ntohl. Whilst I'm sure I could<br>
hack at this, I'd rather consult the people who worked on xemacs<br>
before, to find out what needs doing. (I'm pretty sure the problems<br>
are identical with those that happened before, although the old<br>
patches clearly won't work with the newer sources.)<br>
<p>
Has anyone yet put together a set of patches for the 20.x Xemacs<br>
sources? (I'm aware that it is a seperate source tree from the 19.x<br>
Xemacs. I know it's definitely possible to get it going, because<br>
people sometimes release compiled alpha/linux binaries. For some<br>
reason these always like to have shared files in strange places, and<br>
so on, though, and it would be nice for people to be able to build<br>
their own version.<br>
<p>
I'd quite like to build a proper Redhat xemacs package, as we've<br>
waited long enough for it on the alpha! But without knowing how I need<br>
to mutilate it to make sure it works *properly* (I can't test<br>
everything!) this would be an unwise thing to do.<br>
<p>
Can anyone help?<br>
<p>
Best wishes,<br>
<p>
Chris.<br>
