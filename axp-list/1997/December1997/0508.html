Hi,<br>
  OK - I've finally got PPP and mail going on my LX; here are some<br>
soloutions and some problems I hope people can help me with:<br>
<p>
  1) PPP - if your PPP is stuck upgrade your kernel! I built a 2.1.63<br>
     kernel from standard unpatched 2.1.63 sources and it works fine.<br>
     (Its doing this!!).  My old PPP scripts worked with very minor<br>
     tweaking using the RH5.0 distribution pppd/chat.<br>
<p>
     If you have an LX tell the 2.1.63 config you have a PC164 and its<br>
     fine.<br>
<p>
  2) Compilation giving multiply defined FD_SET and the like.  Upgrade<br>
     upgrade your kernel - problems disappeared with 2.1.63; glibc doesn't<br>
     like 2.0.30??<br>
<p>
  3) C++ programs crash with seg faults in system functions (typically<br>
     fclose). This problem seems to be caused by libio being in both<br>
     libstdc++ and glibc - you get conflicting symbol errors if you try<br>
     -static - has anyone got a fix for this????<br>
<p>
  4) Has anyone got a webbrowser binary for Linux/Alpha? Other than Lynx!<br>
     I'm trying to build the KDE stuff, but due to (3) and the fact that<br>
     the old version of EGCS I have crashes if I try that instead I'm<br>
     failing.<br>
<p>
  5) Soundcard - I have a soundblaster 16 value; true creative labs -<br>
     works fine on Linux/x86 - how do I get it to work on Alpha? I tried<br>
     building the sound drivers (in 2.0.30) in the same way as for intel<br>
     and one of my EIDE channels stopped working - presumably due to<br>
     an interrupt screw up??? How to ISA interrupts map to the interrupts<br>
     and addresses seen by the kernel??<br>
<p>
  6) Beep - I haven't heard my machine beep from its motherboard speaker<br>
     at all - I presume this is a fault in the hardware (for which I'm NOT<br>
     sending it back!). Can anyone suggest any other problem which could<br>
     cause silence.<br>
<p>
  7) Matrox Millenium II - get corruption on your xterms? Turn off<br>
     acceleration using the 'Option "noaccel"' line in the Section<br>
     "Device" part.<br>
<p>
  8) Any one had any look with EGCS and -mCPU=21164? I get assembler<br>
     errors (I'm on EGCS 971127).<br>
<p>
  9) If you add an IDE device after installing onto SCSI the AlphaBIOS<br>
     moves the device numbers and you'll have to change the OS loader<br>
     settings.  Even when adding just a CDROM (which doesn't constitute <br>
     another disc) this happens.<br>
<p>
 10) When building the 2.1.x kernels note that the VGA console and TGA<br>
     console options have been merged into one 'TGA instead' option.<br>
     So where as on 2.0.30 you could define both, if on 2.1.x you define<br>
     the TGA you get no kernel output displayed.<br>
<p>
 11) On 2.1.63 the Adaptec 2940 drivers have a small piece of x86<br>
assembler in - but the routine isn't called anywhere; comment the code out<br>
and your fine.<br>
<p>
 12) Remember to comment out the SMP =1 line in the Makefile. Note:<br>
     setting SMP=0 screws up!<br>
<p>
 13) 2.1.63 feels a lot more responsive and memory careful - and you get<br>
     the option of setting the SCSI bus pause period after reset :-)<br>
<p>
Finally:<br>
*  NOTE: I have had mail problems over the last few days - things may  *<br>
*  have bounced                                                        *<br>
<p>
  I'm not sure about this - but after 1.5 days of trying to get PPP going<br>
I only had 6 messages - most of which disappeared! I am using fetchmail<br>
to get mail via PPP but I forgot that my service provider will deliver<br>
mail via SMTP automatically - and sendmail was running but badly<br>
configured.<br>
  I haven't seen any errors, messages or anything which would indicate<br>
lost mail - but neither have I seen the mail; I'm guessing there were<br>
bounces with user unknown errors but I do not know. If those came<br>
to you  - sorry!!<br>
