What the Opera developers have proposed is indeed very unconventional, but<br>
there is nothing inherantly wrong with it.  This is their method of<br>
ensuring their success in the scary world of alternative platforms.  This<br>
is also the method employed by a lot of people outside the software<br>
industry, such as general contractors and such, where a portion of the<br>
money is fronted in good faith, and a portion of the work completed or all<br>
work completed for final payment.  The difference with software is that a<br>
portion of the work is worth nothing, in general.  While you may be<br>
opposed to their method, it is (as myself and others would see it) a<br>
invaluable opportunity for us as users to get a truly good product ported<br>
to our operating system.  There is always a risk involved in trying to<br>
sell to a minority market, and I think that if the Opera people didn't get<br>
these pledges beforehand, their product on that platform would never<br>
surface.  Why should they take that risk?  In addition to the code, they<br>
must also pay for maintenance, updates, and support.  They obviously know<br>
the Win32x model, but they'll have to learn the PM model, and the Mac<br>
model, and the Motif model.  And they're going to have to deal with<br>
potentially quite irate users because their design philosophy is not<br>
seamless with the users' OS.  All this costs money, and can be quite<br>
expensive.  Why would they take that venture if they can't prove that it<br>
is going to be cost effective to do so?  They way I see it, this is the<br>
industry looking to the users and asking, "Hey, what do you want?  We're<br>
here _for_ you," not, "We are Microsoft.  You will be paperclip Bob." <br>
Again, while you may disagree with buying something that does not exist<br>
yet (I sure hope you aren't as stubborn with other investments) I think it<br>
was an invaluable opportunity for the users of those operating systems to<br>
show that OS/2 and Macintosh have a viable user market, and should not be<br>
abondoned for Windoze.  (Not to be Anti-Linux, but that proof never<br>
surfaced.)  And isn't that what people complain about most with<br>
'alternate' OSes?  Lack of vendor support?<br>
