  It seems you still don't understand.  That is completely not the<br>
case.  They are basically just taking a survey to see who will buy the<br>
product if they decide to create it.  They are giving the Alpha Linux<br>
community a chance to convince them its worth the effort to make the<br>
port, and attitudes like yours are certainly discouraging.  You don't<br>
have to pay them before they do the work.<br>
<p>
% mind-set.  I re-iterate is anyone interested in writing a browser for the<br>
% alpha? <br>
<p>
I'd love to see a GNU browser.  The w3c released the code to their old<br>
browser to the public domain I believe. <br>
