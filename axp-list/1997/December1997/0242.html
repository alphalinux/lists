<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; "Maurice W. Hilarius" said:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; With regards to your message at 03:52 AM 12-06-97 -0800, Bill Broadley.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Where you stated:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Apparently the LX motherboard was either designed with a poor eide chip,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;or doesn't take full advantage.  Doesn't seem fixable.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Somewhat. It (and all the other Alpha boards) don't have UltraDMA or any of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the other new fancy EIDE interfaces. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Anyone know if the SX is similiarly low performing in the area of EIDE?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Seems like EIDE would be more important on the more price sensitive</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;SX configurations.    Any ideas, experiences etc?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Same chips basically. Nobady at DEC Semi apparently believed that anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; serious would use IDE. Why they even put it on the boards at all is a bit</i><br>
<i>&gt; of a mystery to me.. The real estate could have been used for onboard</i><br>
<i>&gt; ethernet for example, at about the same cost.</i><br>
<p>
For the record, the AlphaPC164-SX uses:<br>
<p>
"Cypress CY82C693U Hypercache / Stand-Alone PCI Peripheral Controller with USB"<br>
<p>
to provide a PCI to ISA bridge along with some of the standard ISA devices:<br>
IDE, RTC, keyboard/mouse, and DMA controllers (serial/parallel/diskette are<br>
provided by a separate SMC chip, the FDC37C935).<br>
<p>
Here's what the Cypress documentation says about the IDE on this chip:<br>
<p>
"The CY82C693U contains an integrated, dual-channel PCI to IDE bridge. The<br>
IDE controller conforms to ANSI modes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 for PIO (Programmed<br>
I/O) transfers. Single word and multi-word DMA transfer modes 0, 1, and 2<br>
are also supported. ATAPI (CD-ROM) protocols are allowed with pre-fetching<br>
disabled. The controller allows for CHS (cylinder-Head-Sector) or LBA<br>
(Logical Block Address) addressing. Each of the tweo channels support two<br>
devices for a maximum of four IDE devices in the system. The controller<br>
allows for PIO pre-fetching, post writing, and DMA PCI mastering in order to<br>
increase overall system performance."<br>
<p>
Also stated later in the document:<br>
<p>
"IDE DMA is compatible with SFF-8038i (the Small Form Factor Committee<br>
specification defining bus mastering on IDE). Only 16-bit DMA operation is<br>
supported."<br>
<p>
And it goes on to say that it supports scatter-gather as well.<br>
<p>
Sounds like a case of "the hardware is willing but the software is weak" to me.<br>
<p>
Now, as to prior motherboards, like PC164 and LX164, those use a CMD 646<br>
PCI IDE chipset. These are also capable of DMA and bus mastering, I believe.<br>
But there's no LINUX driver for it that I am aware of, probably because:<br>
<p>
1. its predecessor, the CMD 640 was very broken, and was rightly shunned by<br>
   most INTEL motherboard manufacturers.<br>
<p>
2. those same manufacturers were reluctant to employ the CMD 646, because of<br>
   how bad the 640 was, so few mobos were built with it, and so no driver.<br>
<p>
The above is, of course, pure speculation on my part, but it seems to fit.<br>
Now, as to why the DEC mobo designers chose the 646, I'm not going to guess,<br>
but it prolly was influenced by the ease of implementation.<br>
<p>
As to this being a problem only the Alpha has (poor IDE performance when<br>
using the PIO driver), I think you should check the archives of the<br>
linux-kernel list on vger.rutgers.edu. I can personally vouch for the fact<br>
that within the last two months there was great hue and cry from some<br>
posters there about how bad IDE was; I had to keep checking the Email<br>
address to make sure it wasn't from axp-list... :-\<br>
<p>
I thought my kids held the record for whining, but I'm having second thoughts<br>
right about now... :-( :-( :-(<br>
