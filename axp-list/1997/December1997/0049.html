Oh well, I thought PnP cards would be easy to config with isapnptools,<br>
but has anyone had any luck with SB AWE64 Value and especially<br>
Alpha XL-300 (or XLT)? ;-)<br>
<p>
I'm not at my Alpha right now so I cannot send any real output,<br>
but I took pnpdump's output, modified it suitable and run isapnp<br>
with it.  Now the card is recognized by sound module (that one which<br>
came in 2.1.65) and also FM Synthesizer is found, something like:<br>
- SB16 at 0x300, irq 5, drq 1,5 (actual audio part, I think)<br>
- SB16 at 0x330, irq 5, drq 0  (MPU-401 part)<br>
- FM synth at 0x388<br>
<p>
and /dev/audio and /dev/dsp seem to work (at least output).<br>
<p>
But wave table part is not found, after FM synth the sound module<br>
tells "AWE32 not detected".  So, from that I think I have successfully<br>
compiled in the lowlevel driver (AWE32) but it isn't found.  Pnpdump<br>
report tells that Wavetable's ioport should be 0x620 but that's reserved<br>
on XLT.  According to Creative's WWW page, also 0xa?0 and 0xe?0<br>
are possible and I tried some addresses (e.g. 0x0a00, 0x0a20, 0xe00,<br>
0x0e20) but I'm still waveless.<br>
<p>
<p>
Before I go and try every single address manually, has someone<br>
got this working and could perhaps provide me with the suitable<br>
ioport address?  Before anyone asks, I did try that suggested 0x620<br>
one, but it didn't work (neither did it cause any harm although it<br>
apparently is reserved for something).<br>
<p>
Or is it just impossible and I should choose a PCI card?  (Or live<br>
without wavetable... in which case I would have chosen some basic<br>
SB16 card in the first place.)<br>
<p>
<p>

<p>
P.S. as a last thought, could it be that this card is too new for<br>
that sound driver?  It is AWE64 and all that, but it is made in 1997<br>
and manual is printed on September '97... perhaps Creative has<br>
changed something recently?<br>
