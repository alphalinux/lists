I have a CL-GD5464-HC-A based PCI video card with 4Meg of "RDRAM"?!  The tga video in the Multia works great, but 8 bit color is pretty lame these days.  I have Intel NT and 95 drivers for it, but I doubt there's a driver for it for Linux or Alpha NT.  Anybody got one?  Anyway, I'm gonna stick the sucker in there and see what explodes.  ;-)<br>
<p>
Is the card in your 486 a PCI?<br>
<p>
You should be able to find the 70-nano true-parity simms that DEC specifies.  Get 64M - the Multia needs all the RAM it can get (and then some if you run mondo-dog NT on the poor thing).<br>
<p>
IDE drives show up in the arc menu as "multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)".  The SCSI disks are "scsi(0)disk(0)...<br>
My Multia _warm_ boots fine off the IDE _after_, I said _AFTER_, it cold boots from the SCSI drive.  Since the IDE is the default boot device, I get a boot menu error message on a cold boot, unless I select my alternate SCSI boot selection (I have a backup copy of the boot and os partitions on the SCSI drive).<br>
<p>
Once it cold boots off the SCSI disk, I can warm boot from the IDE.  I would really appreciate someone explaining what's up with that?!?  Other than that little problem, the Multia is really reliable.  Plus it takes some of the load off our central heating and doubles as a toaster!!<br>
<p>
Happy holidays!<br>

Hmmn... if NT detects the IDE interface, then chances are, Linux will<br>
too, if I boot off a floppy...<br>
<p>
What kind of video card do you want to try to use?  The guy at Starship<br>
said that only certain kinds of cards will work... he told me to try an<br>
older S3 based card, which luckily is what I have sitting in my 486.<br>
<p>
I tried 16 different 4 and 16 meg parity SIMMS, all of which tested OK<br>
on a memory tester, and I got nothing... not even with my own video<br>
card... so I sent the unit back yesterday.<br>
<p>
Hmmn... from what I understand of ARC (I haven't used it yet), you can<br>
tell it which partition of which disk to boot off of... and you can't<br>
tell it to use the IDE disk instead of the SCSI disk?  Interesting. <br>
Though, since the firmware is flash-upgradeable, maybe I could hack<br>
MILO to use the IDE disk and blast it into flash memory...<br>
<p>
I can't wait to get this bad boy up and running... :)  Especially since<br>
I've got the Alpha port of Quake... hehehehehe...<br>
<p>
Later,<br>
