Users,<br>
    Here's the problem (Going to try to give as much info as possible), =<br>
I am<br>
running RedHat Linux 5 on an Dec Alpha Multia 166 using a Motorola =<br>
External<br>
56K, I know the modem and cable are functioning fine as I have had this<br>
working under Windows NT for the same alpha box.<br>
    Here's the Linux scenario:<br>
        When I boot Minicom the modem functions fine no problems at all;<br>
but, if from command line, script or from the Control Panel:Networking =<br>
in<br>
xwindows ppp(dialout) fails (RD&amp;SD lights light up but modem does not =<br>
act on<br>
the command sent).To top it off, any commands that are sent to the modem<br>
from command line or script, the RD and SD lights light up, then the =<br>
modem<br>
does not respond and finally the system freezes leaving with no option =<br>
but<br>
to coldboot and we all know what that does to Linux files :-&lt;<br>
    Things that I do know (or at least pretty sure)<br>
        1. Cable is fine<br>
        2. Modem seems to be functioning (working under NT on same box)<br>
        3. Serial port does not seem to be conflicting (check =<br>
/proc/ioports<br>
/proc/irq /proc/pci<br>
        4. Modem works in minicom ONLY!<br>
        5. Had same problems with USR 28.8 external.<br>
        6. Serial port on Apha Box seems to only support 57600 bps not<br>
110bps<br>
I've been at this for a week and could not solve the problem, if anyone =<br>
has<br>
any suggestions anything at all, please write. I've already purchased a<br>
gallon of gasoline and a lighter if I can't fix this prob within the =<br>
next<br>
week, well no more Alpha :-) Btw somewhat new at linux so, keep =<br>
suggestions<br>
laymen please.<br>
Thanks in Advance<br>
