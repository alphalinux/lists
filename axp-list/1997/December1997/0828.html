Hi there!<br>
<i>&gt; I am trying to upgrade my noname from RH4.2 to %.0 mainly due to the need</i><br>
<i>&gt; of a stable glibc (or better then what is running.)  I am able to boot,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and start the upgrade selection using the harddrive.  I am running scsi</i><br>
<i>&gt; HDD, but when it begins to scan for packages to upgrade it sig11's and</i><br>
<i>&gt; thats then end.  Has anyone had this problem or not.  I tried to manually</i><br>
<p>
Unfortunately I have *bought* the RH5 CD-set and I'm struck with the same<br>
set of errors on an AXP5000 (vobis,pc164) machine which is a completely diffe-<br>
rent set of hardware so I doubt it's a hardware problem. Even a new install<br>
ends with 'install ended abnormally - received sig 11' after determining<br>
the mount points for the new install.( For those wishing details: the upgrade<br>
bombs out after displaying the box "finding packages to upgrade")<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; upgrade my glibc to 2.0.5 withouth upgrading the whole OS, as the release</i><br>
<i>&gt; of rh5.0 was not announced till 2 weeks after this attempt.  Could I have</i><br>
<i>&gt; overlooked something in trying to upgrade this machine?  Any help would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; appreciated.</i><br>
<p>
No, I think it's RH who didn't test their alpha release.<br>
<p>
They simply copied their intel crap on the alpha release/CD and sold it.<br>
<p>
This shows up clearly when you try to do an ftp install and have no recog-<br>
nised network card in your machine: the install tries to insmod the net-<br>
work card module and complains about not finding /bin/insmod which is proof<br>
enough for the incompetence of that person doing the alpha dist: RH simply<br>
don't support modules on alpha.<br>
<p>
You can't even install/upgrade single modules because rpm -U complains about<br>
(null) archives and coredumps although the files are there, not empty and<br>
rpm -qlp lists all the files expected in them and after converting them to<br>
cpio's can be extracted. Switching to the new rpm from the CD doesn't help<br>
(independent of g/libc issues since rpm is *statically* linked).<br>
<p>
So my solution is: get all the sources, compile them yourself and put RH on<br>
your 'banned' list. I won't buy anything from them again since they put me<br>
off for the third time now (Just *my* decision). I'll try the Debian alpha<br>
as soon as it is available, can't be worse.<br>
<p>
Since RH5 was released Dec 1. and I bought my CD on Dec 24 and there is no<br>
better version available from RH I think all those people that downloaded<br>
RH5 for free and tried it have silently dropped it and are using RH4.2.<br>
I am still using a RH4.1 system with some packages and kernel upgrades and<br>
even that install couldn't be done with the original CD but only by a net-<br>
work install from my i386 machine. Now even that is impossible.<br>
<p>
I'm sorry that I can't help you. I think we're on our own now.<br>
