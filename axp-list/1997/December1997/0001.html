Thanks to those who replied to my inquiry. Basically I received three<br>
answers: <br>
<p>
	a) The 'gravis ultrasound ace' works. All PnP cards tried<br>
	   didn't work.<br>
<p>
	b) SoundBlaster PnP cards work fine, by using the isapnptool <br>
	   utilities.<br>
<p>
	c) SoundBlaster PnP cards programmed to non-PnP mode by<br>
           DOS/Intel utilities available from Creative's web side.<br>
<p>
Well, I wasn't able to get the GUS card, and I don't own an Intel<br>
(but I wasn't able to find those utilites, either), so I went for b).<br>
That worked, but almost any tool needed some patches.<br>
<p>
First problem, to compile the sound driver as a module on the Jensen,<br>
it was necessary to include _bus_outb and _bus_inb in<br>
linux/arch/alpha/ksyms.c.<br>
<p>
Although downloaded from Redhat's devel tree, the isapnptool needed to be<br>
patched, too. Simply comment out the 'ioperm' calls. Apart from that<br>
the tools worked fine. I used 'pnpdump' to get a list of supported<br>
features, edited that, and now 'isapnp' is used to initialize the<br>
card during startup. Later the sound driver is loaded as a module.<br>
<p>
The card I bought, advertised as "SoundBlaster 16 VALUE PnP", model<br>
ct4170 -- not listed on Creative's web site yet -- apparently doesn't<br>
support 16 bit DMA. So it was necessary to answer "1" to the related<br>
question during sound setup. I guess this degrades performance, so I<br>
felt sort of ripped off by that buy.<br>
	<br>
Various sound playing utilities needed patches to get them 64 bit<br>
clean. I will try to make these patches, as well as the ones mentioned<br>
above, available from my web page the next days. Also I am going to<br>
send them to the authors. In case you like to try them at once,<br>
just mail me.  <br>
<p>
