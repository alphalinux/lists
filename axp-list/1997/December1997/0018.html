Which would not contribute back to the community in the spirit in which <br>
the originals were done.  Some people have different ethics, but I don't<br>
think that companies like RedHat should stoop to that level, and hopefully <br>
there are enough consumers like me to keep them in business.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; i do not see any reason that is stopping redhat from doing this...</i><br>
<i>&gt; i think that the lack of attempt to prevent 'cheapbytes'-like</i><br>

<p>
One might also argue that they are encouraging other companies to <br>
follow in their stead and contribute back to the community.<br>
<p>
Companies like RedHat made people like me eat their words when it came to <br>
the commercialization of Linux.  Caldera has also made significant<br>
contributions back into the source tree.  There are other companies which <br>
profit in cooperation with the community instead of because of it.  <br>
<p>
Not putting iron doors on houses could be said to encourage kick burgling, <br>
that still doesn't make the theif right, or someone I'd buy a TV from.<br>
