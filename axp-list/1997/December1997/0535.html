Well put Christopher.  I have already paid them $35 because I believe is <br>
supporting good software.  Some people have suggested writing their own <br>
browser - that is stupid.  Why reinvent the wheel, when it costs $35.<br>
Focus your eneergies on something really creative.<br>
<p>
Send your pledges folks.<br>

<i>&gt; What the Opera developers have proposed is indeed very unconventional, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; there is nothing inherantly wrong with it.  This is their method of</i><br>
<i>&gt; ensuring their success in the scary world of alternative platforms.  This</i><br>
<i>&gt; is also the method employed by a lot of people outside the software</i><br>
<i>&gt; industry, such as general contractors and such, where a portion of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; money is fronted in good faith, and a portion of the work completed or all</i><br>
<i>&gt; work completed for final payment.  The difference with software is that a</i><br>
<i>&gt; portion of the work is worth nothing, in general.  While you may be</i><br>
<i>&gt; opposed to their method, it is (as myself and others would see it) a</i><br>
<i>&gt; invaluable opportunity for us as users to get a truly good product ported</i><br>
<i>&gt; to our operating system.  There is always a risk involved in trying to</i><br>
<i>&gt; sell to a minority market, and I think that if the Opera people didn't get</i><br>
<i>&gt; these pledges beforehand, their product on that platform would never</i><br>
<i>&gt; surface.  Why should they take that risk?  In addition to the code, they</i><br>
<i>&gt; must also pay for maintenance, updates, and support.  They obviously know</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Win32x model, but they'll have to learn the PM model, and the Mac</i><br>
<i>&gt; model, and the Motif model.  And they're going to have to deal with</i><br>
<i>&gt; potentially quite irate users because their design philosophy is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; seamless with the users' OS.  All this costs money, and can be quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; expensive.  Why would they take that venture if they can't prove that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is going to be cost effective to do so?  They way I see it, this is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; industry looking to the users and asking, "Hey, what do you want?  We're</i><br>
<i>&gt; here _for_ you," not, "We are Microsoft.  You will be paperclip Bob." </i><br>
<i>&gt; Again, while you may disagree with buying something that does not exist</i><br>
<i>&gt; yet (I sure hope you aren't as stubborn with other investments) I think it</i><br>
<i>&gt; was an invaluable opportunity for the users of those operating systems to</i><br>
<i>&gt; show that OS/2 and Macintosh have a viable user market, and should not be</i><br>
<i>&gt; abondoned for Windoze.  (Not to be Anti-Linux, but that proof never</i><br>
<i>&gt; surfaced.)  And isn't that what people complain about most with</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'alternate' OSes?  Lack of vendor support?</i><br>
