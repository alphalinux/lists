I decided to break down and get a nice fast external SCSI disk for my trusty<br>
UDB. I then proceeded to install RH5.0 from scratch. All went well until it<br>
went to reboot. The reboot got hung at the sendmail init for about 10<br>
minutes. Then again at the httpd init. Then again at the smbd init. After<br>
about an hour, it finished booting. Thinking the problem might have been the<br>
(bug that was fixed in a previous release) /etc/nsswitch.conf file, I copied<br>
that to the new /etc and rebooted. No joy.<br>
All the wondermous new system utils were worthless because X windows<br>
wouldn't come up. I'd get the pattern background and X cursor but nothing<br>
else. X would just beep at a mouse click. Had to bail using ctl-alt-bs.<br>
Tried xdm, it's REALLY cool looking now. Didn't help, though.<br>
<p>
A little more digging, however, turned up that the /etc/hosts file only had<br>
one line in it, the localhost line. The 5.0 install script had failed to put<br>
the machine's own host name in the /etc/hosts! Adding this made the boot<br>
come up like magic. Sendmail, httpd, smbd, and X evidently really wanted to<br>
know what the hostname is of the machine they're being run on. Not sure if<br>
the 'fix' I used is the right one, but it did the trick.<br>
<p>
Most folks prolly don't see the problem since they're connected to the<br>
Internet directly or have a nameserver running on their local net and thus<br>
can resolve their own hostname. Since I use my machine AS the<br>
gateway/nameserver to dial-up, it's stand-alone. Therefore, there was no way<br>
to resolve its own host name since the RH install script didn't file it...<br>
<p>
If I find any more minor boo-boo's that cause major heartaches, I'll let<br>
folks know...<br>
