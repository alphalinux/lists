With regards to your message at 12:07 PM 12-06-97 -0500, Craig Burley.<br>
Where you stated:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;According to what we have heard from DEC so far, it's supposed to be pretty</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;solid. Of course so were the denials of the Intel deal...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Heh...well, I don't recall exactly what was written here, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;when I talked to my friend (who works for Digital, for awhile</i><br>
<i>&gt;as one of its spokemen) after the article, he was very careful</i><br>
<i>&gt;about saying "we are not saying it is true, we are not saying</i><br>
<i>&gt;it is false".  And, it turned out to be false, that is, I thought</i><br>
<i>&gt;it was saying Digital was selling *Alpha* to Intel as part of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;deal, and that didn't happen.  (Well, not yet.  ;-)  Personally,</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm *much* happier that only Intel's *chip-making* expertise is</i><br>
<i>&gt;getting its hands on Digital's facilities, than if (as I gathered</i><br>
<i>&gt;was the claim of the article) Intel's *CPU-designing* expertise</i><br>
<i>&gt;got its hands on Digital's Alpha architecture.</i><br>
<p>
But they did. One of the biggest motivating factors for Intel to do the<br>
deal was to get out from the lawsuits filed against it for stealing Digital<br>
architecture for Pentium class CPUs. I suspect that some of the technology<br>
is going to make Merced a lot easier too.<br>
The biggest gain for Intel was the way that t (inevitably) handled by the<br>
Wintel press. If you read the big readership magazines, html news sites,<br>
etc. ( PC Mag, PC World, and all the rest of the Ziff Davis Windows empire,<br>
for example) you get one clear message:<br>
<p>
Alpha is dead. Digital lost. Intel won.<br>
<p>
Frankly, I think Intel won too. DEC got $700 MILLION dollars for<br>
Semiconductor. Did they re-invest it into more R&amp;D? All I have heard of is<br>
the handful of people going to TOEM division, and the 2000 or so going to<br>
work for Intel.<br>
<p>
Semiconductor was the division that brought us the affordable motherboards<br>
and CPUs that most of us run Linux on. We now see the next generation of<br>
boards that are NT only, basically. OK, Linux will run on them, but not<br>
UNIX. 64 bit PCI slots? Gone. SRM? Doubtful at best. We should thank our<br>
lucky stars that we still seem to have Jay++, Jon, Jim and others still<br>
involved. Apparently Dave Rusling is now an Intelite, I hear.<br>
<p>
Enough doom and gloom. At least Samsung is running with the ball, and  with<br>
more Linux enthusiasm than we ever saw before. Their literature lists 2<br>
"software options" for the Alpha: NT and Linux. This is, I believe, a<br>
first. I think it is the first major hardware maker to EVER recognise and<br>
list Linux as an operating system, not just as a passing note of curiousity.<br>
<p>
And the UX and BX boards are going to make a certain impact on the Alpha<br>
market.<br>
Remeber that posting this week from the lady looking for ISA ethernet and<br>
video for an LX system? That's a vendor building a machine, but finding<br>
that 4 PCI slots aren't enough.<br>
Ruffian (UX &amp; BX) will certainly help that problem. I also know of a<br>
third-party manufacturer about to release an UltraDMA33 EIDE 64 bit PCI<br>
card for the Alpha boards. In the words of their Vice-President, and the<br>
man responsible for marketing "Now that some serious players ( Samsung) are<br>
involved in marketing the Alpha, we believe that the market will become<br>
sizable enough to make this board profitable. We also believe that we will<br>
derive enough revenue fron the Linux Alpha market to make releasing drivers<br>
for Linux worthwhile"<br>
Now THAT is progress!<br>
At COMDEX I saw quite a few 64 bit PCI cards. What do we think they are<br>
designed for? Alpha! Yes, there are also Sun boards with PCI and 64 bit,<br>
but they are VERY few.<br>
Every single one of those 64 bit PCI board makers I spoke to at COMDEX are<br>
releasing with, or plan to release Linux drivers for them in the next 3<br>
months.<br>
<p>
&lt;/soapbox&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
