No - you don't have to execute both possibilities to qualify for saying a <br>
processor does speculative execution - and I doubt that the 21264 does<br>
do both possibilities.<br>
<p>
All that speculative execution means is executing an instruction<br>
when your not sure if its going to execute or not. So consider<br>
a little loop:<br>
<p>
          set x 1000<br>
  loop<br>
          some-work<br>
          decr x        &lt;- I mean x=x-1<br>
          if x&gt;0 goback to loop<br>
          something-else<br>
<p>
When we get to the 'if' we could stop there and<br>
wait for the decrement to finish and then go back to the loop.<br>
But thats slow.<br>
<p>
With speculative execution we make a guess; in this case 'hmm<br>
a backward branch - thats probably a loop, lets guess thats done'.<br>
So we make a note of the current state (not quite..) and start executing<br>
some-work.  If the branch happened thats fine, we don't do anything else.<br>
If the branch didn't happen then we restore the state from the note<br>
we made and then carry on at something else. (The not quite is<br>
the fact that we have to include the state of the not finished<br>
stuff before the branch).<br>
<p>
Now this is fairly efficient - if we are good at guessing we rarely<br>
throw any work away - although we do need that hardware to hold<br>
the state just in case we are wrong.<br>
<p>
If we're desperate for more speed we go and execute both sides - so<br>
we always execute some-work and something-else and then choose the<br>
appropriate result.  But thats hopelessly unefficent - you waste<br>
50% of your work. OK if your desperate for all out speed - but its<br>
complex, and its a waste of 50% of your work. This is still a form<br>
of speculative execution - but its a more aggressive one.<br>
<p>
So how does the superscalar help - well say the loop bodies were REALLY<br>
simple; you could execute an instruction of one loop on one functional<br>
unit and an instruction of the next loop on another functuional unit.<br>
So we might be able to do the some-work on one functiuonal unit<br>
while doing the decr of the previous loop on another functional<br>
unit (probably while working out the branch at the same time).<br>
<p>
If the loop bodies are interdependent then you still have to wait<br>
for results - so in the example above you couldn't run two decr's<br>
in parallel because one needs the result of the other<br>
<p>
With superscalar you really need some speculative execution otherwise<br>
you wait around for branches most of the time and never actually<br>
have any instructions to feed your functional units with.<br>
If your a good guesser then you can keep two (on a good day) of your<br>
4 functional units busy. The art is in getting the compiler to generate<br>
code which is organised so that it can keep as many functional<br>
units on the run as possible.<br>
<p>
So are there any dhrystone figures for the 21264 yet? (and I thought<br>
it was going to be clocked faster?).<br>
