Had a couple of interesting issues:<br>
<p>
1. I noticed the system did not seem to be mounting my paging volume,<br>
so I did mkswap /dev/sdb2.  mkswap couldn't deduce the size of the<br>
partition, so picked something over 5 Gig [for about a 120 Meg<br>
partition on a 4 Gig drive].  I killed it, but eventually the root<br>
file system evaporated [on /dev/sdb1] and I've done a reinstall.<br>
<p>
2. After the reinstall, ypserv and a couple of rpc gobbled up about<br>
90% of the CPU - split around 15-20% user and the rest system.  Is<br>
this a known problem?  I `fixed' it by removing<br>
/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S??ypserv, so I'm more interested in this in the<br>
longer term.<br>
<p>
3. I use `aboot' to boot the system from the SRM console.  It appears<br>
that both the `fdisk partition table' and `bsd compatible disk label'<br>
must be present for this to work.  It also requires some aboot-hacking<br>
to clean up the boot on sdb, because aboot only finds fd0, sda, and<br>
scd.  Is anyone maintaining `aboot' [grep /usr/src/linux/MAINTAINERS<br>
yields nothing]?<br>
<p>
System: Alphastation 255 - two scsi disks - DEC UNIX on sda, RH 4.2 on<br>
sdb.  Uses SRM console to boot.<br>
<p>
4. The discussion of `speculative execution' was interesting but<br>
vague.  I haven't tried to track architecture anywhere near closely<br>
for over 10 years now, so I'm kind of out of touch.  I kind of<br>
wandered away during fairly early, but successful RISC development and<br>
very early parallelism.  Anyway, microprogrammed cpu's on larger<br>
systems have had parallel evaluation of jump targets for over 20<br>
years, so that is nothing new - except possibly driving down into<br>
smaller CPU's.<br>
<p>
I guess my question is more: What does Digital mean by `speculative<br>
execution'? and Is there a standard definition of `speculative<br>
execution' which makes a distinction between precomputing jump targets<br>
or evaluating all possible jump targets in parallel?  [I thought<br>
precomputing jump targets was pretty much standard in RISC processors<br>
from way back and should be pretty much standard in everything now -<br>
given that everything has at least some pipelining].<br>
<p>
5. Is there any way to capture the stuff dumped to the screen when the<br>
system panics other than by `writing it down'?  And, are there any<br>
other magic keys besides `shift scroll lock'?<br>
<p>
thanks, in adv.<br>
