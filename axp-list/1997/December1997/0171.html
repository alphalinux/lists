Hugo (et. al.),<br>
<p>
I sent this today to the Vice President in charge of our Unix group.  We will<br>
see what happens.  I believe this proposal would cover your needs.<br>
<p>
BTW, for those of you who have seen and appreciated my calm, cool messages<br>
on this list (some of which I have to take several days to write) you can<br>
now see how I talk to Vice Presidents.  THIS is why they call me "maddog".<br>
<p>
I would appreciate it, by the way, if this were *not* re-posted.<br>

Tim,<br>
<p>
I have suggested the idea of a "non-commercial" Digital Unix license to<br>
various parts of product management and to Dave Pushee several times, and<br>
the answer always comes back "gee, kind of an interesting concept", but then<br>
if falls through the cracks and nothing ever comes of it.<br>
<p>
Then OpenVMS creates one, and offers it at the last DECUS.  AUGHHHHHHHHH!!!<br>
<p>
This is #$@%^$#@&amp;* stupid.  *Unix* is supposed to be the "Open" system.  *Unix*<br>
is supposed to be the OS used in schools, by students, etc.<br>
<p>
Time after time I have had Alpha Linux people come to me and say:<br>
<p>
	"Gee, I bought the Alpha, and it is cool with Linux on it,<br>
	 but can I get Digital Unix to put on it too?  I would like<br>
	 to try it out."<br>
<p>
Then I tell them they have to pay as much as a motorcycle to get the<br>
license.......and another motorcycle to get the distribution!!<br>
<p>
The Alpha Linux people that HAVE tried Digital Unix (and can afford it) often<br>
switch to DU because of the application availability, or because they<br>
recognize that it is a freaking fine operating system (e.g. the Mindspring<br>
letter).  But they have to *try* it first, and the $1900. entry point ($1200.<br>
for the license and $700. for the distribution) is enough to deter that.<br>
<p>
Sun has a "student license".  SCO has one.  Now OpenVMS has one.<br>
<p>
No, CSLG does not cover this.  It is too hard to apply for, does not cover<br>
clones, does not cover student machines, does not cover hobbyists.<br>
<p>
I would like to see a "one-time" license, associated with an inexpensive<br>
distribution.  You buy the CD-ROM and you get the right to run Digital Unix<br>
on one machine.  The cost of the package:<br>
<p>
	o Installation Manual<br>
	o CD-ROM set (BASE CD and Documentation CD)<br>
	o Two-user PAK<br>
<p>
would also cover the royalties that are due to our royalty stream.  I would<br>
like to see the entire package under $100.<br>
<p>
It would have no warranty, nor could you buy service for it.  It would be "as<br>
is".  Only promoted and orderable through the web (low cost of sales).<br>
<p>
Or, let's take a look at what OpenVMS has done and mimic that.<br>
<p>
For heaven's sake, lets *DO* something.<br>
