Maurice, <br>
<p>
Before we have too much confusion on the list, let's make<br>
clear that the post you quote below is NOT by Terry, who had<br>
the run-in with Parasoft, but by myself.  I think Terry's<br>
post is a model of restraint and decorum, and I confess that<br>
mine is not.  When it comes to situations such as Terry<br>
described, I don't do decorum.  I think Parasoft's conduct<br>
in this case is absolutely inexcusable, and while I'll mince<br>
words here on the list, I certainly wouldn't if I had<br>
Parasoft on the phone.  <br>
<p>
For a company rep to cold-call someone and *reprimand* him<br>
for a posting to the net is the height of bad manners, not<br>
to say idiocy.  But to call three times?  Monumentally<br>
stupid. Any employee of mine who did that would be looking<br>
for a job in one big f*cking hurry.<br>
<p>
Then again, I *AM* a hothead, Maurice, and saner people than<br>
I might react differently.  &lt;shrug&gt; All a matter of style, I<br>
guess, and if Parasoft and I, or you and I, don't agree on<br>
this one, well, so be it.  <br>
<p>

<i>&gt; Before we go and hang these folks let's think this through for a second, OK?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is a company (Parasoft) that heard that someone had tried their FREE</i><br>
<i>&gt; downloadable evaluation software, and upon discovering that the user had</i><br>
<i>&gt; some problems spent the time, effort and costs to contact the individual</i><br>
<i>&gt; and try and help them in getting better results. The person who posted</i><br>
<i>&gt; about this stated that there were some improvements, although not enough to</i><br>
<i>&gt; satisfy him. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; While it might have been bad timing and perhaps they didn't use perfect</i><br>
<i>&gt; etiquette, I can only conclude that they certainly are going the extra</i><br>
<i>&gt; distance in trying to satisfy their (potential) customers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I can only wish that a few other companies would be this concerned with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; needs of users and devote this kind of effort in trying to help...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Cheers,</i><br>
