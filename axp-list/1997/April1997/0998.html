<i>&gt;Claus Denk replied to Thomas Schneider with:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Hello,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; we are planning to buy an aplha for computational fluid mechanics.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Since our programs are written in fortran, we need to know how the g77</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; works on an alpha (reliability, performance etc ..). Is there anybody</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; who has experiences ?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The first version of g77 that supports alpha is 0.5.20 and it</i><br>
<i>&gt;does not compile out of the box on elf systems (although there</i><br>
<i>&gt;is a workaraound). I think 0.5.21 should fix that.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Performance depends a lot on the code that you have in mind, can't</i><br>
<i>&gt;tell about fluid mechanics. You will find codes that perform quite</i><br>
<i>&gt;well with g77 and others that run 2-3 times faster compiled with</i><br>
<i>&gt;a digital f77 compiler. So if you really need this machine for</i><br>
<i>&gt;production runs NOW, either:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;i) get it with DU and f77 (if you can afford)</i><br>
<i>&gt;ii) try the NDP commercial compiler for alpha-linux and tell me</i><br>
<i>&gt;how it performs ! (I posted a question about this compiler on</i><br>
<i>&gt;the comp.lang.fortran group and no one replied - anyone on this</i><br>
<i>&gt;list ?)</i><br>
<p>
The only good fortran compiler for the Alpha is the DEC f77/f90 compiler that  <br>
runs under OSF.  These compilers produce by far the best, fastest code and have  <br>
fast compile times (I mention this for a reason, wait...).  From my optimized  <br>
codes I can get 100-150 MFLOPS on a 300mhz 21164 Microway Screamer processor.   <br>
If you are doing stuff that can take advantage of the DEC DXML (tuned LAPACK  <br>
routines) you will be amazed at the speed that you can get for matrix  <br>
operations (I get 350 MFLOPS on LU decomps and 400+ MFLOPS on matrix  <br>
multiplies).   <br>
<p>
<p>
The fortran situation under Linux/Alpha is pretty bleak, that is why I run DEC  <br>
OSF and the DEC f77/f90 for my work.  If you use f2c/gcc you can expect to get  <br>
about 40 MFLOPS out of a LINPACK benchmark (that runs at 140 MFLOPS on DEC  <br>
f77!).  A bit faster with DEC cc. G77 is currently not yet stable under  <br>
Linux/Alpha although you can make it run and it may well be somewhat faster.    <br>
<p>
<p>
Microway is selling an Alpha version of their NDP f77 compiler but that  <br>
compiler currently only produces 32 bit code (internally it is a 32 bit  <br>
compiler).  It uses its own special libc in addition to the fortran libs and  <br>
cannot, in general, be linked with 64 bit compiled C code (native AXP  <br>
pointers,longs,etc).  Microway has had to patch the Linux kernel and loader to  <br>
run the NDP 32 bit executables.  The two versions of the NDP compiler that I  <br>
have briefly used max out performance-wise at about 70-80 MFLOPS in a LINPACK  <br>
benchmark.  Note that this is what I get when I use it, Steve Fried at Microway  <br>
claims somewhat more speed.  The problem with the NDP compiler is their  <br>
optimizer/scheduler which takes so long to optimize anything that you really  <br>
can't use it for serious work.  It takes over 10 minutes for the NDP compiler  <br>
running on the 300mhz Alpha to optimize a 20 line SAXPY routine!  And the  <br>
results are never as good as the DEC compiler that does it in about 2 seconds,  <br>
although Steve Fried (Microway) now maintains that his NDP optimized DAXPY is  <br>
as fast as that from DEC f77.  The practical upshot of the slow optimization is  <br>
that I don't even try to optimize anything complex with the NDP compiler.  If  <br>
you did a complete profiling and extracted only the key routines for  <br>
optimization you might get better results.<br>
<p>
The people at Microway are in the process of rewriting their compiler for 64  <br>
bit internals to get around all the interface issues with gcc code.  I don't  <br>
know when that process will be finished and a new version will be available.<br>
<p>
Terri Klaila at Microway (508)-746-7341 is quite up front and frank about this  <br>
and has been quite helpful.  She normally recommends that people who need speed  <br>
run DEC OSF to use the DEC f77/f90 compiler, rather than Linux - for the moment  <br>
at least.  <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Any other comments from AXP'ers on the NDP compiler?<br>
