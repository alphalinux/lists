pete, terry (and children), others<br>
<p>
(A)<br>
I've finally managed to run the exactly same command on both Intel and Alpha:<br>
<p>
time povray +a0.3 +w640 +h480 -ikaleid5.pov +d +SP32<br>
(640x480 because 800x600 crashes, +d +SP32 to be able to see something<br>
(adds only a few seconds))<br>
<p>
results:<br>
<p>
			   21164	 Pentium<br>
			 366 MHz	  90 MHz<br>
time for parse	 0:00:03	 0:00:10<br>
time for trace	 4:46:53	16:08:45<br>
<p>
user			17013.03	57423.00<br>
system		    4.99	   11.99<br>
elapsed		 4:46:56	16:08:15<br>
CPU			     98%	     24%<br>
<p>
So the main conclusion is that "time" is broken on Intel: my calculator<br>
makes that 99%.<br>
<p>
The second conclusion is that the Alpha at 366 is 3.4 times as fast as the<br>
Pent at 90. This is not as good as I hoped (hence Subject:). I think a<br>
better compiler should improve this. Larger cache might also be useful<br>
(fixed at 1M on PC164), and maybe memory bandwith. Please feel free to<br>
verify this by running the same test (a) with DU-compiled povray, (b) on an<br>
EB164, or one of those newer boxes, with more cache, or (c) on a PC164 with<br>
8 SIMMs installed.<br>
<p>
(B)<br>
Some other experiments: editing the .pov file to find out where that time<br>
is being spent:<br>
removing the fancy parameters on some of the light sources --&gt; much, much<br>
faster<br>
turning them off altogether --&gt; even better<br>
replacing the BITMAPnn textures with WOOD1 --&gt; pretty too (and faster)<br>
All of those together --&gt; 1:13 (no, not 1h13m: 1m13s. Would you believe it?)<br>
For these variations the speedfactor between Alpha and Pentium varies<br>
between 3.6 and 4.4.<br>
<p>
I guess , to meet her deadline, your friend should have rendered the<br>
picture without the extra params on the lightsources. I imagine pretty much<br>
the same effect could have been achieved by simply adjusting the<br>
RGB-values. This variation took 16:14 on the Alpha, 58:23 on Pentium, and<br>
would certainly have completed within a couple of hours on your 486.<br>
<p>
(C)<br>
I started out doing those tests on my X-desktop, with top running in an<br>
xterm. Then I realized that top effects the povray in two ways. It takes<br>
away CPU time, so it will take longer. OK. This is easily accounted for. No<br>
harm done. But.., on top of that, every time after top has run, and talked<br>
to xterm, which has talked to the X-server, and then povray gets back to<br>
the CPU, and finds (part of) it's cache flushed, so for a while it will run<br>
slower than it could have.<br>
I tested this by running one rendering with top, without top, without some<br>
other things, and finally from single user mode. There's a difference of<br>
about 2% in the CPU-time taken by povray (as reported by time). So this is<br>
not too important after all. I'm just telling you to show how busy i've<br>
been, and maybe to show how easy it is, in performance work, to get<br>
involved in minor details and lose track of the main issues.<br>
<p>
(D)<br>
Avoiding the povray 3.01 bug by running the Intel version from the EM86<br>
environment (I think Pieter came up with this..?) In my opinion you<br>
wouldn't run into the bug, but we'll never be certain because I doubt<br>
anyone will have the patience to run this tests. Those CPU intensive<br>
programs usually show very bad performance, even under the best of emulators.<br>
<p>
(E)<br>
Now I'll render the picture one more time, at a very high resolution, just<br>
to look at it. And that will have been the last time.<br>
