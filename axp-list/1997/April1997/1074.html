I had responded earlier to a question asking if someone on this list had any  <br>
experience with the Microway NDP f77 compiler.  The intent was to at least put  <br>
some kind of user feedback on that compiler into the Linux/Alpha record.  <br>
<p>
<p>
The discussion got sidetracked on fortran/f2c/g77/DEC f77 religious issues and  <br>
later that same day Henry chih-hsiang Yao asked if anybody had tested the  <br>
Microway NDP fortune compiler(??).  I give up...  <br>
<p>
<p>
Just so the non-contentious information is available here is what I know about  <br>
the Microway NDP f77 compiler...<br>
<p>
<p>
Microway is selling an Alpha version of their NDP f77 compiler for Linux. I  <br>
bought that from them and have installed and tested two compiler versions over  <br>
the past year.   Both of these were ECOFF compilers and both required patched  <br>
Linux kernels to run NDP executables.  I understand from Microway that the  <br>
compiler is being updated to ELF although I have not seen an ELF version yet.<br>
<p>
The NDP compiler is internally a 32 bit compiler and emits 32 bit code.  Hence  <br>
the patch to the kernel to run the NDP executables in "low memory".  The NDP  <br>
compiler comes with a somewhat un-Unix like compiler driver that, among other  <br>
things, does not understand the -L flag for library paths, instead you have to  <br>
set an environment variable to point to the libraries, although this does not  <br>
completely work either.  I understand that the driver is being updated,  <br>
although these peculiarities indicate that this product began (somewhere down  <br>
the road) as a DOS compiler.  <br>
<p>
<p>
The compiler comes with a very complete run time library including VAX  <br>
extensions and most of the normal Unix f77 extensions.  It supports records but  <br>
not Cray pointers.  The compiler also requires its own libc which, I suppose,  <br>
is needed to support the 32 bit compiler run time.  This presents a problem  <br>
immediately to those (like me) who wish to mix fortran and C code.  The NDP  <br>
libc uses the same namespace as the GNU libc for Linux and is not compatible.   <br>
If you try to link with the X libraries (for example) you run into a brick  <br>
wall, the NDP objects cannot be linked to the native system libraries which use  <br>
64-bit pointers. <br>
<p>
<p>
The upshot of this is that the NDP compiler, in its current state, is  <br>
essentially a stand-alone fortran environment, suitable for compiling and  <br>
running bare fortran codes in a terminal window. <br>
<p>
<p>
In terms of performance I have only compiled a handful of codes and a few  <br>
benchmarks with this compiler as most of my programs do some kind of X graphics  <br>
or link with C routines somewhere along the line. The NDP optimized LINPACK  <br>
(single precision, dimensioned to 400/401) runs at about 70-80 MFLOPS on my  <br>
Screamer 21164 300mhz.  In comparison the f2c/gcc combo gives about 40 MFLOPS  <br>
on this machine and the best DEC f77 executable runs at 140 MFLOPS.<br>
<p>
One of the difficulties of using this compiler concerns the very long compile  <br>
times when you crank up the optimization.  The NDP compiler has a set of normal  <br>
optimizations (common subexpression, loop invariant removal, etc) in a compiler  <br>
phase they call "ABE" and a second optimization phase they call "GVS"  which  <br>
does vectorization and scheduling.  To get beyond about 60 MFLOPS on the  <br>
LINPACK benchmark you need to invoke the GVS phase and here the compile time  <br>
really begins to get long.  It helps to profile the code and edit out the  <br>
routines which really need optimization, if you naively just turn on the GVS  <br>
optimizer to the whole LINPACK program you might as just go to bed and let it  <br>
run all night!   If you only optimize SDOT, SAXPY and SSCAL you can do a bit  <br>
better (10 minutes or more) but it still takes a long time.  Steve Fried at  <br>
Microway has apparently done a very complete optimization of the DAXPY routine  <br>
(his favorite subject for compiler tuning adventures) and gotten similar speeds  <br>
to that from the DEC compiler.  <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;From a practical point of view the compile times are too long with any higher  </i><br>
level of optimization (with vectorization and scheduling) so that I could not  <br>
use this compiler to fully optimize any "real" code.  I compiled a huge NASA  <br>
CFD code with this compiler at a modest optimization level and it took over 4  <br>
hours to compile what took 15 minutes with DEC fortran at full optimization.  I  <br>
did not run this as a benchmark due to the problems of linking with the system  <br>
libs because the NASA code used a few C routines for dynamic memory management.   <br>
If I were more industrious I could have modified the NASA code to use the NDP  <br>
f77 library routines for dynamic memory.<br>
<p>
Microway is in the process of rewriting their compiler for 64-bit internals to  <br>
facilitate using the NDP compiler with the native gcc compiled libraries.  I  <br>
don't know when that will be available.<br>

The contact at Microway is Terri Klaila (508)-746-7341 who has been quite  <br>
helpful.<br>
