Hello;<br>
<p>
On last Saturday I posted a message describing my experience with Insure++<br>
under Linux/Intel. I had downloaded the evaluation copy from the Parasoft<br>
ftp site.<br>
<p>
Today I had someone from Parasoft telephoned and IMHO begin to chew me out<br>
for posting that message. He mentioned that someone from this mailing list<br>
'forwarded' him a copy. I do not understand why someone on this list felt<br>
it necessary to forward that mail to Parasoft. I do not appreciate having<br>
any vendor telephone me three times in one day, implying that I do not know<br>
what I am doing with Insure++. I did speak with Parasoft's tech support<br>
and explained why I felt it was slow, and in the case I was evaluating<br>
unacceptably slow. I went along with his suggestions and the while the<br>
program did have somewhat better performance the increase was nothing<br>
great.<br>
<p>
I do stand by what I stated in the Saturday posting that Insure++ is <br>
slow, and after spending the Easter weekend working with it, I find it<br>
unacceptably slow. <br>
<p>
Given Parasoft's actions today in telephoning me at home after explaining<br>
to the first caller that I have a broken shoulder and had been up all night<br>
from pain, I see no reason to have any further dealings with this Company.<br>
<p>
This is my opinion only, your mileage may vary. ;-)<br>
<p>
I would ask that the person who felt that he has to forward my original<br>
posting to Parasoft, please contact me via private e-mail and explain yourself.<br>
What happen to the common courtesy of asking me first?<br>
<p>
I have CC'ed Parasoft a copy of this message already so there is no need<br>
to forward them another.<br>
