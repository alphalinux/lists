Yesterday Michael Callahan and I asked for help installing Red Hat 4.1<br>
onto a floppy-disk-less AlphaStation 255.  Thanks to everyone who wrote.<br>
<p>
Since then, we've upgraded the SRM console to v6.4 (using bootp/tftp to<br>
pick up the new flash image over the net).  After that, we could use the<br>
aboot image on the CD to boot a kernel, but then we couldn't figure out<br>
how to get that kernel to read a ramdisk image off the CD-ROM (is it<br>
possible?).<br>
<p>
At this point, we gave in and cannibalized a PC's floppy drive.  By<br>
loading ramdisk.img onto a floppy, we could now get into the install<br>
program.<br>
<p>
In fact, we could install a Red Hat image onto the disk that boots<br>
correctly, _provided_ you boot it by going via aboot on the CD: that is,<br>
   SRM&gt; boot dka400 -fl i<br>
   ...<br>
   aboot&gt; kernels/avanti-s.gz root=/dev/sda1<br>
   [Linux kernel from CD boots, mounts /dev/sda1 as root]<br>
<p>
Now, we'd obviously like the hard disk to boot itself.<br>
<p>
[[Aside: where does it explain the difference between avanti.gz and<br>
avanti-s.gz?]]<br>
<p>
As far as we can tell, the approved way of doing this is to use aboot (is<br>
it just us, or is the Alpha documentation very confusing on the question<br>
of how to set up a bootable hard disk?).  So, we install the aboot RPM and<br>
do<br>
   swriteboot /dev/sda /boot/bootlx<br>
(Actually, this comes after reinstalling the whole system from scratch in<br>
order to leave room for the aboot boot loader at the front of the disk...<br>
it would be awfully nice if the documentation would mention this at some<br>
point _before_ the point where, having installed your machine, you<br>
discover that aboot is what you apparently need to make it reboot<br>
properly.)<br>
<p>
In any case, running swriteboot now appears to have trashed the partition<br>
table.  This is judging from running fdisk -l just before the swriteboot<br>
(which looked fine) and comparing it to fdisk -l just after the swriteboot<br>
(gibberish).<br>
<p>
We're now going to try doing this whole thing over again once more, using<br>
a BSD-style disklabel.<br>
<p>
Can anyone who has a working AlphaStation 255 with SRM console please<br>
explain how they have set their machine up, especially including how they<br>
did it so that it would boot straight off the hard disk into Linux?<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
Peter and Michael<br>
