I've read the "eth0 hangs on boot" comments over the last couple of<br>
months, it effected me on the universities UDB, now that I have my <br>
own I have to figure this out.<br>
<p>
People that have this problem...<br>
- Don't use the Tulip driver, use the DE4X5...  As I found out<br>
  when all of the physical science buildings subnet went berzerk.<br>
- Use an up to date kernel (2.0.29)<br>
- Use RH4.1 (you don't have to, but why not?  It has easy TGA with XFree3.2)<br>
<p>
In addition, I don't have a /etc/nsswitch.conf to delete and putting<br>
"sleep 10s" didn't help in /etc/rc.d/init.d/network.  I put it in<br>
the for loop just after the ifup statement, don't know if that was<br>
right.  I looked in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup...  It was<br>
a little bit more complicated than I was hoping for, it would take<br>
someone with more time and knowledge to sort it all out.<br>
<p>
OK...  Here is were I made my personal breakthrough.  I've found that<br>
one of the reasons it locks is that its doing something with the <br>
gateway (GATEWAY= in /etc/sysconfig/network).  If the gateway happens<br>
to be unreachable (in my case its an Intel/Linux box doing IP Masq)<br>
or turned off, then the boot sequence hangs for ~10 minutes.  Unless,<br>
I can suddenly reach my gateway again, then it continues in 30sec or so.<br>
THE FIX: have GATEWAY= (nothing)...  It boots fine then (for me atleast),<br>
and then do something like this further in the boot sequence:<br>
<p>
	route add (UDB IP) gw (GW IP) dev eth0<br>
<p>
It works fine now, I get what I want...  The ability to boot, if my<br>
gateway is down.  It is gross and messy though.  A fix instead of<br>
a work around would be helpful.<br>
<p>
I'm sure some of these things are obvious to most of the audience,<br>
but it could save a newbie's life.<br>
