Yes, you can tell themt hat, but bear in mind that part of what you are<br>
paying for when you buy the license is Digital support for UNIX. If you lie<br>
about the machine, you still are going to be in an unsupported situation.<br>
This would mean that in some senses you are paying too much. As for the<br>
AXPpxi33 going unsupported, not for at least 2 years. Digital guarantees<br>
this. The reason that the UDB is currently unsupported is that it _NEVER_<br>
was supported for UNIX.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I've been continuing to mail various distributors regarding finding a copy</i><br>
<i>&gt;of DEC Unix/OSF1, and I've still had no luck. As far as running Linux on</i><br>
<i>&gt;my box, it's *very* stable, however getting most software to compile</i><br>
<i>&gt;without serious code tweaking is not possible.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If you happen to have an older copy of OSF1 that you'd like to get rid of,</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'd happily take it off your hands. Hell, if you've got access to a CD-R,</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'd send you blank CD's and some cash. heh... Do you have any idea how</i><br>
<i>&gt;much a license is from a legitimate distributor? If it's anywhere near</i><br>
<i>&gt;Solaris ($200-300 for the full base package, unlimited use), it would</i><br>
<i>&gt;definitely be worth investing in. If it's anywhere near NeXTstep ($5000</i><br>
<i>&gt;for the full package) it's a bit out of my league. Let me know if you have</i><br>
<i>&gt;any suggestions or ideas. </i><br>
<p>
First of all, the ownership of media does not constitute a license for<br>
Digital UNIX. Licenses are pieces of paper which are "attached" legally to<br>
a CPU. They contain the information which you use to "install" the license<br>
on the machine. I will gladly sell you a set of our media which we no<br>
longer use. In doing so, I would be selling it as used, and as a<br>
"replacement".<br>
<p>
However, using it without a license won't help you much. First, it's<br>
illegal. Secondly, once you do the software install you can log in as root,<br>
and do only limited things. You have to install the license key using the<br>
license manager before you can do anything useful. Only then do you get a<br>
full operational OS.<br>
<p>
Hope this clears things up a bit for you.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, if you want a license for an AXPpci33, we can sell you<br>
one, along with a motherboard and 233MHz CPU for $ 1015 U.S. This will give<br>
you a legitimate license, CPU, and a motherboard. <br>
 Better yet, you can buy a complete computer, with legal Digital UNIX,<br>
based around an AXPpci33 266MHz, for as little as $1990.<br>
 This would include a 1.2GB Quantum hard drive, 32MB of RAM, 256K cache, a<br>
desktop case, 266MHz CPU, floppy, 12x CD-ROM, 2MB S3 video, mouse,<br>
keyboard, 270W power supply, ethernet card, and full warranty and support.<br>
This price includes a full 2 user Digital UNIX license, and media on CD for<br>
UNIX 4.0. You can then sell the UDB, or better yet use it as an X terminal<br>
if you have another user in your location. As the UNIX license is a 2 user<br>
one, this is perfectly legal and legitimate.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
