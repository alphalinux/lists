I've been watching this list for quite a while, to see if this is a<br>
problem anyone else is having - and I haven't seen anything, so I figured<br>
I'd have a go at asking about this....<br>
<p>
I've been working with Linux for a few years, so building new kernels for<br>
whatever reason (upgrade, new hardware) usually doesn't seem like such a<br>
hard thing, but this has me baffled. <br>
<p>
I'm working with a RedHat 4.1 install (from RedHat's CD) with the errata<br>
RPM's applied - the system is a DEC UDB(Multia/Noname) 166, 64MB RAM,<br>
340MB internal SCSI disk (swap) and 2.15 GB IBM SCSI disk (mounted in<br>
external case with SCSI CDROM and HP 4000s SCSI tape). I was looking to<br>
put the tape drive into service, and I don't think the kernel by default<br>
has that support compiled in. <br>
<p>
Here's where it gets interesting - I go through the normal process of<br>
building a new kernel (make config, make dep, make clean) and hit the<br>
first snag. I've done this a bunch on PC's - the next command for an i386<br>
kernel would be a "make zImage" - but on the DEC, I figured that the<br>
kernel was some how differently compressed by gzip (hence vmlinux.gz), so<br>
I figured I'd go with the obvious, and simply typed "make". <br>
<p>
The alpha chugged through a *lot* of code, and finished up with a kernel<br>
that was *7.7MB*. I knew that alpha code was going to be somewhat bigger,<br>
but that seemed a bit excessive - even after a "gzip -9". <br>
<p>
But, I figured, what the heck - give it a try.<br>
<p>
I found that *this* alpha won't boot a kernel that size. Very unhappy.<br>
<p>
Back to the drawing board. <br>
<p>
I have gone through this a few more times, and at this point I'm sure that<br>
I'm simply not looking in the right place for the answer - is this an<br>
errata that just isn't covered anymore (since the kernel version I'm<br>
working with [2.0.27] isn't the newest) or is this just *me*? <br>
<p>
Thanks for reading this - and thanks *very much* for any answers!<br>
<p>
