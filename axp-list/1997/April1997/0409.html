If you like to use something like srand48(time(0)) to initialize<br>
random number generation, you may not like the behavior you get under<br>
the current glibc.  E.g., try the following program and you'll see<br>
what I mean.<br>
<p>
<pre>
---
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
<p>
int
main (int argc, char **argv)
{
  int i, j;
<p>
  for (j = 0; j &lt; 5; ++j)
    {
      srand48 (j);
      for (i = 0; i &lt; 5; ++i) printf ("%8.6f ", drand48());
      printf("\n");
    }
  return 0;
}
<pre>
---
<p>
This "bug" has been fixed by Uli for glibc-2.03 but in the meantime,
you may want to apply the appended patch.  For your convenience, I
also appended a uuencoded version of the fixed erand48() object file.
Erik tells me that the next Red Hat Linux/Alpha release will have this
fix as well.
