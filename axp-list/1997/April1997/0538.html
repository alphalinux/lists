<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I to was having the same problems that other people on the list was</i><br>
<i>&gt; having. I tired all the hints that people gave and none of them seemed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; work for me.</i><br>
<p>
Random patching in a random order what not a list of hints, as far as<br>
I recall.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1. I grabed linux-2.0.30.tar.gz from ftp.cs.helsinki.fi and applied the</i><br>
<i>&gt; axp diff from 2.0.21.</i><br>
<p>
You had to end up with rejects.  It means, in particular, that one<br>
header was patched (include/linux/fs.h), but a corresponding patches<br>
to a code were rejected.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; When I tried compiling it I got the same error that</i><br>
<i>&gt; other people got. </i><br>
<p>
This is not surprising if you did not resolve collisions "by hand".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2. Next, using the same linux-2.0.30.tar.gz, I applied then axp diff from</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2.0.21, and then applied a patch that someone on the list sent out.</i><br>
<p>
That "someone" probably would be me.  These patches were clearly<br>
described as NOT for that situation.  You were bound to get rejects<br>
once again.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It puked the compile at the same spot. </i><br>
<p>
See above.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 4. I don't know why I thought this might work, but here's what I tried</i><br>
<i>&gt; next. I had the linux-2.0.28.tar.gz. I untarted that, applied the patch to</i><br>
<i>&gt; bring it up to linux 2.0.29.  Then I applied the axp diff patch.</i><br>
<p>
There were no rejects this time, as the stuff which collides was<br>
modified between 2.0.29 and 2.0.30<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Then I applied the patch to 2.0.30,</i><br>
<p>
You got rejects once again.  Posted patches were exactly for this<br>
situation (current 2.0.29-axp, patched to 2.0.30 and some leftovers had<br>
to be fixed).  BTW - it is not hard to see from a posted patch contents<br>
how modified code should look like if you had chosen a route like in<br>
your attempt 1.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This time it worked! </i><br>
<p>
It works without resolving remaining conflicts because, as luck has it,<br>
what needs to be done is a removal of few variables which are not used<br>
anymore in a patched code of block_dev.c and changes to a code miracuosly<br>
survived.  So, if you left things alone, you got a few "dead variables"<br>
in a kernel code and maybe some warnings from a compiler.  Other time,<br>
when a "real code" will be involved, your luck may not hold.<br>
<p>
Moral: random trials are not a substitute for paying attention to<br>
'patch' warnings and error messages (and acting on a received<br>
information).<br>
