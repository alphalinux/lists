I'm working on GNU Fortran (g77) version 0.5.21, which will fix<br>
a bunch of bugs in 0.5.20.<br>
<p>
One thing I've heard on this mailing list is that g77-0.5.20<br>
doesn't compile cleanly "out of the box", so to speak, on<br>
Linux/Alpha/ELF systems.<br>
<p>
I use an ancient Linux/Alpha/ECOFF system (still), and that<br>
will probably change (it was supposed to last week, not sure<br>
what's going on, but that's another story).  I've been<br>
intending to put off alpha-testing 0.5.21 until after<br>
my current Alpha system is exchanged for one that has newer<br>
system software (presumably ELF-based).  But it is not<br>
clear that I'll personally be running ELF here when<br>
doing putting 0.5.21 through alpha testing prior to public<br>
release.<br>
<p>
In any case, it could be helpful to have, among the g77 alpha<br>
testers, one or two people who are willing to alpha-test<br>
g77 specifically to make sure it builds cleanly on canonical,<br>
contemporary Linux/Alpha systems (and maybe old ones as well),<br>
such as RedHat, Craftworks, whatever.<br>
<p>
Send me (&lt;<a href="mailto:burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu">burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu</a>&gt;) email asking about becoming<br>
an alpha testers if you're interested in doing this.  (Though<br>
this e-mail is intended to rope in Linux/Alpha users, g77<br>
alpha testing is still open to all sorts of people willing<br>
to help out during the alpha-test phase of development.)<br>
<p>
If you have some patches or at least some info on what needs<br>
to change in g77 to support Linux/Alpha/ELF better, please<br>
at least send those along to &lt;<a href="mailto:fortran@gnu.ai.mit.edu">fortran@gnu.ai.mit.edu</a>&gt;.  Even<br>
if you can't become an alpha tester, maybe others will, who<br>
will be able to test out the g77 I produce by using the<br>
patches/info you provide!<br>
<p>
(Alpha testing is still done on every single g77 release<br>
_before_ it goes to the public as a "beta" release.  While<br>
that has not yet led to the perfect beta, I'm pretty sure<br>
there's been no perfect alpha release either, so without<br>
the g77 alpha testers, public releases wouldn't even be as<br>
good as they have been!)<br>
<p>
        tq vm, (burley)<br>
