Before we go and hang these folks let's think this through for a second, OK?<br>
<p>
This is a company (Parasoft) that heard that someone had tried their FREE<br>
downloadable evaluation software, and upon discovering that the user had<br>
some problems spent the time, effort and costs to contact the individual<br>
and try and help them in getting better results. The person who posted<br>
about this stated that there were some improvements, although not enough to<br>
satisfy him. <br>
<p>
While it might have been bad timing and perhaps they didn't use perfect<br>
etiquette, I can only conclude that they certainly are going the extra<br>
distance in trying to satisfy their (potential) customers.<br>
<p>
I can only wish that a few other companies would be this concerned with the<br>
needs of users and devote this kind of effort in trying to help...<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
