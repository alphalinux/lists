<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Before we go and hang these folks let's think this through for a second, OK?</i><br>
<p>
I did think about it, as was being polite in all previous posts.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is a company (Parasoft) that heard that someone had tried their FREE</i><br>
<i>&gt; downloadable evaluation software, and upon discovering that the user had</i><br>
<i>&gt; some problems spent the time, effort and costs to contact the individual</i><br>
<i>&gt; and try and help them in getting better results. The person who posted</i><br>
<i>&gt; about this stated that there were some improvements, although not enough to</i><br>
<i>&gt; satisfy him. </i><br>
<p>
I was being polite in my previous postings concerning Parasoft. I did not go<br>
into previous conversations with the salesperson. In this posting I will be<br>
very blunt.<br>
<p>
When I first contacted Parasoft, I ask if they had a version for Linux/Alpha<br>
I was sent e-mail telling me to download the version for SunOS 4. I have that<br>
e-mail if anyone wants a copy. As an alternative I downloaded the Linux/Intel<br>
version. <br>
<p>
Yesterday in the telephone calls from Parasoft, the second caller was rude,<br>
and very personal in his attacks. There was no interest in helping the<br>
possible client, he was interested in only one thing, NO NEGATIVE POSTS,<br>
to the net. Based on his attitude alone I would not deal with Parasoft.<br>
<p>
The evaluation software requires a password, and license from Parasoft to<br>
run, and has an expiration date. I downloaded the software late Friday, and<br>
started it running on Friday evening. My original posting was made on Saturday.<br>
I was up all day Easter Sunday, and most of yesterday. I did explain this<br>
to the first caller, and I did state that I was going to try and get some rest.<br>
<p>
The last call from Parasoft came late in the day, and I told that caller<br>
that even if I started a new evaluation that the program would not finish before<br>
Insure++ expired. (April 1, 1997). He did not extend the expiration date.<br>
<p>
I was able to evaluate Insure++ for basically 3-4 days.<br>
<p>
The evaluation still stands, Insure++ itself is unacceptably slow.<br>
The improvements in speed only came after compiling all source files<br>
except one with gcc, and that one with insight. The application was<br>
linked with insight. Even with only one source file being "analyzed"<br>
the speed improvement was only minor.<br>
<p>
Parasoft as a company is rude, and interested only in "NO NEGATIVE" postings<br>
to the net.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; While it might have been bad timing and perhaps they didn't use perfect</i><br>
<i>&gt; etiquette, I can only conclude that they certainly are going the extra</i><br>
<i>&gt; distance in trying to satisfy their (potential) customers.</i><br>
<p>
Again their interest was not in 'satisfying a pontential customer', their<br>
were interested in only stopping "NEGATIVE POSTING".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I can only wish that a few other companies would be this concerned with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; needs of users and devote this kind of effort in trying to help...</i><br>
<p>
Any company who is willing to be polite, and helpful to a potential client<br>
with an evaluation is welcomed, but not Parasoft. Their attitude was not<br>
one of help, but rudeness, accusations, and asking if I bothered to read the<br>
online manuals. I find their attitude insulting.<br>
<p>
Even since the accident where I broke my shoulder, when one of my clients<br>
have telephoned me at home, I have been polite, and either one of the other<br>
consultants handled their concerns in a polite manner, or one of my children<br>
have handled it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Cheers,</i><br>
