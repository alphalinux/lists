   From: Michal Jaegermann &lt;<a href="mailto:michal@ellpspace.math.ualberta.ca">michal@ellpspace.math.ualberta.ca</a>&gt;<br>

<p>
   There is one small problem, though.  I do not know if my headers on<br>
   Alpha are in a sorry state, or this is more general (if you know<br>
   please tell me).  I could not recompile these programs until I did the<br>
   following modification in sources (which do not look right, but were<br>
   necessary):<br>
<p>
I don't know.  I don't have an Alpha yet.  (Anyone have a spare Alpha<br>
they'd be willing to give to me, just let me know.  :-)<br>
<p>
   I also know why I dislike a way of compiling with a help of rpm<br>
   (if somebody knows more reasonable way to create packages I am all<br>
   ears).  If something will go wrong and has to be fixed then rpm<br>
   starts everything from scracth and its first action is to clobber<br>
   your modified sources with an old copy from .tar.gz file. Big sigh!<br>
   Anybody know some way to restart this process in the middle?<br>
<p>
Read the man pages for rpm --short-circuit; it's handy for these sorts<br>
of things.<br>
<p>
My self, I generally cd to /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/&lt;pkg&gt;, and then edit<br>
the sources and compile manually until everything is working.  Then, I<br>
generate a new set of patches, put the patches into the SOURCE directory<br>
(updating the spec file as needed), and then do a full RPM build to make<br>
sure I generated the patches correctly.  (That's how come RPM is done<br>
the way that it's done; it really wants to make sure that before you<br>
actually generate a binary package, it can be generated reliably from<br>
sources such that the source SRPM accurately reflects the actually<br>
generated binary.)<br>
<p>
   Beyond that things seem to be peachy. :-) In particular I just "yanked<br>
   a cord" on Alpha system with a freshly installed new fsck to see if it<br>
   will recover.  It did. :-) "Unaligned access" warnings are gone, as<br>
   far as I can tell, but checks seemed to be on a slow side despite<br>
   Ted's comments in sources which seem to indicate that this should not<br>
   be the case anymore.<br>
<p>
I'd really like to know more about "checks being slow", if you wouldn't<br>
mind investigating this.  There are two things you can do.  The first is<br>
to use "e2fsck -nfvtt /dev/device" to get per-pass timing inforamtion.<br>
This is useful in order to determine which pass is getting slowed down,<br>
and whether the slowdown is due to I/O or CPU overhead.  (Note that with<br>
the new GNU mallocs which use mmap() to allocate memory for large memory<br>
allocation requests, the memory used statistics is generally not<br>
accurate, since that uses sbrk(2) to try to estimate the amount of data<br>
memeory used.)<br>
<p>
The other thing you can do is compile with profiling (assuming that the<br>
speed hit is due to CPU overhead, which is likely the case).<br>
<p>
There's also some standard questions which would help me try to figure<br>
out what's going on.  How big is the filesystem?  What base hardware are<br>
you using?  What sort of special usages (if any) does the filesystem<br>
have?  (i.e., news spool, small numbers of very large files, etc.)<br>
<p>
I've personally tested e2fsprogs 1.09 on the i386 architectures, on disks up<br>
to 1 gigabyte, and the performance roughly comparable with version<br>
1.06.  I've also had someone else test a pre-release version of<br>
e2fsprogs 1.09 on a i386 with a 12 gig news spool, and the performance<br>
was mostly the same.  I do welcome other data points.<br>
