Opportunity is knocking, and this time you are home!<br>
<p>
	You have probably heard of multi-level marketing, or MLM.<br>
MLM is fast becoming the most popular form of direct marketing sales,<br>
and represents the way of the future for business marketing.  MLM<br>
techniques are being taught in the Harvard Business School and both<br>
Stanford Research and The Wall Street Journal have stated that between<br>
50% and 65% of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level<br>
methods by the end of the decade.  This is a multi-billion dollar <br>
industry, and of the 500,000 millionaires in the US, 20% made their<br>
fortune in the last several years in MLM.  Moreover, statistics show <br>
that 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi-level<br>
marketing.<br>
<p>
	The business opportunity presented here will show you how to<br>
use your basic email service at home to get in on the ground level<br>
of the multi-level marketing industry.  Simply follow the steps<br>
presented here, and in the not too distant future you too will be<br>
one of the 45 people who become a millionaire every day!<br>
<p>
	Best regards, and good luck in your future endeavours.<br>
<p>

                         The Internet MLM Plan	<br>
                                   or<br>
                    How To Become Financially Stable<br>
                          In 90 Days Or Less<br>
<p>
	The concept behind multi-level marketing is simple, but very<br>
powerfull.  The majority of sales made are not made directly by you,<br>
but by your customers, who in turn sell your product.  To understand<br>
the potential of MLM methods, lets examine how it works as applied<br>
to the product you will be marketing.<br>
<p>
	You will be marketing four "MLM Reports", numbered one through<br>
four at a cost of $5 each.  The reports discuss MLM issues such as how<br>
to best make use of MLM methods, evaluation of MLM techniques, and<br>
how corporations are making use of MLM.  You will start by marketing<br>
report number one.  Suppose you start small and only sell 20 reports.<br>
In turn, each of these 20 people will then sell report one to, let's<br>
say, 20 more people each, for a total of 20x20=400 reports.  You will<br>
see no revenue from these 400 reports sold, but each of those 400<br>
people will need a copy of report two, which you will provide.<br>
Continuing in this manner, those 400 people will each sell report one<br>
to 20 more people, for a total 400x20=8000 copies of the third report<br>
sold by you.  Finally, those 8000 people will sell to 20 more people,<br>
meaning you will sell 8000x20=160000 copies of report four.  So in<br>
total you will sell 168420 reports, at $5 per report, for a total<br>
revenue of $842100.00!  How does that sound for financial stability?<br>
<p>
	How do you find 20 people to purchase a copy of your report?<br>
By sending a copy of this email message to as many people as possible<br>
you can easilly achieve 20 sales.  Suppose only 1% of the people you<br>
email purchase a report (that means 99 out of 100 people do nothing).<br>
Then you only need to email 2000 people.  As it turns out, purchase<br>
rates of the reports are much higher than 1% and we'll show you how to<br>
easilly obtain over 250000 email addresses!  Imagine you get only a<br>
0.1% purchase rate (999 out of every 1000 people do nothing) but you<br>
sent out 250000 email messages.  Then you could expect 250 sales<br>
of report one.  If we assume each customer then only sells 20 reports,<br>
as we did above, then you can expect to make a total of 2105250<br>
sales which translates to over 10 million dollars!!!  What could you<br>
do with 10 million dollars?<br>
<p>
	Before we actually provide the instructions for this plan,<br>
we'd like to take this opportunity to present some true testimonials<br>
from people who have succeeded and have now retired from the MLM<br>
Internet plan.  While you are reading these testimonials, think <br>
about what you will do when you are a millionaire.<br>

                            "Threw It Away"<br>
<p>
I had received this program before.  I threw it away, but later<br>
wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try.  Of course, I had no idea<br>
who to contact to get a copy, so I had to wait until I was emailed<br>
another copy of the program.  Eleven months passed, then it came.<br>
I DIDN'T throw this one away.  I made $41,000 on the first try."<br>

<p>
                            "No Free Lunch"<br>
<p>
My late father always told me, "remember, Alan, there is no free lunch<br>
in life.  You get out of life what you put into it."  Through trial<br>
and error, and a somewhat slow, frustrating start, I finally figured<br>
it out.  The program works very well, I just had to find the right<br>
target group of people to email.  So far this year I have made over<br>
$63,000 using this program.  I know my Dad would have been very proud<br>
of me.<br>

<p>
<p>
                        "It Was Truly Amazing"<br>
<p>
Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my<br>
mind to participate in this program.  But conservative as I am, I <br>
decided that the initial investment was so little that there was no<br>
way that I could not get enough orders to at least get my money back.<br>
BOY, was I ever surprised when I found my medium sized post office<br>
box crammed with orders!  I will make more money this year then any <br>
ten previous years of my life!<br>

**********************************************************************<br>
<p>
                           A Few Final Remarks<br>
<p>
	We know you will proceed with this plan...it is simply too<br>
good to pass up.  The initial investment is so low (only $20 to <br>
purchase all four reports) that you'd kick yourself if you passed on<br>
this opportunity.  Please read carefully the following instructions<br>
and then sit back and watch the money roll in.<br>
<p>
	Work hard, have fun, and enjoy life.  Good luck.<br>
<p>
**********************************************************************<br>
<p>
                             Instructions<br>
<p>
1. Order all four reports listed by name and number.  Do this by <br>
   ordering the report from each of the four names listed in the next<br>
   section.  For each report, send $5 cash and a self-addressed, <br>
   stamped envelope (business size #10) to the person listed for the<br>
   specific report.  Please make sure to conceal the $5 cash you send.<br>
<p>
   International orders should also include $1 for return postage,<br>
   since you most likely won't be able to purchase the appropriate <br>
   return stamp.<br>
<p>
   Keep in mind that you won't receive a report if the return envelope<br>
   is not addressed properly or a stamp or $1 bill is not included.<br>
   It is a good idea to include your email address as well so any<br>
   problems can be resolved via email.<br>
<p>
   It is essential that you supply the correct report name and number<br>
   to the person you are ordering from.  You will need all four<br>
   reports because you will be reprinting and re-selling them.  Do not<br>
   alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say.<br>
   It is important that you *always* provide same day service on all<br>
   orders that you fill.<br>
<p>
2. Replace the name and address under report #1 with yours, moving<br>
   the one that was there down to report #2.  Drop the name <br>
   and address under report #2 to report #3, moving the one that was<br>
   there to report #4.  The name and address that was under report<br>
   #4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way<br>
   to the bank.  When doing this, make certain you type the names and<br>
   addresses accurately!  DO NOT MIX UP MOVING PRODUCT/REPORT <br>
   POSITIONS!<br>
<p>
3. Having made the required changes in the name list, save it as a<br>
   text file in its own directory to be used with whatever e-mail<br>
   program you like.  Report #3 will tell you the best methods of bulk<br>
   emailing and aquiring email lists.  See below for instructions on<br>
   receiving preformed email lists.<br>
<p>
4. Email a copy of the entire program (all of this is very important)<br>
   to everyone whose address you can get your hands on.  Start with<br>
   friends and relatives, since you can encourage them to take<br>
   advantage of this fabulous opportunity.  Don't forget to order<br>
   email lists as mentioned below.<br>
<p>
   IMPORTANT: You won't get a good response if you use an old list, so<br>
   always request a fresh, new list.  You will find out where to<br>
   purchase these lists when you order the four reports, or you can<br>
   get started now by ordering lists as mentioned below.<br>
<p>

**********************************************************************<br>
<p>
                             Your Guarantee <br>
<p>
The check point which guarantees your success is simply this: You <br>
must receive 15 to 20 orders for report #1. This is a must! If you <br>
don't within two weeks, email out more programs until you do. Then <br>
a couple of weeks later, you should receive at least 100 orders for <br>
report #2.  If you don't, send out more programs until you do. Once <br>
you have received 100 or more orders for report #2, take a deep breath<br>
and sit back and relax, because you are going to make at least $50,000. <br>
Mathematically, it is a proven guarantee.  Of those who have <br>
participated in the program and reached the above guarantees *all* <br>
have reached their $50,000 goal. Also, remember, every time your <br>
name is moved down the list,  you are in front of a different report, <br>
so you can keep track of your program by knowing what people are <br>
ordering from you. <br>
<p>
Remember: "He who dares nothing, need hope for nothing."<br>
