I am having the same problem and it has got drastically worse. My UDB<br>
was setup as dual boot between NT and Linux and two weeks ago I<br>
started using the NT extensively. I found that if I left the machine<br>
on overnight it would crash with a PAL error. Like you I suspected a<br>
heat problem and took measures to relieve it but it did not help and<br>
finally I called the vendor who suggested possible SIMM problems but<br>
I have good quality DEC memory supplied by the vendor and swapping out<br>
pairs of SIMMS didn't help as the problem occured with any combination<br>
of the available SIMMS. The vendor also suggested trying to repair NT<br>
in case it was an NT problem as I had not been having any problems with<br>
Linux.<br>
<p>
After the NT repair option (which identified some problems)I was very<br>
busy with real work but would turn my monitor periodically to verify<br>
that NT was still up. Unfortunately I didn't try jiggling the mouse or<br>
typing on the keyboard and the machine had in fact frozen as you<br>
describe:-(<br>
<p>
This Friday I rebooted into Linux intending to get some useful `work'<br>
down and cursing MS for an unreliable operating system and of course<br>
the mouse/keyboard lock up then happened in Linux. As I had had the<br>
machine for several months without problems I was convinced that it<br>
was some form of corruption caused by incompetence on my part and<br>
decided to do a clean install of both operating systems and to reset<br>
the UDB to its default state. Big mistake! The machine froze up twice<br>
during reformatting of the system partition using arcinst.exe. Finally<br>
I got past that problem and went to bed late regreting not having<br>
waited to call the vendor on Monday. This morning I attempted to<br>
install NT but the keyboard/mouse lockups started happening but I got<br>
enough installed such that the machine will boot into NT but not far<br>
enough that NT is fully configured. However the machine stability has<br>
collapsed to the point that when I turn it on nothing happens - my<br>
monitor (Nanao F2-17EX) indicates no signal from the UDB although the<br>
(external) drive spins up and the green led next to the networking<br>
ports on the back comes on.<br>
<p>
I do not think this is a static problem ( i live in AL - an area<br>
renowned for humidity although it has been dry lately) but will see<br>
what the vendor says on Monday. Any and all suggestions welcome in the<br>
interim.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;Has anyone else had problems with the keyboard and mouse freezing up</i><br>
on a UDB?  I'm inclined to blame heat build-up, as this doesn't<br>
happen when i move the machine out of the corner into the middle of<br>
the floor, any other suggestions on cooling this thing a little more<br>
(its already in tower mode w/o an internal drive.)<br>
<p>
thanks<br>
