Hiya!<br>
<p>
I'm having Linux running now pretty stable on my Miata (PWS 433a), and<br>
overall it works quite well. However, there are still some quirks which<br>
bother me a bit.<br>
<p>
First: My syslog is full of "unaligned traps". According to <br>
grep "unaligned trap" /var/log/messages | wc, I have had now way over<br>
20'000 unaligned trap errors during the last two days. The total uptime<br>
during these days was about ten hours.<br>
<p>
/proc/cpuinfo tells me there were even 832165 "kernel unaligned acc" and<br>
1138 "user unaligned acc" during an uptime of 3:19. All I was doing was<br>
reading news and using my Miata as a 433 MHz x-terminal to use the<br>
Linux/i386 version of maple :)<br>
<p>
I know that "unaligned" accesses can happen from time to time, especially <br>
beacuse Alphas are not very wide spread among the Linux developers, but the <br>
number I have seems to be rather high.<br>
<p>
Second: The clock runs quite fast -- after one "real" hour, the system<br>
time has advanced about one hour and ten minutes. The CMOS time reported<br>
by clock -Au -r is correct, however. <br>
<p>
I knew I've got a fast machine, but I thought the clock would make an<br>
exception to this :-)<br>
<p>
Third: The driver for the parallel printer port seems to be quite broken. <br>
It seems that some characters get lost, since the printer (an old HP<br>
Deskjet 510 which has been running faithfully during the last few years on<br>
an Amiga 500, an Amiga 2000 and a Pentium System) randomly "throws in" <br>
some text characters and sometimes even form feeds while printing<br>
graphics. The errors are different every time, and since a PCL file which<br>
works flawlessly when I "copy file lpt1:" under NT produces "random" <br>
errors when I "cat file &gt;/dev/lp0" under Linux, I think the driver is<br>
to blame. Nothing special, just normal "parallel printer support" in the<br>
Linux kernel.<br>
<p>
The first and the second problem occur whether I use<br>
miata-kernel-2029-complete.gz from gatekeeper.dec.com or a self-made one<br>
(linux 2.0.30 + axp-diffs 2.0.21 + miata-diffs 2.0.29 + manual cleaning-up<br>
of some rejects + tulip.c v0.73 4/16/97).<br>
<p>
The third problem occurs only using the self-made kernel because<br>
miata-kernel-2029-complete.gz obviously lacks parallel printer support.<br>
However, I don't think my pathches have broken something in the parallel<br>
printer driver.<br>
<p>
So, the goal of this rather lengthy message is to ask if someone has<br>
experienced similar problems on a Miata (or on a different Alpha), and<br>
ideally if someone has already come up with some kind of fix.<br>
<p>
