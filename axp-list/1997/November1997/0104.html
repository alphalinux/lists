Help!<br>
<p>
 Last night, I had a process running on my PC164 that basically<br>
 consumed all the real memory available. (9000 seconds into a<br>
 30000 second or so run) Not sure what happened,<br>
 but the process was accessing an NFS file from another Linux<br>
 box and the process stopped but one of the nfsiod's went into<br>
 a hard cpu loop. I'd guess the nfsiod probably couldn't get<br>
 memory and this made it break. First, I tried to kill the nfsiod<br>
 but that didn't work and whatever it was doing, it had the NFS<br>
 server hung too so I rebooted the NFS server and then did the<br>
 same for the PC164. The server came back up and complained about<br>
 files system inconsistencies but finally came up happy. Well,<br>
 the PC164 system went into the milo screen and showed a crazy<br>
 prompt, something like:<br>
<p>
 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt;<br>
 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt; 0&gt;<br>
 <br>
 When I tried to type in something, it kept saying try 'Help'<br>
 to find out what to type. Now, I know how to type in the<br>
 boot command so that wasn't the problem. Also, when I typed,<br>
 it didn't echo anything. So, I hit the reset button and tried<br>
 it again. Same thing happened. Well, I figured I'd hosed the<br>
 file system somehow so I got out my milo/pc164 floppies,<br>
 added an entry in the ARC console to boot from the floppy,<br>
 and tried that. Same thing happened again!! So, I tried to<br>
 boot WinNT in my other partition and it complained about a<br>
 hardware problem. This caused some concern. So, I stuck in the<br>
 WinNT cdrom and recovered things to see if that would fix<br>
 NT. It did. I can now get into WinNT without any problems.<br>
 However, I still can't get Linux back up. Milo keeps giving<br>
 the crazy prompt and won't echo anything or accept a proper<br>
 boot command. I also went and got the latest milo from the<br>
 DEC ftp site and it too gives the same behavior.<br>
 <br>
 So, editing the NVRAM works for boot entries, and WinNT now<br>
 works again. Any ideas what to do to fix Milo/Linux??<br>
 <br>
 One other thing, I was using a 128MB swap file so I shouldn't<br>
 have gotten here in the first place. But, that's a minor issue<br>
 if I can't get Linux back up.<br>
 <br>
