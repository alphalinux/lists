<i>&gt;These are applied to a pristine 2.0.30 source tree in the following manner:</i><br>

<p>
Are there any plans to add these patches for the 2.0.31 kernel?  The best <br>
luck I had was when using glibc2 with a kernel compiled under glibc2.  <br>
The kernel was completely stock, and I didn't see much in the way of <br>
unaligned trap problems.  The new milo works great, but as with anything <br>
else its hard to tell what is helping what.<br>
<p>
Currently I see the best option as using the stock 2.0.30 tree with the 2 <br>
genie patches, after upgrading to glibc2 (or just starting with the new <br>
redhat beta to simplify things).  This is based partly on personal <br>
experience, and partly on what I've extrapolated from Harvey Stein's <br>
*excellent* kernel/patches notes.<br>
<p>
Another option may be to use the stock 2.0.31 kernel, which may fix the <br>
trap bug already - is there any word on what alpha specific fixes were <br>
merged into the 2.0.31 kernel?  I'm not particularly concerned with em86 <br>
support, more with the overall stability and performance of the machine. <br>
i.e. - if there is a bug in the kernel that will kill my machine, I want <br>
to get rid of it.  It seems the usual advice is to try things out and see <br>
how they work, but I'd be willing to bet that people who are experiencing <br>
problems have one of the few variables which can crash a machine in <br>
common.<br>
<p>
I have a stress test program which was originally given to me to stress <br>
linux/intel machines, but also works on the alpha.  By the middle of next <br>
week I should have some time to test out a few different configs, but if <br>
anyone wants to give it a shot on there own, it might be interesting to <br>
map out what combinations of milo/kernel/patches are more stable than <br>
others.  My particular interest is from people who don't have any <br>
problems at all, i.e. - I'd be interested to see if it is because the <br>
machines aren't heavily loaded, or because they have a good config.<br>
<p>
At any rate, if anyone has any interest let me know, and I'll post the <br>
stress program on our ftp site. <br>
