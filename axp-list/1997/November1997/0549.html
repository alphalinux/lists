   [snip] The next revision of Debian is supposed to fully<br>
   support Alpha.<br>
Oh? can anyone confirm this?<br>
<p>
   [snip]<br>
<p>
   Now, I do think they are smoking dope if they think they will sell many<br>
   RHmember subscriptions at $299.00, that smacks of the Caldera reality<br>
   distortion field.  We, my company paid only about $50 more for a full one<br>
   year support contract awhile back.  Add it up, Redhat has only had 3 or<br>
   fewer revisions in a given year in the past.  Even if you paid full price<br>
   for 3 boxed sets + shipping, AND bought a ball cap, AND figured in a 10%<br>
   discount on the typical amount of Redhat products you bought in a year,<br>
   you would still fall almost $100 short of the $299 membership fee.  What<br>
   kind of "deal" is that?  Thats alot of money to pay for the convenience of<br>
   getting the dists automatically.  Yes, I know there are other unnamed<br>
   perks.  But as you can see this is not gonna be for the 'typical' RedHat<br>
   user.<br>
Don't forget the `membership card'.  That's got to be worth a lot.<br>

On a more serious note, UNIX vendors have always pretended that they<br>
created the products that they are selling by omitting credits to the<br>
original authors.  RH's 5.0 press release on their web site reads like<br>
they invented the idea of community development and the nifty new<br>
technology: Glibc.<br>
<p>
This has a far too familiar ring to it: back when I was fairly new on<br>
UNIX systems, we purchased SCO's TCP/IP - from Lachman.  The<br>
documentation was not very good and included several rewrites of Eric<br>
Allman's papers on Sendmail.  The kick was that nobody was listed as<br>
original authors and there were no references to the BSD doc - which<br>
was much better than the `edited' version.  Similarly, there are<br>
never any credits in published man pages unless the stuff has been<br>
copyrighted with a specific clause requiring credits: witness the<br>
implicit claims of ownership of uuencode/uudecode, PPP, SLIP, etc.<br>
<p>
SOABOX++<br>
<p>
The UNIX programming community is the primary source of innovation in<br>
S/W and has been for the last 20 years or so.  It just `ain't right'<br>
that commercialization of its technical successes is achieved by overt<br>
or implicit claims of ownership.  If it weren't for the work RMS has<br>
done on the copyleft, there wouldn't be Linux and it would be just too<br>
tempting for RH and others to just grab all the S/W, make a few<br>
inconsequential changes for the sake of incompatibility with other<br>
distributions, call the result proprietary S/W, and sell it with their<br>
name and no other.  SCO built a pretty large operation that way - for<br>
a while.  Bill Gates has made this into a fine art.  They all do it,<br>
given the opportunity.<br>
<p>
SOAPBOX--<br>
<p>
Regarding liking RH.  I'm of a mixed mind.  It depends on how they<br>
grow the company, i.e. how greedy they get.  Historically, companies<br>
begin by leveraging off of the community and then trash out the<br>
developers.  This is justified by the 80/20 rule: they discover that<br>
80% of their profits come from 20% of their customers and so<br>
`naturally' concentrate on the most effective means of generating<br>
profit.  This reasoning neglects the fact that 80% of the new product<br>
and development comes from that 20% profit base.<br>
<p>
I don't know, but suspect that a company which maintains really good<br>
faith with the community will do much better in the long run than one<br>
which does not.  The community really doesn't want too much:<br>
 - acknowledgement<br>
 - source access<br>
 - pretty minimal support<br>
 -  to see the product of their labor put to use<br>
 - and the opportunity to do some small amount of business in order to<br>
   support their programming addiction.<br>
<p>
Does any of this stuff make it to RH management or are we just farting<br>
in the wind when we talk about this kind of thing?<br>
