(chuckle) geez steve, one would have thought this stuff had been buried<br>
by now, but since you 'opted' for this thread, here is a description of<br>
what this virus can do (snicker):<br>
<p>
This is the most DANGEROUS e-mail virus ever.<br>
 <br>
"It will rewrite your hard drive and scramble any disks that are even<br>
close to your computer.  It will recalibrate your freezer's coolness<br>
setting so all your ice cream melts.  It will demagnetize the strips on<br>
all your credit cards, screw up the tracking on your VCR, and use<br>
subspace field harmonics to render any CDs you try to play unreadable.<br>
<p>
"It will give your ex-boy/girlfriend/ex-husband/wife your new phone <br>
number.  It will mix antifreeze into your fishtank.  It will drink all<br>
your beer and leave its socks out on the coffee table when company is<br>
coming over.  It will put a kitten in the back pocket of your good suit<br>
and hide your car keys when you are late for work.<br>
 <br>
"It will make you fall in love with a "penguin".  It will give you<br>
nightmares about circus midgets.  It will pour sugar in your gas tank<br>
and shave off both your eyebrows while dating your current boy/girl-<br>
friend behind your back and billing the dinner and hotel room to your<br>
Visa card.<br>
 <br>
"It moves your car randomly around parking lots so you can't find it.<br>
It will tease your dog.  It will leave strange messages on your boss's<br>
voicemail in your voice.  It is insidious and subtle.  It is dangerous<br>
and terrifying to behold.  It is also a rather interesting shade of<br>
mauve.<br>
 <br>
"It will give you Dutch Elm disease.  It will leave the toilet seat up.<br>
It will make a batch of methamphetamine in your bathtub and leave bacon<br>
cooking on the stove while it goes out to chase high school kids with<br>
your snowblower.<br>
 <br>
 "These are just a few of the signs.  Be very, very afraid!"<br>
 <br>

NOW, want something really scarey?<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
In an announcement that has stunned the computer industry, Ken Thompson,<br>
Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan admitted that the Unix operating <br>
system and C programming language created by them is an elaborate prank <br>
kept alive for over 20 years. Speaking at the recent UnixWorld Software <br>
Development Forum, Thompson revealed the following:<br>
<p>
"In 1969, AT&amp;T had just terminated their work with the GE/Honeywell/AT&amp;T<br>
Multics project. Brian and I had started work with an early release of<br>
Pascal from Professor Niklaus Wirth's ETH labs in Switzerland and we<br>
were impressed with its elegant simplicity and power. Dennis had just<br>
finished reading 'Bored of the Rings', a National Lampoon parody of the<br>
Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. As a lark, we decided to do<br>
parodies of the Multics environment and Pascal. Dennis and I were<br>
responsible for the operating environment. We looked at Multics and<br>
designed the new OS to be as complex and cryptic as possible to maximize<br>
casual users' frustration levels, calling it Unix as a parody of<br>
Multics, as well as other more risque allusions. We sold the terse<br>
command language to novitiates by telling them that it saved them<br>
typing.<br>
<p>
Then Dennis and Brian worked on a warped version of Pascal, called 'A'.<br>
'A' looked a lot like Pascal, but elevated the notion of the direct<br>
memory address (which Wirth had banished) to the central concept of the<br>
language. This was Dennis's contribution, and he in fact coined the term <br>
"pointer" as an innocuous sounding name for a truly malevolent<br>
construct.<br>
<p>
Brian must be credited with the idea of having absolutely no standard<br>
I/O specification: this ensured that at least 50% of the typical<br>
commercial program would have to be re-coded when changing hardware<br>
platforms. Brian was also responsible for pitching this lack of I/O as a <br>
feature: it allowed us to describe the language as "truly portable".<br>
<p>
When we found others were actually creating real programs with A, we<br>
removed compulsory type-checking on function arguments. Later, we added<br>
a notion we called "casting": this allowed the programmer to treat an<br>
integer as though it were a 50kb user-defined structure. When we found<br>
that some programmers were simply not using pointers, we eliminated the<br>
ability to pass structures to functions, enforcing their use in even the <br>
Simplest applications. We sold this, and many other features, as<br>
enhancements to the efficiency of the language. In this way, our prank<br>
evolved into B, BCPL, and finally C. We stopped when we got a clean<br>
compile on the following syntax:<br>
<p>
for (;P("\n"),R-;P("|"))for(e=3DC;e-;P("_"+(*u++/8)%2))P("|"+(*u/4)%2);<br>
<p>
At one time, we joked about selling this to the Soviets to set their<br>
computer science progress back 20 or more years.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, AT&amp;T and other US corporations actually began using Unix<br>
and C. We decided we'd better keep mum, assuming it was just a passing<br>
phase. In fact, it's taken US companies over 20 years to develop enough<br>
expertise to generate useful applications using this 1960's<br>
technological parody. We are impressed with the tenacity of the general<br>
Unix and C programmer. In fact, Brian, Dennis and I have never ourselves <br>
attempted to write a commercial application in this environment.<br>
<p>
We feel really guilty about the chaos, confusion and truly awesome<br>
programming projects that have resulted from our silly prank so long<br>
ago."<br>
<p>
Dennis Ritchie said: "What really tore it (just when ADA was catching<br>
on), was that Bjarne Stroustrup caught onto our joke. He extended it to<br>
further parody, Smalltalk. Like us, he was caught by surprise when<br>
Nobody laughed. So he added multiple inheritance, virtual base classes,<br>
and later ... templates. All to no avail. So we now have compilers that<br>
can compile 100,000 lines per second, but need to process header files<br>
for 25 minutes before they get to the meat of "Hello, World".<br>
<p>
Major Unix and C vendors and customers, including AT&amp;T, Microsoft,<br>
Hewlett-Packard, GTE, NCR, and DEC have refused comment at this time.<br>
Borland International, a leading vendor of object-oriented tools,<br>
including the popular Turbo Pascal and Borland C++, stated they had<br>
suspected this for a couple of years. In fact, the notoriously late<br>
Quattro Pro for Windows was originally written in C++. Philippe Kahn<br>
said: "After two and a half years programming, and massive programmer<br>
burn-outs, we re-coded the whole thing in Turbo Pascal in three months.<br>
I think it's fair to say that Turbo Pascal saved our bacon". Another<br>
Borland spokesman said that they would continue to enhance their Pascal<br>
products and halt further efforts to develop C/C++.<br>
<p>
Professor Wirth of the ETH institute and father of the Pascal, Modula 2<br>
and Oberon structured languages, cryptically said "P.T. Barnum was<br>
right." He had no further comments.<br>
<p>
[see, i told you it was scarey]<br>
<p>
(btw) can anyone point me to the 13th missing POSIX list<br>
<p>
(chuckle) have a great weekend folks, <br>
