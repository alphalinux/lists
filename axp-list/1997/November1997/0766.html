<i>&gt; 1) How stable is the Alpha Linux kernel, does this really approach the Intel </i><br>
<i>&gt; kernel now in stability?</i><br>
<p>
I think that for home use (as opposed to server use) Alpha/Linux is quite<br>
stable enough (and probably for server use as well).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2) How is the hardware compatability: memory, SCSI, disks, zip drives, printers, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and especially soundcards (AWE64?)</i><br>
<p>
I think I heard some complaints about sound support on this list.<br>
Otherwise a lot of hardware just works as it would on Intel.  Be careful<br>
about video-cards, though, as AlphaBIOS isn't always as good at emulating<br>
an x86 for executing the video-bios.  (I know from personal experience...)<br>
I've got a built-in NCR3c815 and an Adaptec AHA-2940UW which run just<br>
fine.  SCSI works smoothly.  So SCSI ZIP-drives shouldn't be a problem.  I<br>
don't know about parallel ZIP.<br>
Memory on an Alpha usually has to be true parity SIMMS or ECC SDRAM, from<br>
what I hear.  This means you can't always buy standard memory.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 5) As I do not want to have to compile my own software for the Alpha (or </i><br>
<i>&gt; (re)compile the kernel if at all possible) it is nice to see more RPM's and </i><br>
<i>&gt; tarballs available. But how about commercial software like Stata, Applixware, </i><br>
<i>&gt; CDE, Netscape, to name the ones I use. Do these run at all comfortably under </i><br>
<i>&gt; EM86, or do they even run at all. Is there software that has problems with EM86?</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Stata for example still uses a.out).</i><br>
<p>
AFAIK Applixware and CDE are available for native Linux/Alpha.  You also<br>
might want to give KDE a try.  Some website's got Alpha rpms available,<br>
but I forget which one.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 7) Does EM86 have problems with Linux (RH 5.0 say). Is EM86 just as good as </i><br>
<i>&gt; FX!32 or is it a shabby port?</i><br>
<p>
I haven't used em86 myself, but AFAIK em86 is better than FX!32.  I think<br>
FX!32 only runs DOS-programs, no Windows apps.  em86 runs Linux/Intel<br>
apps.<br>
I've heard em86 is based on FX!32 btw.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 8) Where do you get EM86, from Digital? Is it expensive, do you buy a license or </i><br>
<i>&gt; software?</i><br>
<p>
No !  It's available for free !  But it isn't too obvious, from what I<br>
hear.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 10) How about installation of Linux (RH4.x or 5.x). Does this, in general, go </i><br>
<i>&gt; just as smooth as RH on Intel Pentiums or are there peculiarities that really </i><br>
<i>&gt; distinguish the Alpha from the Intel. I would not be interested in a machine </i><br>
<i>&gt; that I would have to spend 1 to say 8 weeks coaxing along just to get Linux </i><br>
<i>&gt; installed and then again maybe another couple of months just to iron out the </i><br>
<i>&gt; kinks and get it running smoothly. I use my machine to work and not to wrestle </i><br>
<i>&gt; with. I don't want especially to be a bleeding edge pioneer (or is the Alpha </i><br>
<i>&gt; past that phase).</i><br>
<p>
The difficult part of installing Linux/Alpha is getting Milo to boot the<br>
kernel.  If that's dealt with, you probably won't have too much trouble.<br>
I've had quite a lot of trouble getting milo to work, but I've tested milo<br>
for RedHat 5.0, and it worked perfectly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 11) In the light of 9) above how about MILO. Does MILO have any quirks or </i><br>
<i>&gt; peculiarities that distinguish it from LILO (BIOS, disks, controllers, etc).</i><br>
<p>
Milo uses the same drivers and filesystems Linux does, so no need to run<br>
lilo every time you recompile your kernel any more.  :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 12) How about ISP connectivity (modems, ISDN, cable modems, etc?).</i><br>
<p>
Haven't tested that out.<br>
