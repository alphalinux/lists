<i>&gt;  I am not sure if this has been fixed, but I don't think so.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, it seems pretty stable.  It's only been up a couple days, but<br>
yesterday I moved all the user accounts, web server, and samba server over<br>
to it and it's been going alright.  There have been a few problems with<br>
unaligned errors, more ECC errors, and even some traps (I think from<br>
tcpdump) but nothing has stopped working.  It's a little scary, but so<br>
far, so good...<br>
<p>
However, I do have one problem; FTP does not work.  I did an insmod<br>
ip_masq_ftp.o but that had no effect.  FTP session cannot build the data<br>
connection.  I tried to rmmod it, but rmmod said it wasn't loaded, and at<br>
the same time refuses to let me insmod it again.  lsmod shows it using one<br>
page with no connections, but FTP simply does not work.<br>
<p>
Also, nsnotify.exe (on Win95) can't log in, though messenger works fine. <br>
I don't understand that one at all. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; My second question concerns memory.  The UDB had two 16MB true parity</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; matched SIMMs, but upon booting only reported 24MB.  Following the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; instructions on the list, I got the latest MILO from gatekeeper today and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; installed it onto my 4MB FAT partition.  linload.exe is not easy to find.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This did not help.  I took two additional 16MB true parity non-matched</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; SIMMs and put them in the UDB (in slots 0&amp;1) and moved the original SIMMs</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to slots 2&amp;3.  Now, upon booting, it reports 32MB.  Adding the kernel</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; option "mem=64M" from the ARC OSLOADOPTIONS didn't help, nor did adding it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; from MILO.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  It is a feature of ARC, that when you run milo by naming it updatefw.exe </i><br>
<i>&gt;  and picking "Install new firmware", to boot in a sort of special mode. In</i><br>
<i>&gt;  this mode, the machine will ALWAYS report 24MB of RAM, nothing you tell</i><br>
<i>&gt;  milo will change that later on. So don't boot it like this, but use a proper</i><br>
<i>&gt;  boot entry in the ARC menu.</i><br>
<p>
Okay, this is where the 24MB came from.  But now I am booting from the ARC<br>
menu.  It says, "Linux" and loads linload.exe/noname.arc sitting on my 4MB<br>
FAT partition as /dev/sda1, but even though I have 4 16MB SIMMs, it<br>
reports 32MB.  As I said above, I tried appending "mem=64M" from the ARC<br>
options menu, but it still reports only 32MB.  I moved the 32MB that was<br>
there initially into the third and fourth slots, so it sees only the new<br>
memory.  Since the old memory *was* working, I would've hoped it say 64MB.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I was also disappointed to see that XF86Setup does not work on alpha, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There are TGA setups floating around the net. mail me if you really can't</i><br>
<i>&gt; find one.</i><br>
<p>
My problem is that I have a crappy monitor.  It'll 1024x768 Interlaced<br>
(which the UDB can't do) so I wanted to use that xvidtune with it, too.  I<br>
have another problem in that hitting Ctrl-Alt-+/- causes X to crash.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; that RedHat does not ship the xforms development library stock.  I'll be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; looking for these and GIMP RPMs in the contrib area soon.  Does anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; happen to know if Apache and PHP compile clean on Alpha?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I think they compile well, though I am running stock rpm's here. (But if</i><br>
<i>&gt;  it compiles on our hp-sux machine, it MUST work on an alpha too :)</i><br>
<p>
Which one?  All three?  :)<br>

I wouldn't use PHP 2.0 yet ... it's rather buggy.  Wait for 2.01 or .02<br>
<p>
<p>
Thanks for the info (so far...)<br>
