'Relatively' affordable Alpha machines are becoming available now in Holland.<br>
I am in the process of selecting a new machine for next year and one of the <br>
possibilities is a Digital Alpha because of the horsepower and because I would <br>
like to get away from Intel as much as possible, if possible.<br>
<p>
The choice would be a Digital AlphaPC 164LX board and a 21164PC 533 MHz <br>
processor. However browsing the axp-list archive does not exactly distill much <br>
confidence in the workability of such a solution (for me).<br>
I hope some of you experienced Alpha users will be so kind as to answer the <br>
following questions.<br>
<p>
First what do I use a PC for: I use my PC at home, quite intensively, for <br>
statistical analysis, research and simulation for which I have no time at work. <br>
(using the statistical package Stata for Linux). I also have a music hobby (Jazz <br>
midi sequencer). I do not program (except for statistical routines in the Stata <br>
programming languange and some bash futilities). I am not interested in graphics <br>
(except in relation to statistics) or games, networking, servers, etc.<br>
I am quite sophisticated hardware wise and relatively experienced in Linux (now <br>
1.5 years) and use Linux as my only OS at home and at work.<br>
<p>
The questions:<br>
<p>
1) How stable is the Alpha Linux kernel, does this really approach the Intel <br>
kernel now in stability?<br>
<p>
2) How is the hardware compatability: memory, SCSI, disks, zip drives, printers, <br>
and especially soundcards (AWE64?)<br>
<p>
3) How about stable drivers for the above mentioned hardware?<br>
<p>
4) How is the Digital 164LX mainboard hardware compatability?  Can you just plug <br>
in any SCSI controller, disk, soundcard, zipdrive, etc.? How about the BIOS?<br>
 <br>
5) As I do not want to have to compile my own software for the Alpha (or <br>
(re)compile the kernel if at all possible) it is nice to see more RPM's and <br>
tarballs available. But how about commercial software like Stata, Applixware, <br>
CDE, Netscape, to name the ones I use. Do these run at all comfortably under <br>
EM86, or do they even run at all. Is there software that has problems with EM86?<br>
(Stata for example still uses a.out).<br>
<p>
6) Is anybody running Applix or CDE under EM86, please comment?<br>
<p>
7) Does EM86 have problems with Linux (RH 5.0 say). Is EM86 just as good as <br>
FX!32 or is it a shabby port?<br>
<p>
8) Where do you get EM86, from Digital? Is it expensive, do you buy a license or <br>
software?<br>
<p>
9) How do apps under EM86 compare to native 64 bit software (benchmarks?) <br>
 <br>
10) How about installation of Linux (RH4.x or 5.x). Does this, in general, go <br>
just as smooth as RH on Intel Pentiums or are there peculiarities that really <br>
distinguish the Alpha from the Intel. I would not be interested in a machine <br>
that I would have to spend 1 to say 8 weeks coaxing along just to get Linux <br>
installed and then again maybe another couple of months just to iron out the <br>
kinks and get it running smoothly. I use my machine to work and not to wrestle <br>
with. I don't want especially to be a bleeding edge pioneer (or is the Alpha <br>
past that phase).<br>
<p>
11) In the light of 9) above how about MILO. Does MILO have any quirks or <br>
peculiarities that distinguish it from LILO (BIOS, disks, controllers, etc).<br>
<p>
12) How about ISP connectivity (modems, ISDN, cable modems, etc?).<br>
<p>
I would appreciate it very much if one or more of you Alpha guru's would take <br>
the time to answer one or more of the above questions (as honestly as possible).<br>
