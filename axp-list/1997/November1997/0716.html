<i>&gt; 1) What experience have people had with : Microway, Aspen, and DCG?</i><br>

<p>
I have a Microway 533 MHz Screamer and another guy has an older Aspen<br>
Alpine with a 275 MHz processor.  Microway has been quite supportive<br>
when I've called them about the system.  The Aspen has DEC UNIX and is<br>
a couple of years old.  It hasn't been used so much.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3)Are commercial fortran 77 packages for Linux worth the extra expense</i><br>
<i>&gt; as compared to f2c and gcc? If so, which do you recommend?  Some past</i><br>
<i>&gt; posts indicate that f2c is broken on Alpha Linux. Is this true? As the</i><br>
<i>&gt; primary usage of the workstation will be to compile and run F77 code,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I need to know that there is a stable and efficient fortran compiler</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the Alpha.</i><br>
<p>
I got my system with Microway's NDP FORTRAN compiler.  It sucks.  I got<br>
their 32 bit compiler first, this had a lot of problems and they sent me their<br>
64 bit release.  This fixed some problems, but other things did not work.<br>
The documentation lists a lot of options that either do not work or have<br>
been removed.  The debugging also either does not work or is bad.  The<br>
compiler does not support conversion of big-endian binary data nor the <br>
pointer statement.  The code it generates always ran significantly slower <br>
than code generated on DEC's FORTRAN -- I also have a 500MHz Alphastation,<br>
which I compared against.  I did not try f2c/gcc because of the problems I <br>
heard about it.  I am converting my system to DEC UNIX + DEC FORTRAN.  I <br>
also know that NAG has FORTRAN for the alpha, but I have not heard anything <br>
about its performance.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 4)How stable is Redhat 4.2 for the Alpha? Or should I wait till 5.0 is</i><br>
<i>&gt; out? And when will that be?</i><br>
<p>
I have had some very annoying problems with Linux on the Alpha and find it<br>
rather buggy -- such as programs bombing with the complaint "Cant get a free<br>
page".   We use NIS and this does not work well with the Alpha -- I had to<br>
turn it off.  I believe things will get better with the new releases, but<br>
the machine needs to produce, hence the move to DEC UNIX.<br>
<p>
DEC has bought Microsoft's FORTRAN compiler and has it for the Alpha.<br>
Microway has said to me that NT with DEC's compiler runs very well, but <br>
they also claim their compiler is good.  I don't know what the DEC<br>
compiler costs, but it might be a good solution for a single user.  DEC<br>
UNIX licensing and DEC FORTRAN licensing are damned expensive.<br>
<p>
I like a lot about Linux, but because of the compiler situation and the<br>
other problems with the Redhat 4.2 on alpha, we have to switch to the<br>
commercial UNIX, so the workstation will cost twice as much, but still<br>
much cheaper than buying a DEC Alphastation.<br>
<p>
