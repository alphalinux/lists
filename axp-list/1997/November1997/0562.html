   It definitely makes it through. Press releases are not an appropriate place<br>
   for such acknowledgements as they must be short and are read mostly<br>
   by corporate types.<br>

First, thanks for your courteous and prompt response.<br>
<p>
Second, I disagree that Press releases are inappropriate precisely<br>
because they are `read mostly by corporate types.'  The `corporate<br>
types' are the ones who think UNIX et al is unimportant and that<br>
Microsoft &amp; major industry players originated most of the stuff they<br>
use.  Inasmuch as `corporate types' are the ones who write the checks,<br>
we badly need that they understand how the tools they depend on were<br>
originated and proven out.  They need to understand that they have the<br>
most to lose if software patents and proprietariness tie up the<br>
community to the point where we are unable to develop with minimal<br>
restrictions.<br>
<p>
I think that this is the point of RMS's incessant harping on `please<br>
give credit and publicly promote the cause of free software'.  RMS<br>
comes off as kind of extreme, but most of his positions are well<br>
reasoned - correct or not.  I don't think he will -ever- be taken<br>
seriously by `corporate types', but you guys may be in a different<br>
position - inasmuch as you are in this for profit.<br>
<p>
Anyway, I think it would be really beneficial if RH can champion the<br>
recognition of the independent s/w development community to corporate<br>
management.  It really doesn't make much difference how good GNU tools<br>
and the Linux OS is if I can't get the stuff into my client's shop in<br>
competition against uSoft.  This has a ripple effect in that it slows<br>
down Linux ports of important business software - Informix, for<br>
example.<br>
<p>
Anyway, thanks for letting me babble.<br>
