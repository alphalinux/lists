<p>
Yes, but space is very tight. It's not so much which cards will work, as a<br>
good sampling of PCI-based cards will work, it's what will physically fit in<br>
the box. I'm satisfied with the built-in, so I never investigated it<br>
thoroughly.<br>
Some guys on this board have experience, and they'll either answer, or<br>
direct you to the archives for this mailing list...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What is the max external SCSI CD-ROM I can run on this box?  The place I</i><br>

<p>
They're on drugs. So long as it's SCSI, the Alpha does not care about it's<br>
speed. I've seen some 24x IDE models. Frankly, it does not matter unless you<br>
are running some game that brings animation &amp; sound over from the CD while it<br>
runs.<br>
For installing Linux or whatever, which is what I do, an old 2x was more than<br>
enough. :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Which modems work on these boxes?  I would like to get at least 33k, but a</i><br>
<i>&gt; k56flex would be preferable.</i><br>
<p>
I suppose there's no issue here. Obviously get an external unit. Be aware that<br>
there's special cabling off of the serial port. Dec decided to wire both ports<br>
into a single connector, and you have to make a "Y" cable to go to the two<br>
external devices. Wiring diagrams in the archives.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Can you put in 60ns memory chips or is the DEC system pretty finicky about</i><br>
<i>&gt; 70ns chips?</i><br>
<p>
Ho ho ho! Very finicky. It won't mind the faster speed, but it's adamant about<br>
Parity and layout (2x34). Onsale sells the chips sometimes, and they're<br>
certainly not very hard to find -- but they are NOT stock PC memory chips!<br>
