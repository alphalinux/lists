Subject: ANNOUNCE: Informix on Linux Status Report <br>
<p>
Important Information Regarding Informix On Linux<br>
=================================================<br>
<p>
For:   General Release<br>
<p>
From:  Tim Schaefer, IIUG Informix-on-Linux Committee Chair<br>
       Carlton Doe, Head of International Informix User Group Advocacy<br>
<p>
What follows is an official statement from Informix.  This message was<br>
prepared by Erin Kinikin, and Tony Velcich, both of Informix Software.<br>
<p>
There will be additional information in the form of follow-up postings,<br>
so please do not jump to conclusions regarding information contained <br>
herein.  Carlton and other committee members will be providing more<br>
information as they are able.  Please read this message completely<br>
and thoroughly before responding.<br>
<p>
Background<br>
==========<br>
<p>
I talked to Carlton on Sunday, 16 November 1997, regarding the latest <br>
activity at Informix, and there are some extremely positive developments <br>
regarding porting the Informix software to Linux.  Carlton received this<br>
message from Informix, and has passed it on to me for distribution.  <br>
<p>
Informix has released this statement, along with more information that will <br>
be shared with the committee, and eventually the general list.  Not all the <br>
details are enclosed in this statement, more information will be coming out <br>
to the general list shortly.<br>
<p>
What follows in the next few days will depend entirely on the Linux <br>
community.  Informix has indicated they are ready to move forward with <br>
the port.  The key to the success will rest with YOU, the subscribers to<br>
this mailing list, and the linux community interested in seeing a port<br>
of the best data base products available to Linux.  Last week I mentioned<br>
that now is the time to come forward and state your intentions.  There was<br>
gravity in that statement, it is now more important than ever.<br>
<p>
Executive Summary:<br>
<p>
   o  Informix have finished their own business case.  A business case <br>
      developed by the committee will not be required from this point <br>
      forward.<br>
<p>
   o  Informix is preparing a port proposal that will be released to<br>
      the public for a response.  This will have pricing and product<br>
      information.  As an interested subscriber, you will be asked to<br>
      respond to this proposal.  <br>
<p>
   o  Informix will be looking to the Linux community and the response<br>
      they get as the final indicator whether or not to port.<br>
<p>
You are the key to this becoming a success.  For those of you out there<br>
that have stayed with this from the beginning, this is probably the most<br>
important time to get involved.  <br>
<p>
I am supporting Carlton fully in this effort, as well as the good people of Informix, and our committee. <br>
<p>
Stay tuned, instructions will be coming shortly,<br>
<p>

# -- Begin Message From Informix --  <br>
#<br>
#<br>
<p>
The following document summarizes the current status of the Linux project<br>
at Informix.<br>
<p>
<p>
Background:<br>
<p>
Many individuals within the Informix user community have been asking for<br>
Informix to port their products to Linux.  Because of the number of<br>
requests, Informix has been doing research in this area to better<br>
understand the requirements as well as the demand so that we could develop<br>
a business case, and justify funding a project to develop a Linux port.<br>
<p>
<p>
Activity:<br>
<p>
The following summarizes the activity that has taken place in this area:<br>
<p>
    1. We've asked Platform Engineering (PE) to estimate the cost of<br>
	building a Linux port.  PE stated that this would be dependent on<br>
	the requirements (i.e., exact product and features, frequency of<br>
	maintenance releases, support requirements, etc.).<br>
<p>
	PE also stated that older versions of OnLine and SE would be much<br>
	easier to port than the 7.x versions of ODS.  This is mainly due<br>
	to the fact that the newer products rely much more on third-party<br>
	products which likely do not have a Linux port.  Therefore, it<br>
	is likely that a Linux port of 7.x products will not include<br>
	INFORMIX-Enterprise Command Center (IECC), a graphical<br>
	administration utility, and the Informix Storage Manager (ISM), a<br>
	backup/restore utility used in conjunction with ON-Bar.  Other<br>
	features that may not be available are still to be determined.<br>
<p>
    2. We developed a questionnaire to better determine customer<br>
	requirements.  The questionnaire was submitted to the Linux<br>
	Advocacy Committee for distribution and summarization.  To date,<br>
	information from only 12 questionnaires has been received back.<br>
	Based on the questionnaires returned, as well as other emails on<br>
	this subject, we've learned the following:<br>
<p>
	     - The target customers for this product are small workgroups<br>
		(10-20 users on average).<br>
	     - Small VARs have biggest interest in Linux port, but some end<br>
		users have also requested the product.<br>
	     - Database sizes are mostly in the 1 to 5 GB range.<br>
	     - Performance requirements vary, but should be comparable to a SCO <br>
		port.<br>
	     - Products most requested are OnLine Workgroup Server (OWS),<br>
		ESQL/C, 4GL, and SE.<br>
	     - Customers would prefer to have a 7.x version with feature<br>
		restrictions rather than OnLine 5.x.<br>
	     - Porting to just one Linux version was acceptable to most<br>
		respondents (Caldera and RedHat were most requested).<br>
	     - Customers are very price sensitive.  Ports must be<br>
		comparably priced to Workgroup databases.<br>
	     - Support requirements varied.  Most felt email support was<br>
		sufficient, but some said 24x7 would ultimately be needed.<br>
	     - Maintenance releases are not needed as often as for other<br>
		ports.  One or two a year were felt to be sufficient. <br>
		Interim releases were felt to be not needed.<br>
	     - Running Informix products developed for SCO in Linux<br>
		compatibility mode was not acceptable.<br>
	     - From the 12 respondents, we still do not have a clear<br>
		picture of the sales estimates for this product.<br>
<p>
    3. We still need a business case in order to justify funding a Linux<br>
	port.  In order to Add a Linux port to our list of projects<br>
	something else would have to drop off, or incremental resources<br>
	would need to be added.  Having received only 12 completed<br>
	questionnaires does not help justify a business case.  Where are<br>
	all the Linux users that have been so active in the email<br>
	discussions and C.D.I?<br>
<p>
	Our next plans are to put together a description of the proposed<br>
	Linux port (product, proposed price, support plans, maintenance<br>
	plans, etc.).  This will be very similar to the above findings,<br>
	and will be passed on to the Linux advocacy group for<br>
	verification, and then on to a wider audience. Users should find<br>
	it easier to respond to this more specific proposal on whether<br>
	they would or would not purchase the proposed product.<br>
<p>
Thank you for your patience.  We really are making progress on this<br>
project.  However, it is definitely not the only thing we are working<br>
on these days.  I understand many of you are frustrated, and at times<br>
feel that Informix is not taking the Linux subject seriously.  Let me<br>
assure you that we are listening and we are taking your requests<br>
seriously, but at the same time we can not drop any other projects<br>
without first having a clear justification.<br>
<p>
Thanks again for your understanding and continued support,<br>
Informix Product Management<br>
