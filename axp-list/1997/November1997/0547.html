<i>&gt; My alpha keep crashing with an </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; all the numbers keep changing.. is there any way to diagnose this problem?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If it helps, I am running 2.0.30 and I just tried to do a backup to tape,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but I've been reading from tape just fine.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This has happened during other times, so I don't think it has to do with</i><br>
<i>&gt; the tape backup.. Would upgrading to 2.0.31 help? How do you do that</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyway?</i><br>
<p>
No solution, but description of a potentially similar problem (BTW, it<br>
would certainly help if you gave some more technical details)<br>
<p>
My machine is a pc164 (500MHz), 128MB RAM, only IDE subsystem.  I have<br>
complained about the last issue a lot, but the bottom line is that<br>
this is my fault.  It makes for a sometimes slow, unresponsive system<br>
that was nevertheless stable (uptime 2 months+) during the last 6<br>
months.  During that uptime the machine was used in heavy duty<br>
numerical simulations, including some disk I/O intensive<br>
post-processing (that's how I truly noticed the shortcomings of the<br>
IDE subsystem).  The machine is running RH 4.2; however, I got a clean<br>
2.0.30 kernel source plus the famous axp-diffs from June (July) that<br>
managed to clean up a lot of problems; this is what I am still<br>
running.<br>
<p>
Since about a week, I can pretty much at will kill the machine<br>
with an "Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address"<br>
when transferring lots of data (ftp of large files, tar to<br>
a remote tape drive, cp via nfs etc.)  It's not fully<br>
reproducable, but after a while the machine dies.  I should add that<br>
increasing /proc/sys/vm/freepages so far did not help at all as far<br>
as I can tell (As I said, the problem is not completely<br>
reproducable, but I have seen a crash with the default values during<br>
e.g. the fifth 60MB file to ftp; rebooted (power off/on, as a<br>
reset leads to even stranger things on this machine), try again<br>
after increasing /proc/sys/vm/freepages by a uniform factor<br>
of 3, and it dies during the fourth file ???  That's why I doubt<br>
that it has to do with these parameters)<br>
<p>
So, the only thing that changed recently is that I brought all<br>
rpms that are of interest to me to the lastest level (update<br>
directory from the local redhat mirror).  Could e.g. the latest<br>
NetKit suddenly cause trouble with the kernel that I use (how<br>
would I go about finding that out...)?  Personally, I am more<br>
worried that I am seeing signs of some developping hardware<br>
problem.<br>
<p>
Nevertheless, has anyone suggestions which kernel + axp-diff (+<br>
possible latest milo?) to try at this point and to see whether<br>
this changes anything.  As I said, the 2.0.30kernel + axp-diffs from<br>
June served me well until a week ago, so I saw no need to try out<br>
the latest new stuff...<br>
<p>
Thanks for suggestions!<br>
<p>
