<i>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; NOW, want something really scarey?</i><br>
<i>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt; In an announcement that has stunned the computer industry, Ken Thompson,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan admitted that the Unix operating </i><br>
<i>&gt; system and C programming language created by them is an elaborate prank </i><br>
<i>&gt; kept alive for over 20 years. Speaking at the recent UnixWorld Software </i><br>
<i>&gt; Development Forum, Thompson revealed the following:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "In 1969, AT&amp;T had just terminated their work with the GE/Honeywell/AT&amp;T</i><br>
<i>&gt; Multics project. Brian and I had started work with an early release of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Pascal from Professor Niklaus Wirth's ETH labs in Switzerland and we</i><br>
<i>&gt; were impressed with its elegant simplicity and power. Dennis had just</i><br>
<i>&gt; finished reading 'Bored of the Rings', a National Lampoon parody of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. As a lark, we decided to do</i><br>
<i>&gt; parodies of the Multics environment and Pascal. Dennis and I were</i><br>
<i>&gt; responsible for the operating environment. We looked at Multics and</i><br>
<i>&gt; designed the new OS to be as complex and cryptic as possible to maximize</i><br>
<i>&gt; casual users' frustration levels, calling it Unix as a parody of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Multics, as well as other more risque allusions. We sold the terse</i><br>
<i>&gt; command language to novitiates by telling them that it saved them</i><br>
<i>&gt; typing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then Dennis and Brian worked on a warped version of Pascal, called 'A'.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'A' looked a lot like Pascal, but elevated the notion of the direct</i><br>
<i>&gt; memory address (which Wirth had banished) to the central concept of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; language. This was Dennis's contribution, and he in fact coined the term </i><br>
<i>&gt; "pointer" as an innocuous sounding name for a truly malevolent</i><br>
<i>&gt; construct.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Brian must be credited with the idea of having absolutely no standard</i><br>
<i>&gt; I/O specification: this ensured that at least 50% of the typical</i><br>
<i>&gt; commercial program would have to be re-coded when changing hardware</i><br>
<i>&gt; platforms. Brian was also responsible for pitching this lack of I/O as a </i><br>
<i>&gt; feature: it allowed us to describe the language as "truly portable".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When we found others were actually creating real programs with A, we</i><br>
<i>&gt; removed compulsory type-checking on function arguments. Later, we added</i><br>
<i>&gt; a notion we called "casting": this allowed the programmer to treat an</i><br>
<i>&gt; integer as though it were a 50kb user-defined structure. When we found</i><br>
<i>&gt; that some programmers were simply not using pointers, we eliminated the</i><br>
<i>&gt; ability to pass structures to functions, enforcing their use in even the </i><br>
<i>&gt; Simplest applications. We sold this, and many other features, as</i><br>
<i>&gt; enhancements to the efficiency of the language. In this way, our prank</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolved into B, BCPL, and finally C. We stopped when we got a clean</i><br>
<i>&gt; compile on the following syntax:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; for (;P("\n"),R-;P("|"))for(e=3DC;e-;P("_"+(*u++/8)%2))P("|"+(*u/4)%2);</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; At one time, we joked about selling this to the Soviets to set their</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer science progress back 20 or more years.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately, AT&amp;T and other US corporations actually began using Unix</i><br>
<i>&gt; and C. We decided we'd better keep mum, assuming it was just a passing</i><br>
<i>&gt; phase. In fact, it's taken US companies over 20 years to develop enough</i><br>
<i>&gt; expertise to generate useful applications using this 1960's</i><br>
<i>&gt; technological parody. We are impressed with the tenacity of the general</i><br>
<i>&gt; Unix and C programmer. In fact, Brian, Dennis and I have never ourselves </i><br>
<i>&gt; attempted to write a commercial application in this environment.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We feel really guilty about the chaos, confusion and truly awesome</i><br>
<i>&gt; programming projects that have resulted from our silly prank so long</i><br>
<i>&gt; ago."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Dennis Ritchie said: "What really tore it (just when ADA was catching</i><br>
<i>&gt; on), was that Bjarne Stroustrup caught onto our joke. He extended it to</i><br>
<i>&gt; further parody, Smalltalk. Like us, he was caught by surprise when</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nobody laughed. So he added multiple inheritance, virtual base classes,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and later ... templates. All to no avail. So we now have compilers that</i><br>
<i>&gt; can compile 100,000 lines per second, but need to process header files</i><br>
<i>&gt; for 25 minutes before they get to the meat of "Hello, World".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Major Unix and C vendors and customers, including AT&amp;T, Microsoft,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Hewlett-Packard, GTE, NCR, and DEC have refused comment at this time.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Borland International, a leading vendor of object-oriented tools,</i><br>
<i>&gt; including the popular Turbo Pascal and Borland C++, stated they had</i><br>
<i>&gt; suspected this for a couple of years. In fact, the notoriously late</i><br>
<i>&gt; Quattro Pro for Windows was originally written in C++. Philippe Kahn</i><br>
<i>&gt; said: "After two and a half years programming, and massive programmer</i><br>
<i>&gt; burn-outs, we re-coded the whole thing in Turbo Pascal in three months.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think it's fair to say that Turbo Pascal saved our bacon". Another</i><br>
<i>&gt; Borland spokesman said that they would continue to enhance their Pascal</i><br>
<i>&gt; products and halt further efforts to develop C/C++.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Professor Wirth of the ETH institute and father of the Pascal, Modula 2</i><br>
<i>&gt; and Oberon structured languages, cryptically said "P.T. Barnum was</i><br>
<i>&gt; right." He had no further comments.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; [see, i told you it was scarey]</i><br>

<i>&gt; (btw) can anyone point me to the 13th missing POSIX list</i><br>
