I'm starting a research position at UGA (Athens, Georgia) in January, and<br>
I've been given $5000 in startup funds for purchasing a workstation to<br>
carry out numerical modelling experiments (climate/ice sheet models,<br>
basically non-linear advection-diffusion equations, in other words heavy<br>
floating point and data flow). I would appreciate any recommendations on<br>
how to put together a high-performance workstation on this budget.<br>
Specifically: <br>
<p>
1) What experience have people had with : Microway, Aspen, and DCG?<br>
Are there any other companies that you would recommend that<br>
actively support Linux?<br>
<p>
2)From posts of the last few days I've come to understand that IDE dma<br>
modes aren't supported on the Alpha chip so that I will likely need<br>
to use a SCSI drive. But would I still be farther ahead going with<br>
IDE and using the money saved to purchase more RAM? (The expandibility<br>
advantage of SCSI's is not important to me, as future expansion would<br>
most likely come in the form of second workstation (assuming I<br>
make it at the grant game)).<br>
<p>
3)Are commercial fortran 77 packages for Linux worth the extra expense<br>
as compared to f2c and gcc? If so, which do you recommend?  Some past<br>
posts indicate that f2c is broken on Alpha Linux. Is this true? As the<br>
primary usage of the workstation will be to compile and run F77 code,<br>
I need to know that there is a stable and efficient fortran compiler<br>
for the Alpha.<br>
<p>
4)How stable is Redhat 4.2 for the Alpha? Or should I wait till 5.0 is<br>
out? And when will that be?<br>
<p>
4.5)My remaining questions about stability have just been posted<br>
by someone else.  Please pass any individual responses to other<br>
posts concerning STABILITY to me as well.<br>
<p>
5) What is the difference between full old-fashioned Workstations, and<br>
these much cheaper Alpha pc workstations? For my budget, is this the best<br>
way to go to get floating point performance?<br>
<p>
6) Any comments on my second draft configuration<br>
(eg SCSI controller to use/avoid, Power supply size,...):<br>
<p>
* 533 MHz 21164(a) Alpha processor<br>
* Mid-Size Tower &amp; 300W PS<br>
* 2 MB static CACHE<br>
* 128 MB SDRAM Upgradable to 256 MB<br>
* Ultra wide SCSI controller<br>
* 4.3 GB SCSI Hard Drive<br>
* 8X CD-ROM<br>
* 3.5" 1.44 MB Floppy<br>
* 2 Serial, 1 Parallel Port<br>
* 10/100 Mb/s Ethernet card<br>
* 101 Enhanced Keyboard<br>
* Logitech 3-Button Mouse<br>
* LINUX (4.2) installed<br>
*17" monitor<br>
*UPS (A power failure at home that crashed a partition on my Pentium<br>
 133 running Linux has taught me the value of having a USP for Linux<br>
 systems)<br>
<p>
Any feedback would be much appreciated.<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
