It will improve... The next revision of Debian is supposed to fully<br>

I think the Linux community is stronger than that, and distribution<br>
via CDROM only would be an incredibly bad marketing and PR move<br>
for RedHat.  Give em more credit for smarts than that.  They stay ahead<br>
of Debian and Slack because of their marketing acumen, not in spite<br>
of it.  If they did that, there would be a radical shift in the market<br>
share of the linux distributions.  After all Debian, for instance is<br>
arguably a comparable if not superior product in some ways.  (And not<br>
in others)<br>
<p>
Now, I do think they are smoking dope if they think they will sell many<br>
RHmember subscriptions at $299.00, that smacks of the Caldera reality<br>
distortion field.  We, my company paid only about $50 more for a full one<br>
year support contract awhile back.  Add it up, Redhat has only had 3 or<br>
fewer revisions in a given year in the past.  Even if you paid full price<br>
for 3 boxed sets + shipping, AND bought a ball cap, AND figured in a 10%<br>
discount on the typical amount of Redhat products you bought in a year,<br>
you would still fall almost $100 short of the $299 membership fee.  What<br>
kind of "deal" is that?  Thats alot of money to pay for the convenience of<br>
getting the dists automatically.  Yes, I know there are other unnamed<br>
perks.  But as you can see this is not gonna be for the 'typical' RedHat<br>
user.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, lest you think I hate RedHat...<br>
I like RedHat and I'm ordering my 5.0 for $50 (like I did for 3.0.3,<br>
4.0, 4.1, and 4.2)  And I've got the Motif 2.0, PowerTools, Library,<br>
Maximum RPM, a couple of ballcaps and a frisbee all bought at Linux<br>
EXPO 97.  So I believe in supporting RedHat, all in all, they have done<br>
excellent things for the Linux community.  Cut them some slack, its<br>
not like they are the Evil Empire.<br>
