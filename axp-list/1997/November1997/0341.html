WARNING, CAUTION, DANGER, AND BEWARE! <br>
Gullibility Virus Spreading over the Internet! <br>
****************************************************************** <br>
<p>
WASHINGTON, D.C.--The Institute for the Investigation of Irregular<br>
Internet Phenomena announced today that many<br>
Internet users are becoming infected by a new virus that causes them to<br>
believe without question every groundless story,<br>
legend, and dire warning that shows up in their inbox or on their<br>
browser. The Gullibility Virus, as it is called, apparently<br>
makes people believe and forward copies of silly hoaxes relating to<br>
cookie recipes, email viruses, taxes on modems, and<br>
get-rich-quick schemes. <br>
<p>
"These are not just readers of tabloids or people who buy lottery<br>
tickets based on fortune cookie numbers," a spokesman<br>
said. "Most are otherwise normal people, who would laugh at the same<br>
stories if told to them by a stranger on a street<br>
corner." However, once these same people become infected with the<br>
Gullibility Virus, they believe anything they read on<br>
the Internet. <br>
<p>
"My immunity to tall tales and bizarre claims is all gone," reported one<br>
weeping victim. "I believe every warning message<br>
and sick child story my friends forward to me, even though most of the<br>
messages are anonymous." <br>
<p>
Another victim, now in remission, added, "When I first heard about Good<br>
Times, I just accepted it without question. After<br>
all, there were dozens of other recipients on the mail header, so I<br>
thought the virus must be true." It was a long time, the<br>
victim said, before she could stand up at a Hoaxees Anonymous meeting<br>
and state, "My name is Jane, and I've been<br>
hoaxed." Now, however, she is spreading the word. "Challenge and check<br>
whatever you read," she says. <br>
<p>
Internet users are urged to examine themselves for symptoms of the<br>
virus, which include the following: <br>
<p>
     the willingness to believe improbable stories without thinking <br>
     the urge to forward multiple copies of such stories to others <br>
     a lack of desire to take three minutes to check to see if a story<br>
is true <br>
<p>
T. C. is an example of someone recently infected. He told one reporter,<br>
"I read on the Net that the major ingredient in<br>
almost all shampoos makes your hair fall out, so I've stopped using<br>
shampoo." When told about the Gullibility Virus, T. C.<br>
said he would stop reading email, so that he would not become infected. <br>
<p>
Anyone with symptoms like these is urged to seek help immediately.<br>
Experts recommend that at the first feelings of<br>
gullibility, Internet users rush to their favorite search engine and<br>
look up the item tempting them to thoughtless credence.<br>
Most hoaxes, legends, and tall tales have been widely discussed and<br>
exposed by the Internet community. <br>
<p>
Courses in critical thinking are also widely available, and there is<br>
online help from many sources, including <br>

<p>
Those people who are still symptom free can help inoculate themselves<br>
against the Gullibility Virus by reading some good<br>
material on evaluating sources, such as <br>

Lastly, as a public service, Internet users can help stamp out the<br>
Gullibility Virus by sending copies of this message to<br>
anyone who forwards them a hoax. <br>
