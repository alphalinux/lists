<p>
Quite correct.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now, I do think they are smoking dope if they think they will sell many</i><br>
<i>&gt; RHmember subscriptions at $299.00, that smacks of the Caldera reality</i><br>
<i>&gt; distortion field.  We, my company paid only about $50 more for a full one</i><br>
<i>&gt; year support contract awhile back.  Add it up, Redhat has only had 3 or</i><br>
<i>&gt; fewer revisions in a given year in the past.  Even if you paid full price</i><br>
<i>&gt; for 3 boxed sets + shipping, AND bought a ball cap, AND figured in a 10%</i><br>
<i>&gt; discount on the typical amount of Redhat products you bought in a year,</i><br>
<i>&gt; you would still fall almost $100 short of the $299 membership fee.  What</i><br>
<i>&gt; kind of "deal" is that?  Thats alot of money to pay for the convenience of</i><br>
<i>&gt; getting the dists automatically.  Yes, I know there are other unnamed</i><br>
<i>&gt; perks.  But as you can see this is not gonna be for the 'typical' RedHat</i><br>
<i>&gt; user.</i><br>
<p>
It'll sell some copies to "corporate" folks that won't cut a P.O. for less <br>
than $250.<br>
<p>
If it results in some companies starting to believe that Linux is for real for <br>
a mere premium of $100, that's OK by me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; On the other hand, lest you think I hate RedHat...</i><br>
<i>&gt; I like RedHat and I'm ordering my 5.0 for $50 (like I did for 3.0.3,</i><br>
<i>&gt; 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2)  And I've got the Motif 2.0, PowerTools, Library,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Maximum RPM, a couple of ballcaps and a frisbee all bought at Linux</i><br>
<i>&gt; EXPO 97.  So I believe in supporting RedHat, all in all, they have done</i><br>
<i>&gt; excellent things for the Linux community.  Cut them some slack, its</i><br>
<i>&gt; not like they are the Evil Empire.</i><br>
<p>
I know a couple of people that really *do* consider RedHat to be an "Evil <br>
Empire" because they charge more than $1.99 per CD.<br>
<p>
And it all flies in the face of the words of RMS himself who suggests that <br>
people selling free software try to charge *AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE* so as to <br>
improve the funding available for producing more free software.  But I digress.<br>
<p>
I'll probably upgrade my Intel system once 5.1 comes out, and get the Alpha <br>
version of 5.0 on the "Library" CDs...<br>
<p>
I guess my speculation on timing was wrong.  I expected Red Hat to wait for <br>
the next release of XFree86 to become available.<br>
<p>
Note that that, and fixes to GLIBC, will probably make for a "natural" 5.1 <br>
release in about February or March...<br>
