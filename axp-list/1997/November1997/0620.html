#&gt; Now, I do think they are smoking dope if they think they will sell many<br>
#&gt; RHmember subscriptions at $299.00, that smacks of the Caldera reality<br>
#&gt; distortion field.  We, my company paid only about $50 more for a full one<br>
#&gt; year support contract awhile back.  Add it up, Redhat has only had 3 or<br>
#&gt; fewer revisions in a given year in the past.  Even if you paid full price<br>
#&gt; for 3 boxed sets + shipping, AND bought a ball cap, AND figured in a 10%<br>
#&gt; discount on the typical amount of Redhat products you bought in a year,<br>
#&gt; you would still fall almost $100 short of the $299 membership fee.  What<br>
#&gt; kind of "deal" is that?  Thats alot of money to pay for the convenience of<br>
#&gt; getting the dists automatically.  Yes, I know there are other unnamed<br>
#&gt; perks.  But as you can see this is not gonna be for the 'typical' RedHat<br>
#&gt; user.<br>
#<br>
#It'll sell some copies to "corporate" folks that won't cut a P.O. for less <br>
#than $250.<br>
#<br>
#If it results in some companies starting to believe that Linux is for real for <br>
#a mere premium of $100, that's OK by me.<br>
#<br>

Not that I want to drag out this thread out another week, but I tried to<br>
throw RedHat a bone a couple weeks ago by ordering this RHmember<br>
subscription and one of everything they sold (~$900). Turns out they<br>
wanted a lot from my company before I was cleared to use P.O.'s, including<br>
provide them with 3 P.O. references and a Nerf Ballzooka. :) <br>
<p>
I was hoping that it would be easier considering I don't work for a<br>
unknown. Mitsubishi Electronics has ~400 people in the area. I am in a<br>
small engineering design center which only issues P.O.'s to 1 or 2 places. <br>
<p>
Our 1997 budget for PC to Solaris connectivity software was $2000.  Well<br>
after a $40 RedHat 4.2 CD we have all our engineers on intel/Linux boxes<br>
that work better for us than any other solution regardless of price.<br>
<p>
We have automatic P.O.'s set up at a local place (plug for Stay-on-Line in<br>
rtp N.C. just a few miles from RedHat's North American headquarters). So I<br>
just picked up some applixware from them. They don't have a full selection<br>
of RedHat toys, yet. But it would be nicer to give RedHat a bigger slice<br>
of the pie.<br>
<p>
RHmember subscriptions don't make sense in most cases. But it would be a<br>
nice way for my company to give RedHat a little payback for providing us<br>
with so much value.<br>

<p>
#&gt; On the other hand, lest you think I hate RedHat...<br>
#&gt; I like RedHat and I'm ordering my 5.0 for $50 (like I did for 3.0.3,<br>
#&gt; 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2)  And I've got the Motif 2.0, PowerTools, Library,<br>
#&gt; Maximum RPM, a couple of ballcaps and a frisbee all bought at Linux<br>
#&gt; EXPO 97.  So I believe in supporting RedHat, all in all, they have done<br>
#&gt; excellent things for the Linux community.  Cut them some slack, its<br>
#&gt; not like they are the Evil Empire.<br>
