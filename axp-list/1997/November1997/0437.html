Just for the record, I have built a working, bootable Linux on an<br>
as255 using SRM console.  This is RH 4.2 installed on /dev/sdb [not<br>
/dev/sda].  Dec UNIX is on /dev/sda.<br>
<p>
This has been derived via trial and error, reading this list, the<br>
howto's and the RH doc [lame as it is].  RH tech support was no help;<br>
they didn't even try to fake wrong answers.<br>
<p>
Here's what I did.  Your mileage may vary.<br>
<p>
0. buy a floppy drive.<br>
<p>
1. Create boot and ramdisk floppies by copying the images in the<br>
IMAGES directory of RH cdrom disk1.  use `avanti-s.img' and<br>
`ramdisk.img'.  [the hint here is that the -s extensions refer to SRM<br>
console.]<br>
<p>
2. Boot the system as follows:<br>
<p>
 a. at the srm prompt:<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;&gt; boot dva1</i><br>
<p>
  This will boot up `aboot' in interactive mode.  You are supposed to<br>
be able to pass parameters to aboot - and you can - but aboot has to<br>
deduce device names and partitions and this does not always work<br>
correctly.  I've found this is more forgiving of spelling mistakes.<br>
<p>
 b. at the aboot prompt, boot the kernel:<br>
  aboot: vmlinux.gz root=/dev/fd0 load_ramdisk=1 prompt_ramdisk=1<br>
<p>
 when prompted, load the ramdisk.<br>
<p>
 this takes you into the RH install.<br>
<p>
3. RH install will use fdisk to partition the disk.  I found that I<br>
could start the first partition a few cylinders in from the start of<br>
the disk.<br>
<p>
Important: write down the cylinder, head, and sector numbers.  I found<br>
it convenient to change the fdisk units to blocks and write down the<br>
fdisk table using raw block numbers.  I needed this because I had to<br>
go back and rebuild the disk label using the BSD compatibility mode of<br>
fdisk in order for `aboot' to be able to find things on the disk.<br>
<p>
Question: it seems to me that you have to have BOTH an fdisk partition<br>
table and a BSD compatible disk label on the disk in order for things<br>
to work correctly.  Does anyone know if this is really true?<br>
<p>
4. Finish the install.<br>
<p>
At the end of the install, you are told to remove the floppy and<br>
reboot the system.  This will not work.<br>
<p>
5. Insert the floppy and boot the installed system using the floppy.<br>
<p>
  a. at the SRM prompt:<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;&gt; boot dva1</i><br>
<p>
  b. at the aboot prompt:<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;&gt; vmlinux.gz root=/dev/sdb1</i><br>
 or wherever you put your system: e.g. /dev/sda1, etc.<br>
<p>
6. Create the BSD disk label.  You do this by typing `fdisk /dev/sdb'<br>
or `fdisk /dev/sda' or whatever.  Go to the BSD compatible section and<br>
create your partitions.  I did it like this:<br>
<p>
 a. changed the cylinder, head, and sectors/track numbers to match the<br>
fdisk numbers I used.<br>
 b. created an `unused' partition for partition `a' which spanned the<br>
disk blocks I omitted from the `fdisk' partition table.<br>
    created a `b' partition which spanned my Linux Native partition<br>
    created a `c' partition which spans the whole disk - kind of a<br>
      tradition<br>
    created a `d' partition which spans my swap space.<br>
  c. wrote the label to disk and exited.<br>
<p>
This clobbers the disk geometry parameters for my `fdisk' partition<br>
table, but it doesn't seem to matter.<br>
<p>
7. Install the aboot package.  When I did it, the RH install did not<br>
install aboot.  So:<br>
  a. mount /mnt/cdrom<br>
  b. cd /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS<br>
  c. rpm -i aboot-0.5-1.axp.rpm<br>
<p>
8. Install aboot using swriteboot:<br>
<p>
Since my system is on /dev/sdb, I wrote:<br>
<p>
 # swriteboot -f1 -f3 -v /dev/sdb /boot/bootlx /vmlinux.gz<br>
<p>
You need the -f's in order to `force' overwriting partitions `a' and<br>
`c'.  The -v is just so you can see the messages.<br>
<p>
9. sync the disks and reboot.<br>
<p>
This time, at the SRM prompt type:<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;&gt;boot dka1</i><br>
<p>
This should boot `aboot'.  At the aboot prompt, I have to type:<br>
  aboot: 0/vmlinux.gz root=/dev/sdb1<br>
<p>
NOTES:<br>
<p>
I installed vmlinux.gz in the boot block because that is the only way<br>
aboot can find it other than on a floppy.  This is because I built an<br>
ABNORMAL system by putting Linux on /dev/sdb.  `aboot' knows about<br>
/dev/sda and is (supposed to be to) able to find vmlinux.gz on a<br>
specified partition - read the aboot doc.  This doesn't work if your<br>
system is not on /dev/sda, however - read the code.<br>
<p>
Similarly, I have to specify where the root partition is every time.<br>
Maybe I'll build a kernel and hack an aboot, and maybe not.<br>
<p>
Hope this helps<br>
