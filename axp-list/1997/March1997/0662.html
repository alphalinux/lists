  Hello All;<br>
<p>
  If there are spelling errors or typos please forgive me, I had left<br>
  shoulder surgery this past Tuesday, and have only one hand to type<br>
  with.<br>
<p>
  Since the accident back in November a youth from church has been<br>
  helping<br>
  me do things in the office in the home. He wanted to learn<br>
  computers, and<br>
  only has a 286 at home to play with. Since he has been helping me<br>
  with typing<br>
  replacing motherboards, replying to e-mail, etc, I was thinking of<br>
  getting<br>
  him a present of a newer machine. He has helped with getting my<br>
  Microway<br>
  433Mhz Alpha box up and running. We had to swap motherboards, first<br>
  one died.<br>
<p>
  Given that I could put a complete system together for around $500.00<br>
<p>
  this looks extremely interesting. I would appreciate some serious<br>
  opinions<br>
  concerning these motherboards. The price is really great but I do<br>
  not want<br>
  to give him one, and learn later that it will only give him trouble.<br>

Don't underestimate the "hidden costs" that can creap up and make a $500<br>
do-it-yourself bargain turn into a $1300 project.  Starting with a cheap<br>
motherboard is one thing.  Buying an acceptable amount of memory (32M<br>
minimum these days, especially for an Alpha), keyboard, mouse, floppy,<br>
CD-ROM, case, power supply, hard disk (SCSI probably for an Alpha which<br>
gets expensive, the CD-ROM may also need to be SCSI)... it can add up.<br>
<p>
Don't get me wrong, piecing together a bargain system can be a kick, but<br>
if money is an issue, proceed with caution.<br>
