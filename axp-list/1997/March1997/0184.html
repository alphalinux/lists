     a)  I found sector/track/#head info on the toshiba on their web site.  <br>
     Maybe what you want is there also.<br>
     <br>
     b)  Why did you want to do this?  My scsi peripherals are in an <br>
     external scsi box with it's own power supply.  I see no reason to do <br>
     it any other way.  If you can put the toshiba in your cdrom case, <br>
     could you not have put the ibm in there?  Then you would have a floppy <br>
     again.<br>

Subject: UDB HD upgrade <br>
Author:  &lt;<a href="mailto:axp-list@redhat.com">axp-list@redhat.com</a>&gt; at INTERNET<br>

On the subject of internal connectors in/on the UDB and for everyone who <br>
wants to install a 'larger' drive:<br>
     <br>
I've succesfully installed an IBM DORS31240  SCSI inside the UDB and <br>
took its power from the mentioned 4 pin connector. The IBM drive takes <br>
minimal power about 300 mA at 5V and 200 mA at 12V.<br>
     <br>
Other than the fan and the serial ports I can't imagine what uses 12 V <br>
in the UDB so the 0.7 Amps (no typo) should just barely do for a 3.5" <br>
drive.<br>
     <br>
I managed to 'squeeze' in the 3.5" drive just below the floppydrive by <br>
modifying the cage a little (cut off the one leg going underneath the <br>
cage) and did some minor enlargments on the holes at the sides so the <br>
mounting screws for the drive would fit in.<br>
With the IBM drive I have about 1 mm of clearance between the drive and <br>
the nearest chips, but since these are all plastic I don't expect <br>
problems from that. (The circuit board of the IBM drive is very small <br>
too) A couple of spacers enlarged the 'gap' to 2 mm without giving <br>
trouble for the floppy drive.<br>
     <br>
Even the PCI slot is still available this way but the card has to <br>
small...<br>
     <br>
Performance is good at rates of over 4 Mb/sec much faster than the 1 <br>
Mb/sec I had from the Toshiba, the drive makes some noise but not as <br>
annoying as the click-pause-clunk of the Toshiba drive.. <br>
     <br>
Only problem so far is the floppy drive, the original cable, a 'foil' <br>
type of cable is too short as it has to go from under the HD behind the <br>
power connector and up to the floppy drive. I also tried to bend it in <br>
45 degree angles to get the cable out from the side but it also ended up <br>
being too short. I haven't found a solution yet for this, most audio and <br>
video equipment use the same type of cabling internally these days but <br>
the spacing is wrong. I've tried to solder to it, no avail, the plastic <br>
layer melts away and you end up with a 'blob' of shortcircuited cable. <br>
If anyone knows a supplier for this type of cabling I'd be interested. <br>
     <br>
I can imagine that most people need the floppy drive to initially <br>
install/boot from.... So I don't recommend this upgrade if you havent <br>
installed the system on the original HD yet..<br>
     <br>
About the UDB supply: according to the power supply specs on the label <br>
it can deliver more than enough power at 5V (7A), the CPU runs from the <br>
3.3 V supply. So I guess two 2.5" drives should be no problem as these <br>
run from 5V only. The 5V drives stay quite cool too so the internal <br>
temperature rise should be minimal. <br>
     <br>
While copying the stuff from the Toshiba to the IBM I had both drives <br>
connected and powered to/from the UDB and had no problems. <br>
     <br>
BTW if anyone knows how to change the ID of the Toshiba drive I'd also <br>
like to know, I had the idea of putting it inside my external CD-ROM <br>
just to have some 'swapping' space. The drive has no visible jumpers <br>
AFAIK. <br>
