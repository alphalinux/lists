On the subject of internal connectors in/on the UDB and for everyone who<br>
wants to install a 'larger' drive:<br>
<p>
I've succesfully installed an IBM DORS31240  SCSI inside the UDB and<br>
took its power from the mentioned 4 pin connector. The IBM drive takes<br>
minimal power about 300 mA at 5V and 200 mA at 12V.<br>
<p>
Other than the fan and the serial ports I can't imagine what uses 12 V<br>
in the UDB so the 0.7 Amps (no typo) should just barely do for a 3.5"<br>
drive.<br>
<p>
I managed to 'squeeze' in the 3.5" drive just below the floppydrive by<br>
modifying the cage a little (cut off the one leg going underneath the<br>
cage) and did some minor enlargments on the holes at the sides so the<br>
mounting screws for the drive would fit in.<br>
With the IBM drive I have about 1 mm of clearance between the drive and<br>
the nearest chips, but since these are all plastic I don't expect<br>
problems from that. (The circuit board of the IBM drive is very small<br>
too) A couple of spacers enlarged the 'gap' to 2 mm without giving<br>
trouble for the floppy drive.<br>
<p>
Even the PCI slot is still available this way but the card has to<br>
small...<br>
<p>
Performance is good at rates of over 4 Mb/sec much faster than the 1<br>
Mb/sec I had from the Toshiba, the drive makes some noise but not as<br>
annoying as the click-pause-clunk of the Toshiba drive.. <br>
<p>
Only problem so far is the floppy drive, the original cable, a 'foil'<br>
type of cable is too short as it has to go from under the HD behind the<br>
power connector and up to the floppy drive. I also tried to bend it in<br>
45 degree angles to get the cable out from the side but it also ended up<br>
being too short. I haven't found a solution yet for this, most audio and<br>
video equipment use the same type of cabling internally these days but<br>
the spacing is wrong. I've tried to solder to it, no avail, the plastic<br>
layer melts away and you end up with a 'blob' of shortcircuited cable.<br>
If anyone knows a supplier for this type of cabling I'd be interested. <br>
<p>
I can imagine that most people need the floppy drive to initially<br>
install/boot from.... So I don't recommend this upgrade if you havent<br>
installed the system on the original HD yet..<br>
<p>
About the UDB supply: according to the power supply specs on the label<br>
it can deliver more than enough power at 5V (7A), the CPU runs from the<br>
3.3 V supply. So I guess two 2.5" drives should be no problem as these<br>
run from 5V only. The 5V drives stay quite cool too so the internal<br>
temperature rise should be minimal. <br>
<p>
While copying the stuff from the Toshiba to the IBM I had both drives<br>
connected and powered to/from the UDB and had no problems. <br>
<p>
BTW if anyone knows how to change the ID of the Toshiba drive I'd also<br>
like to know, I had the idea of putting it inside my external CD-ROM<br>
just to have some 'swapping' space. The drive has no visible jumpers<br>
AFAIK. <br>
