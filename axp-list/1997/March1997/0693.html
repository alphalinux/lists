Hello all,<br>
<p>
I am sorry it has taken me so long to respond to the feedback I received in<br>
response to my last post where I compared the code produced by cc and gcc on<br>
the alpha.  My father passed away the morning after I posted it, and I spent<br>
the rest of the week in Wilmington, NC with my mother.<br>
<p>
Since my last message I have learned several important things from postings<br>
to axp-list, which I would like to comment on here.  If you dont remember<br>
my original message, take a look at:<br>
<p>
	    <a href="http://www.acs.uncwil.edu/~jlnance/mmul/index.html">http://www.acs.uncwil.edu/~jlnance/mmul/index.html</a><br>
<p>
1) gcc does not do loop unrolling without the -funroll-loops flag<br>
<p>
When I learned this I assumed that this was at the root of my problems,<br>
especially after someone else reported that the 4x4 case ran 4 times<br>
faster with the -funroll-loops flag on a PPro processor.  Unfortunately,<br>
while the -funroll-loops flag helps, it does not help a lot, certainly<br>
not enough to make it competitive with cc.  Given that it helps so much<br>
on the PPro, it seems like an alpha specific problem.  Does the PPro do<br>
out of order instruction execution?<br>
<p>
2) The 4x4 case runs much faster if the sum is accumulated into a temporary<br>
   variable.<br>
<p>
For a more complete description of this see:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/support/mailing-lists/archives/axp-list/1997-March/0588.html">http://www.redhat.com/support/mailing-lists/archives/axp-list/1997-March/0588.html</a><br>
<p>
To me this seems like another optimizer problem.  When I wrote the code I<br>
put the temporary 4x4 matrices on the stack so that the compiler would know<br>
that it could optimize them w/o having to worry about any aliasing problems<br>
or things like that.  If accumulating the sum into a temporary variable will<br>
speed things up, I would expect the compiler to figure this out and do it.<br>
<p>
3) It seems that my method of timing things was non-portable.<br>
<p>
I have rewritten my program to use gettimeofday(), which is hopefully more<br>
portable.  Someone also requested run times for smaller matrices that would<br>
fit inside a 1M cache.  Here are the new results.  These were run under<br>
Digital Unix on an AlphaStation 500/500 (8M cache) running Digital Unix 4.0.<br>
The binaries are statically linked, so they should run under any version<br>
of Linux/Alpha that has a.out support.  The binaries were compiled as:<br>
<p>
cc -non_shared -newc -std1 -fast simple.c -o mmul.cc<br>
gcc -static -funroll-loops -O3 simple.c -o mmul.gccO3<br>
<p>
Time to square 1000x1000 matrix 2 times:<br>
cc	136.883789    44.124023    50.171875 <br>
gcc	185.990235    52.113281   104.900391<br>
<p>
Time to square 400x400 matrix 3 times:<br>
cc	 8.157226     2.879883     4.245118 <br>
gcc	11.041015     3.520508     9.496093<br>
<p>
Time to square 200x200 matrix 24 times:<br>
cc	5.155273     2.146484     3.970704 <br>
gcc	7.411132     2.407227     9.121094<br>
<p>
Again, I am supplying this data not because I want to complain about gcc,<br>
which I have in general found to be an excellent program, but because this<br>
test program is simple enough that it may be useful for people interested<br>
in optimizing gcc.  If you are interested in getting the new source or<br>
precompiled binaries, take a look at <br>
