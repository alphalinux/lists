*sigh*<br>
<p>
As reported earlier by someone, I now have a reproducable way to make<br>
my alpha kill our entire ethernet.<br>
<p>
I just upgraded my alpha (UDB/Multia/linux 2.0.18). <br>
It was running 4.1, and I've ftped anbd rpm'ed everything from the <br>
updates directory. To my great disappointment, this has only made <br>
matters worse :(<br>
<p>
1)... reboot/halt/init 6 doesn't work anymore. It claims to do <br>
      reboot or shutdown, but never does. You can only turn off the<br>
      machine, resulting in filesystem errors :(<br>
2)... turning on the networking still doesn't work as expected. The<br>
      ethernet gets configured as 0.0.0.0. No routes are configured.<br>
3)... When I set the eth0 (class C network, with default router<br>
      on the eth0 segment) manually it works, however when I start<br>
      anything that results in a namelookup, i can see the LED of our<br>
      router go berserk, and the entire network gets overloaded. <br>
      I can't even run tcpdump on the remote (nameserver) host anymore,<br>
      because it cannot handle the truckload of packets. (Or the packets<br>
      are corrupt).<br>
4)... When I removed the ethernet (BNC) connector to safe our office<br>
      network, and typed 'sync' on the alpha, it locked up solid.<br>
      This is probably due to having my external scsi cabinet at<br>
      home, and having two moint points listed in /etc/fstab. (ie:<br>
      /dev/sdb[12] isn't there while it is in the fstab).<br>
5)... killall -9 amd doesn't even nuke amd when it's running.<br>
6)... There is no modutils package installed. This might have been<br>
      stupidity from my site by forgetting to install the rpm containing<br>
      it. But without these, you cannot build a kernel.<br>
<p>
If RedHat 4.0 was still on the mirror sites, I'd probably install it<br>
instead of 4.1. 4.1 is really not stable for me at all. At least with<br>
4.0 I just had a few scsi kernel panics :(<br>
<p>
Has anyone found out the problems here? Is it just a matter of<br>
nuking amd? I've heard people blame amd for lots of networking problems,<br>
but is that relaly the culprit?<br>
