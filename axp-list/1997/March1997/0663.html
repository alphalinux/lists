Subject: Failure to login after kernel recompile.<br>
<p>
I sent a message to the list last night, but I didn't receive my cc:, so I<br>
am assuming it did not propogate, so I'm going to go ahead and re-send.<br>

I was trying to compile PVM 3.3.11 on a pure vanilla RH4.0 installation on
my 166UDB.  Needless to say it did not work, although I had heard that on
a 2.0.28 kernel it had compiled with little or no trouble.  So, I get the
kernel sources to 2.0.28, and they don't want to compile either.  I even
try to recompile the original 2.0.18 kernel and even THAT doesn't work.
<p>
So, I get the new GLIBC rpms, specifically:
<p>
glibc-0.961212-4.alpha.rpm
glibc-devel-0.961212-3.alpha.rpm
<p>
along with the new rpm (rpm-2.3-1).  I get those installed fine and decide
that it is time to try to compile 2.0.28 again.  Voila, it works like a
champ.  So, I try to boot the 2.0.28 kernel and I get the infamous hang
at:
<p>
eth0: media is TP
<p>
After reading through some of my old saved messages from the list, I
discover that it's a problem with /etc/nsswitch.conf (most likely).  I
edit my /etc/nsswitch.conf file (from single user mode on the 2.0.28
kernel) and try a 'telinit 3'.  It churns merrily along and starts all the
services as normal and I finally get to the regular login screen.  At the
login prompt, no matter which userid I use (root, my id, etc) I get a
login error.  I can't login in multiuser mode AT ALL, as anybody.
<p>
I'm not running shadow passwords (atleast I shouldn't, I don't have an
/etc/shadow anywere), if that is a help.
<p>
I can boot into single user mode just fine on the 2.0.28 kernel, and
actually got PVM to compile just fine.  I can get all my services running 
in single user mode, so I can get new rpms if that is needed.  I would
just like to be able to login in multiuser mode.
<p>
I also should add that I have the same problem with the old kernel as well
now.
<p>
Is there a fix that doesn't involve reinstalling everything?
<p>
Many thanks in advance,
<p>
Brian
