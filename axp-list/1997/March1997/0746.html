<p>
 I've been running 4.1 on my UDB for almost two weeks now (hectic work<br>
schedule kept me from doing it when I received the CD) and I haven't had<br>
any problems, 'cept for xplaycd and it's brethern seg faulting. I'm not<br>
running amd, but I am using NFS mounted filesystems.<br>
<p>
 When 4.1 was released and everybody started having tons of problems,<br>
it startled me to say the least. After watching this list for a few days<br>
it became obvious that amd was indeed causing much heartburn. So, when<br>
I tried to upgrade 4.0 to 4.1, I made a note to stay away from amd. Of<br>
course, when the upgrade got to the MAKEDEV package it promptly hosed<br>
the install, so I just wiped the machine and did a clean install. Most<br>
everything has been working great.<br>
<p>
 I know that this doesn't really help, but I'd suggest trying things<br>
without amd to see if they make a difference.<br>
