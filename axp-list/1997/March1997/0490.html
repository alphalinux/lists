<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; "Whats the difference between parallel, and simultaneously? "</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I have seen this before, with no apparent distinction being made!</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; In the context I was referring to, I used the terms interchangably.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Specifically, with regard to the EV5 chip, during the same clock cycle. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; propably should have been clearer in these days of true multi-processing,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; multi-tasking, multi-threading, (and I am not sure how to describe multiple</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; fibres :-)</i><br>
<i>&gt; I was hopeing for an explanation utilizeing the concept of instruction</i><br>
<i>&gt; pipelines. Parallel implies 2 or more pipelines, simultaneously might</i><br>
<i>&gt; imply 4 mach ins being decoded at various stages of instruction</i><br>
<i>&gt; execution. I'm looking for info/facts -</i><br>
<p>
There are two major types of ways of handling "parallel" or "simultaneous"<br>
instructions that I can think of off the top of my head, and I've never<br>
heard the terms used in any way but interchangeably.<br>
<p>
The two are superscalar and VLIW.  Just about every processor you would<br>
buy today is superscalar, which means that instruction parallelism is <br>
handled at run time by the processor doing dependency checks between<br>
two (or more) instructions and determining whether or not they can be<br>
executed at the same time, and whether there are sufficient resources<br>
available (ie, execution units) to do it.  In some processors, like the<br>
Pentium (R) Processor, the execution units are not equal, so two<br>
instructions without dependencies may not be able to be executed<br>
simultaneously (or in parallel).  In out of order processors like the <br>
R10000 and the Pentium (R) Pro Processor, instructions without<br>
dependencies can pass other instructions if there are free execution<br>
units.<br>
<p>
In VLIW, ILP (instructin level parallelism) is determined at compile<br>
time, and "opcodes" are actually two opcodes concatenated together.<br>
This increases the complexity of the compiler, but removes all of the<br>
dependency checking from the processor.  I don't know of any current<br>
commercial processors using this off of the top of my head, but <br>
companies like Multiflow tried really hard at this a while back.<br>
<p>
The EV4 and EV45 (to my knowledge) are superscalar dual issue <br>
processors, and the EV5 is quad issue, meaning two or four instructions<br>
can be sent to execution if they are independent.  The Pentium Processor<br>
would be dual issue, and the Pentium Pro can be up to 3 issue<br>
(sorta 4, its doing conversion to microops, and the number of microops<br>
per instruction varies by quite a bit).<br>
<p>
At least, to the best of my knowledge.  More information on the Alpha<br>
is available at: <a href="http://www.azstarnet.com/~axplinux/alpha-sys-3.html">http://www.azstarnet.com/~axplinux/alpha-sys-3.html</a><br>
