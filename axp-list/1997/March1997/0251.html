<p>
I have gotten both an 4MB ATI Graphics Pro Turbo card, and a 4MB Matrox<br>
Millinium PowerDoc card to fit in the UDB. The Matrox card is a bit longer<br>
(by a few mm) than the ATI so a bit more manipulation has to be done to<br>
get it to fit, and the screws for your floppy drive can't be screwed in<br>
all the way, just the first few threads. As someone else said, the ribbon<br>
cable for the floppy drive is kind of in the way, but everything works<br>
fine without bending it so much you damage it. <br>
<p>
And maybe a even more important question: Do they work? The Matrox card<br>
did not work. I tried so many different things to get it to work, but it<br>
just wouldn't... first of all it took about 2 minutes for the ARC console<br>
to come up, but it did come up just fine. Right when I told it to Boot<br>
Linux it loaded milo, but after that the screen froze. The system<br>
continued to boot just fine though, but the display didn't work. I tried<br>
all kinds of versions of milo and nothing worked. Once the system booted I<br>
telneted into it from a remote machine and set my display variable to :0.0<br>
and ran startx (Of cource using the SVGA server). I ran up stairs and the<br>
screen was now blank. I went back to the remote machine and nothing worked<br>
on the alpha. I couldn't even ping it.. so, simply, the Matrox card does<br>
not work in the UDB. <br>
<p>
The ATI card, on the other hand, works great. The system boots up just<br>
fine, just as fast as if there were no card in there. Of course you have<br>
to compile VGA support into your kernel, and NOT compile TGA into it, also<br>
grab the latest milo (2.0.28), it's the only one that worked for me. The<br>
only problem is I can't run X in 1280x1024 in 24 bit mode. It simply wont<br>
work. In fact, 1024x768 doesn't even work in 24 bit mode... just 800x600.<br>
So anyway, I'm running it at 1280x1024 in 16 bit mode at 76Hz just fine.<br>
When you do startx though, it defaults to 8 bit mode, which sucks. So I<br>
have to do startx -- -bpp 16 when I start it.. but big deal. <br>
<p>
It kind of sucks that the Matrox card doesn't work though because I would<br>
rather use it. It can take advantage of the higher refresh rates that my<br>
monitor is capable of. But certainly the ATI is much nicer than any 8 bit<br>
color..<br>
