<i>&gt; Hello;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Here is my game plan to upgrade the PC164 to RedHat 4.1.</i><br>
<i>&gt; BTW, I have no idea what version of RedHat this box is currently</i><br>
<i>&gt; running. It is whatever Microway pre-installed on it.</i><br>
<p>
Our machine from Microway was running god-knows-what also.  It was<br>
hanging at random when it arrived, so we installed 4.1 over it.<br>
It was still hanging even after the install, but that may have<br>
been because we were still using the old kernel.  Finally, I<br>
compiled kernel 2.0.27 myself and am using milo2.0.27 from the net.<br>
The machine seems stable now.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Option 1: Manually install RedHat 4.1 to a separate disk partition.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually build a shell script using only the latest files from</i><br>
<i>&gt; RedHat. Advantage here being that my original install remains</i><br>
<i>&gt; intact and I am able to go back to it if need be.</i><br>
<p>
This should be sufficient.  Just make sure you keep your partitions<br>
straight and make sure milo knows which partition to boot off of.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Option 2: Get a third harddrive, and copy the original Linux disk</i><br>
<i>&gt; to this third harddrive. Disconnect the original harddrive to ensure</i><br>
<i>&gt; that nothing will happen to it. Upgrade the copy. </i><br>
<p>
This seems like overkill, but is better than:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Option 3: Backup the original harddrive to DAT, and hope and pray that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the if the upgrade fails, it will be usable enough to recover everything</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the backup tape.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Would anyone out there have any other suggestions?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Has anyone ever manually upgraded a previous installation of Linux to</i><br>
<i>&gt; RedHat 4.1 before?</i><br>
<p>
Yes.  I didn't do it myself, my colleague did.  He simply had 4.1<br>
install itself over the existing OS, but he wasn't careful enough<br>
about telling milo to use the newest kernel.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The reason I am hesitant to just upgrade and hope for the best, is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; at the moment I am doing this literally single handed, the left shoulder</i><br>
<p>
We (or actually my colleague) just upgraded and hoped for the best.<br>
The machine didn't work out until I finally compiled kernel 2.0.27,<br>
and was using milo 2.0.27 with it.  (It would randomly hang<br>
before that unacceptably often.)<br>
