pete,<br>
<p>
Having returned from my holiday I now have time to run your test to<br>
completion. However, I understand the FP-exception still occurs. I'll leave<br>
the debugging to other people (you ?), but let me know when a correct<br>
version of PoVRay is available. BTW, this was sent to the axp-kernel-list,<br>
by Richard Henderson:<br>
<p>
&lt;START of QUOTE&gt;<br>
<p>
There are two problems that showed their head while running<br>
one of the recently added libc math tests.<br>
<p>
  (1) We fail because libm was built without -mieee, and so don't<br>
      pass muster on "regular" denormals and infinities.<br>
<p>
  (2) We fail because the EV5 has no switch to turn 0/0 into either<br>
      a software completion or a native NaN, and so the kernel <br>
      always sends SIGFPE.<br>
<p>
the later is, imo, a kernel bug -- when we get an exception we<br>
should run it through the kernel's ieee_get_fp_control and see if<br>
it really applies.<br>
<p>
For the former, I wonder if -mieee shouldn't be the default, with<br>
the option to turn it off when you _know_ it isn't needed.  Isn't<br>
this the better way to go, with the fewer surprises?<br>
<p>
Opinions from those that actually do math for a living?<br>
<p>
&lt;END of QUOTE&gt;<br>
<p>
Could item (2) possibly be related to our problem ?<br>
<p>
For now, what I can do is render the picture at the largest size possible<br>
without running into this problem, to get at least a fair comparison<br>
between the Pentium and the Alpha. Right now I started one at 640x480 on<br>
the Alpha. When it succeeds I'll try the same on the Pentium.<br>
<p>
Memory used is less now (35M rather than 48M), probably due to the fact<br>
that I started it on a freshly booted machine. I may also try the same test<br>
with less memory (16M, like yours), and see what happens.<br>
<p>
Some of the results submitted by others also seem to indicate that not only<br>
memory size is an issue, but also memory bandwith. If that is so, you will<br>
probably not want to buy one of the lower end Alpha's: memory bandwith is<br>
known to be the weak point of the UDB.<br>
This suggests another variation. Is there anyone out there with a PC164,<br>
366MHz and 8 SIMM's installed, who would be willing to run the same test ?<br>
(On the PC164, the data path between the L3 cache and main memory is as<br>
wide as the number of SIMM's: 128 bits with four (like mine), 256 bits with<br>
eight.)<br>
<p>
Groeten,<br>
Geerten.<br>
<p>
PS: I'm glad that you're still interested in Alpha, despite my previous mail.<br>
