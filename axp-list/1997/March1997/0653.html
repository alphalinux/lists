Hello All;<br>
<p>
If there are spelling errors or typos please forgive me, I had left<br>
shoulder surgery this past Tuesday, and have only one hand to type with.<br>
<p>
Since the accident back in November a youth from church has been helping<br>
me do things in the office in the home. He wanted to learn computers, and<br>
only has a 286 at home to play with. Since he has been helping me with typing<br>
replacing motherboards, replying to e-mail, etc, I was thinking of getting<br>
him a present of a newer machine. He has helped with getting my Microway<br>
433Mhz Alpha box up and running. We had to swap motherboards, first one died.<br>
<p>
Given that I could put a complete system together for around $500.00<br>
this looks extremely interesting. I would appreciate some serious opinions<br>
concerning these motherboards. The price is really great but I do not want<br>
to give him one, and learn later that it will only give him trouble.<br>
<p>
