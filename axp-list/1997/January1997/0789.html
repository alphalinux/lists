Until I started upgrading my UDB from 3.0.3 to 4.0 today, I had a<br>
functioning system (isn't that right Brian?).<br>
<p>
A bit of background to set the scene.<br>
<p>
I have the 2 CD-ROM 4.0 Alpha Linux set from Redhat and started the upgrade<br>
today.  Made the linload and milo disk.  Milo was copied from the CD-ROM. <br>
Used rawrite to copy \images\noname.img and \images\ramdisk.img to two<br>
diskettes.  Then I shutdown my operational 3.0.3 system.<br>
<p>
I rebooted the system, got to the console and changed the boot option from<br>
the hard disk to a floppy.  Rebooted from the floppy and got to the RedHat<br>
installation prompts that ask me if i have a color monitor and from what<br>
media I want to install, and whether I want to upgrade from 3.0.3 or do a<br>
fresh install.  I chose to do an upgrade from a local CD-ROM and started the<br>
installation process.  For the next half hour, various files were copied<br>
from the CD-ROM onto my HD.  Once all of the files were copied i got a<br>
message like (don't recall it EXACTLY and can't back to it!) "put your boot<br>
floppy in and press return."  Did it and for about an hour waited.  Nothing<br>
happened and all I had was a blue screen with a bit of verbage at the top<br>
and bottom of the page.  <br>
<p>
Not a big deal, I thought, I'll just start over with Milo from the floppy<br>
and do a fresh install vice the upgrade.  Wrong!<br>
<p>
Here is the problem as it currently stands.<br>
<p>
I get to the console and boot from the floppy.  Tells me this Milo is built<br>
for 2.0.18.  I quess this is correct.  I'm assuming Redhat put compatible<br>
Milo and Kernels on the CD-ROM. At the milo prompt, I place the boot floppy<br>
in and boot it.  Milo responds with VFS: Disk change detected on device 2/0<br>
and loads the noname.img (I get the ###'s and various info about hardware,<br>
etc.).<br>
<p>
Next i get the prompt<br>
VFS: insert root floppy and press enter.<br>
<p>
I do this and a) get a kernel unaligned trap error message (can post if<br>
needed), b) get a transaction block size=512 message and then<br>
c) Kernel panic:VFS:unable to mount root fs on 02:00<br>
<p>
at that point, everything is frozen and I have to cycle the power.  <br>
This whole process has happened at least 5 times - I can't get any farther.<br>
<p>
I've re-rawritten the noname.img and ramdisk.img several times to no avail.<br>
<p>
Now, not only do I not have my 3.0.3, I can't even get past the floppies to<br>
do another install.<br>
<p>
Suffice it to say I would appreciate ANY help.<br>
<p>
<p>
TIA<br>
