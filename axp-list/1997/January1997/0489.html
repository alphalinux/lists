<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes I 100% agree with the point that conversion from pointer to interger</i><br>
<i>&gt; will lose half value of pointer and we should not write any code that way. </i><br>
<i>&gt; BUT this is a general rule that applies to normal circumstance. I believe a</i><br>
<i>&gt; rule can be bent under special/different circumstances.</i><br>
<p>
Possibly.  But you have to investigate that "special circumstances"<br>
do apply and that this propagate correctly through all your code.<br>
I have seen too many broken programs because of that to believe that<br>
this is easy (people who programmed on Atari ST or Amiga, where<br>
sizeof(int) *could* have been 2 and sizeof(void *) was usually 4,<br>
collected quite a bit of battle scars because of that - especially<br>
when porting a code of "all the world is VAX" type).  Another "nice"<br>
thing was a use of int where sizeof_t was really meant.<br>
<p>
With more complicated source it is often easier to fix buggy code<br>
(yes, these are definite bugs) then trying later to hunt down results<br>
in a debugger.  Shared libraries make hunts even more interesting. :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; need to worry about them.  one of the code that got warning message is:</i><br>
<i>&gt;     int offset = (int)cmd-&gt;info;</i><br>
<i>&gt; And I don't see any problem with that line unless there is something I</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't know.</i><br>
<p>
That exactly what you do not know may come back later and get you. :-)<br>
<p>
This particular case indeed looks like that it **may** be safe. In<br>
particular if a cast was in original sources.  But this depends how later<br>
'offset' is used and from what.  If values stored there indeed will always<br>
fit into an int then you are OK.  But if an original programmer decided<br>
that s/he may later recover an address from 'offset', because everybody<br>
"knows" that sizeof(int) == sizeof(void *), then you are a goner.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; also another warning is about an integer been passed into a function then</i><br>
<i>&gt; the function passed this integer as pointer into another function. there</i><br>
<i>&gt; should not be any problem later if the pointer is converted to interger.</i><br>
<p>
This is more "iffy" case.  If your function expected pointer, there is<br>
no prototype which would force a conversion, and you passed an int,<br>
then you pushed four bytes on an argument stack and grabbed eight.<br>
Now, if there were no other arguments which would become misaligned,<br>
and if you really needed only four bytes of information, and your<br>
code discarded a garbage and not significant bytes, then you will get<br>
away with this (or maybe you will only see later "unaligned access"<br>
wailings).  Otherwise effects are too familiar. :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Other warnings are simliar to the cases I just showed above.</i><br>
<p>
It may be that conversions are harmless in some particular case.<br>
But proving that for non-trivial programs is much harder than it looks.<br>
<p>
Another "interesting" gotcha is to access a pointer or long through<br>
a pointer to int.  Unfortunately your compiler may be silent on this<br>
one.<br>
<p>
The whole point is that if somebody asks "can I safely disregard<br>
compiler warnings about type conversions" then a general answer is NO.<br>
