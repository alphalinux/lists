Well, I thought that after all the good advice I got on this list I<br>
would be home free with the upgrade to redhat 4.0 on my machine.<br>
Needless to say, foolish me!  I am really annoyed.<br>
<p>
The situation is as follows:  I finally had a working machine with<br>
a kernel (2.0.23) that supported my hardware (AHA2940UW), network<br>
properly working, etc.  The machine was flaky, sometimes panicking on<br>
the scsi controller, and I couldn't use the serial ports (builtin on<br>
a pc164), so "foolish me! ! !" I made boot floppies and took the plunge<br>
to upgrade.  It all seemed to go smoothly until reboot time, when I got<br>
a message:<br>
/lib/modules/st.mod: No such file or directory<br>
.<br>
.<br>
INIT: Entering runlevel:3<br>
eth0: media is BNC<br>
<p>
and the machine was stuck for some 5 or 10 minutes.  I thought it was<br>
locked for good, so I repeated the install, this time making it a "clean"<br>
install (not an upgrade), and the same thing.  Eventually it timed out,<br>
but it took about 15 minutes, and kept getting stuck when initializing<br>
almost every service (at least those that had to do with networking<br>
(rpc.mountd, rpc.nfsd, sendmail, smbd), and I am still waiting for it <br>
to finish booting...<br>
<p>
I did not have these problems when upgrading my pentium box...<br>
<p>
Also, I could not use the "stock" boot images from the redhat disk<br>
(yes, I am registered and all, but redhat is on holiday...) because<br>
they do not support my scsi controller, so I am using the boot disk<br>
I made with a recompiled kernel with the proper devices included.<br>
<p>
Does anybody have a "simple" pared down kernel image containing drivers<br>
for the AHA2940UW that I could use to see if this thing boots without<br>
wanting to do so much stuff?  I guess I could also install a super basic<br>
system, with no networking or anything like that - I would have long<br>
finished that test...<br>
<p>
And this machine doesn't seem to want to continue booting (still stuck at<br>
smbd, after 20 minutes or so)  -  hey! now it is trying nmbd!<br>
<p>
Well, some way of telling one's boss about how much work we did during the<br>
Christmas break.  Nobody will believe me that I have been at this for about<br>
4 days straight (and fortunately I found this mailing list!).<br>
<p>
Any comments/suggestions would be appreciated.<br>
<p>
Happy new year!<br>
<p>
Daniel<br>
