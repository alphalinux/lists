Forgot one of the main points I wanted to make in my last post:<br>
When I got the Enorex I went through my normal new harware ritual of<br>
opening it up to see what was inside.  Unfortunately, I found that the<br>
front fan was not hooked up to the power supply, and the scsi cable was<br>
*just* about to fall off the CD-ROM drive.  That, unfortunately, doesn't<br>
say too much for Enorex's quality control.  I'm guessing those guys<br>
can't make these things fast enough, so they're not getting the checking<br>
they should be, but I might be wrong.<br>
<p>
Also, when I first had the machine up running NT(oooh..the fun part<br>
comes to see if I can dual boot this guy later this week...) a few times<br>
when the machine was idlely sitting there running an OpenGL screen<br>
saver, I'd suddenly hear this loud POPWHACK and the monitor(MAG 17") <br>
would go blank...power monitor off and back on, it'd work ok.  Called up<br>
Enorexs sales line to get a number for their tech support, lady was nice<br>
enough to deal with my problem there and have a techie call me back.<br>
Looks like the Matrox card was overdriving the monitor, which was<br>
shutting down as a result.<br>
Got the beast running X almost painlessly once I got the SVGA-test<br>
server, then realized all my ssh connections had died...looks like there<br>
might be a conflict between the matrox and the 3com.<br>
Anyways, I'm beginning to blab on and on, so I'm going to go to sleep.  ;)<br>
<p>
one last note: recompiled povray with some fp switches turned on for<br>
gcc, got the raytrace time for the previously mentioned frame down to 86<br>
seconds, a bit more like what I wanted to see. :)<br>
