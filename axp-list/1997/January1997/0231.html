Aggressive Digital Pricing Dramatically Increases Affordability<br>
of Alpha Computer Line<br>
<p>
Workstation and Server Prices Reduced Up To 42 and 47 Percent,<br>
Respectively<br>
<p>
New Server Configurations Quadruple Memory Capacity at Minimal Cost <br>
<p>
MAYNARD, Mass., Jan. 9 /PRNewswire/ -- Digital Equipment Corp today<br>
reduced prices by as much as 47<br>
percent on its industry- leading 64-bit AlphaServer systems, 42 percent<br>
on its powerful AlphaStation<br>
workstations, and 55 percent on memory options. The pricing reflects<br>
intensified competitive positioning<br>
for DIGITAL's workstation products, and volume manufacturing and<br>
lower-priced memory for its<br>
AlphaServer line. <br>
<p>
DIGITAL also introduced new base-level server configurations that<br>
provide as much as four times the<br>
memory of current systems at little or no extra cost. <br>
<p>
"Today's aggressive price reductions and new base-level system<br>
configurations enable even more<br>
customers in a broader range of markets to leverage the breakthrough<br>
performance and<br>
price/performance advantages of the Alpha platform," said Harry<br>
Copperman, vice president and general<br>
manager, Systems Business Unit. "They will benefit from the power of<br>
complete 64-bit solutions that<br>
include very-large-memory (VLM) capability, exceptional scalability, and<br>
protection from costly<br>
migration." Pricing highlights include: <br>
<p>
-- Midrange AlphaServer 4000 5/300 system (used for line-of-business, <br>
<p>
Internet/intranet, LAN, and departmental applications) now priced at <br>
<p>
$31,500 with 512 MB of memory, a 47 percent savings. System has <br>
<p>
capacity for two 300 MHz Alpha processors and up to 4 GB of 64-bit <br>
<p>
VLM64. Similar savings now available on the higher-capacity <br>
<p>
AlphaServer 4000 5/400 and 4100 systems. <br>
<p>
-- AlphaServer 8200 5/440 system reduced 20 percent to $224,400 with 2<br>
GB <br>
<p>
memory. Similarly, flagship AlphaServer 8400 5/440 system is now <br>
<p>
$344,400 with 2 GB memory, a 14 percent reduction. <br>
<p>
-- Pricing for low-end AlphaServer 1000A 5/333 with 256 MB memory<br>
reduced <br>
<p>
12 percent to $13,945. <br>
<p>
-- DIGITAL memory now available for as little as $19/megabyte, making it <br>
<p>
among the most aggressively priced memory in the industry. AlphaServer <br>
<p>
systems are now configured with up to four times previous memory at <br>
<p>
little or no increase in price. <br>
<p>
-- AlphaStation 600/333, with DIGITAL UNIX, 128 MB memory, 2 GB disk, <br>
<p>
21-inch monitor, and PowerStorm 4D40T graphics, priced at $24,995, a <br>
<p>
savings of 42 percent. <br>
<p>
-- AlphaStation 500/500, the world's fastest desktop workstation, with <br>
<p>
DIGITAL UNIX, 128 MB memory, 2 GB disk, 21-inch monitor, and PowerStorm <br>
<p>
4D40T graphics, reduced 20 percent to $39,995. <br>
<p>
-- AlphaStation 500/333, with DIGITAL UNIX, 128 MB memory, 2 GB disk,<br>
21- <br>
<p>
inch monitor, and PowerStorm 4D40T graphics, now priced 20 percent <br>
<p>
lower at $21,995. <br>
<p>
-- Entry-level AlphaStation 255/300 workstation, with DIGITAL UNIX, 64<br>
MB <br>
<p>
memory, 1 GB disk, 17-inch monitor, and entry-level graphics, now <br>
<p>
priced at $9,995, a savings of 28 percent. <br>
<p>
Server pricing changes are effective worldwide; workstation pricing in<br>
U.S. and Europe. <br>
<p>
Larger Memory Systems <br>
<p>
"Lower memory prices are fueling the trend toward larger-memory<br>
systems," said Pauline Nist, vice<br>
president of DIGITAL's AlphaServer Business Segment. "Customers are<br>
becoming aware of the dramatic<br>
performance and scaling gains when larger portions of database-intensive<br>
applications are accessed<br>
directly from memory. Very-Large-Memory AlphaServer systems, combined<br>
with 64-bit addressing and<br>
raw speed, give customers a superior, high-performance computing<br>
platform." <br>
<p>
The new prices make the AlphaServer 4100 systems -- the first midrange<br>
systems to offer VLM -- 34<br>
percent more affordable than a comparable Sun UltraEnterprise 4000<br>
system. The AlphaServer 1000A<br>
system is now priced to compete head-on with the Compaq 1500. And<br>
DIGITAL's high-quality memory is<br>
now price-competitive with any other memory in the industry. <br>
<p>
Desktop Visual Computing Excellence <br>
<p>
"Reducing AlphaStation prices is a key element of DIGITAL's continued<br>
drive to provide desktop visual<br>
computing excellence to our customers," said Philippe Ribeyre, vice<br>
president of DIGITAL's Workstation<br>
Business Segment. "Today, we deliver the world's fastest UNIX and<br>
Windows NT 3D workstations at a<br>
fraction of competitors' prices." <br>
<p>
As a result of the pricing reductions, an AlphaStation 500/333 delivers<br>
up to 21 percent more<br>
performance at 21 percent less cost than an HP C160L-Vis24, and up to 20<br>
percent better performance<br>
than a comparably priced Sun UltraSPARC 170E. <br>
<p>
AlphaServer systems and AlphaStation workstations are based on the<br>
powerful, reliable, and affordable<br>
64-bit Alpha RISC architecture. DIGITAL provides its customers all the<br>
benefits of the company's strategic<br>
partnerships with leading software vendors, and a clear path to the<br>
future without costly and<br>
time-consuming migrations. <br>
<p>
Digital Equipment Corporation is a world leader in open client/server<br>
solutions, from personal computing<br>
to integrated worldwide information systems. DIGITAL's scalable Alpha<br>
and Intel platforms, storage,<br>
networking, software and services, together with industry-focused<br>
solutions from business partners, help<br>
organizations compete and win in today's global marketplace. <br>
