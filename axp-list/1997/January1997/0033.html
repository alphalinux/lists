   Can someone comment on the speed (anyone running gaussian or some other<br>
   fp intensive task and/or code development) of 21164 based systems.  My<br>
   research advisor has asked for some input on hardware/OS solutions and<br>
   I'm itching to go with Linux, but if Digital UNIX is a superior OS for<br>
   software development I'll go with that.<br>
<p>
   Also, if you people could share your experiences with Alpha Linux as a<br>
   development platform (productivity/stability of the OS) I'd be stoked.<br>
    I'm trying to convince our research group to go with UNIX (either Linux<br>
   or Digital UNIX) instead of VMS and nobody here wants to monkey with the<br>
   operating system, they just want to code.<br>
<p>
If your choice is VMS vs. Unix, you are probably surrounded by old VMS<br>
hands, and it is almost impossible to have a rational discussion :^). <br>
There is no doubt that VMS is poorly suited for general scientific <br>
computing (lack of good tools for data massaging/evaluation), <br>
but try telling that to a VMS fan.<br>
<p>
I must say that for scientific coding, Linux is still an adventure, for the<br>
following reasons:<br>
<p>
	- Linux math libraries are still unoptimized (Basic Linear Algebra routines<br>
	  especially, which happens to be important for Gaussian)<br>
<p>
	- gcc compiles slowly (say half of DEC cc's speed) and generates slightly<br>
	  slower code (say 10% slower)<br>
<p>
	- the compiling environment is still under development: no profiling,<br>
	  minor problems with the debugger <br>
	  <br>
On the other hand, the economics are in favor of Linux: you can buy a<br>
500 MHz Linux machine for $6000, probably less than you might pay for<br>
a 300 MHz DEC workstation with DEC Unix, which is the easiest way of<br>
getting a fully DEC machine (one could also buy separately the $6000<br>
machine and DEC Unix licence (which seems to cost around $700---correct <br>
me please if I am wrong, e.g. if this price is only for .edu people).<br>
<p>
In short, if one wants to avoid learning the intimacies of Alpha<br>
booting and kernel compilation, and money is no object, one would buy<br>
a 'DEC workstation package'. If one is not afraid to tinker a little,<br>
and familiar with Unix and Linux in general, one could afford a little<br>
inefficiency here and there; the faster hardware makes up for slower<br>
software.<br>
<p>
All in all, my advice is to 'ride with Linux', but YMMV.<br>
