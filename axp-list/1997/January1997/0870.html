Hello,<br>
<p>
[First, I'd like to state that I'm a total newbie in problems relating <br>
to the alpha AXP machine [my UDB] and linux [my last contact with this OS <br>
was sometime during 1994.]<br>
<p>
Recently [4 days back] I got my brand new DEC alpha UDB box directly from <br>
onsale. It included 32 MB of mem and 2.2GB SISC hardrive. I've never <br>
installed this perticular distrubtion of linux [RH] and this is my first <br>
time doing so. The installion was fine [took me a whole night and the <br>
next day] and I was satisfied to see that everthing was working fine. YESH!<br>
[even got the X server  [TGA -yuck] running.]<br>
<p>
Well.. then I noted that UDB had some sort of sound card in it. Being a <br>
multi-media myself.. I immdiatly started looking thought the (dated) <br>
HOW-TO's and FAQ's on installing a kernel and getting the sound to work. <br>
BTW : Note that i'm using the Alpha-linux RedHat 4.0 CD and my kernel <br>
version is 2.0.18. I ran  'make config' and went through everthing stated <br>
there and selecting the sound card as 'Microsoft Sound System' and 530, <br>
9, 3 as the iq... dma and other meaningless stuff.. then selected <br>
``OPL3'' well the compling was fast. But it ended up in an error --some <br>
weird one. and right above the error was some stuff about OPL3 and errors <br>
fromt that. I was confused.. and did make config again and again [yesh.. <br>
i've got patience..].. well.. after some time I fired up the X server and <br>
ran 'make xconfig' which was very neat. It still gave the same error on <br>
OPL3 sound stuff. So I decided to take OPL3 off. [there awas a note under <br>
help on that paticular option, stating that OPL3 should be included]. <br>
Well I compliled the kernel and volla.. it worked! But I still dont get <br>
music.<br>
<p>
Help me please!!!! Also, what's the latest kernel around.. and where can <br>
i get it from? Has anyone got a compiled kernel for a UDB??? I'd love to <br>
use that instead of re-compiling mine for the 1000th time. :)<br>
<p>
Ishan.<br>
<p>
ps: more to come.... when I get my memory block off... <br>
