Hi all,<br>
 just a quick announcement of 2.1.23 on the normal ftp-sites: this kernel<br>
contains several interesting patches:<br>
<p>
 - SMP cleanup: moving the kernel locks from low-level assembly into the C<br>
   level (where we can now start to make it a lot mroe efficient and<br>
   scalable). David Miller.<br>
<p>
 - Sparc updates. David &amp; co.<br>
<p>
 - poll() system call. This one was required by Digital UNIX<br>
   compatibility, and as just about everybody else (except native<br>
   Linux/x86) including iBCS2 had a poll() emulation on top of select() I<br>
   decided to do it _correctly_. In 2.1.23 the native internal interface<br>
   is actually closer to "poll()", and select() is implemented on top of<br>
   that interface.<br>
<p>
The poll() stuff (along with some other things) make Linux able to run<br>
Digital UNIX 4.0 shared libs (or at least "netscape"), so if anybody has<br>
had problems with the Digital UNIX binary compatibility on alphas you<br>
might want to check it out with this kernel instead. <br>
<p>
The SMP code isn't efficient _yet_, so don't expect to see a large jump in<br>
scalability at this point. It's just a huge conceptual step on the way to<br>
real scalability. And _definitely_ worth checking out for stability,<br>
because the patches are non-trivial. <br>
<p>
The sparc update means that the default kernel should be more-or-less in<br>
sync with David Miller. Pretty much total integration. <br>
<p>
Oh, over to other things. I just learnt that there have been lots of<br>
patches on the kernel mailing lists, and people have wondered why they<br>
haven't been applied. The simple answer is that I haven't been reading the<br>
mailing lists for the last month or two, due to the new baby and my<br>
thesis. The noise ratio was simply too bad for it to make much sense. <br>
<p>
Please do continue to use the kernel mailing list for patches - but use it<br>
more as a "please test this out before I submit this to Linus" medium. If<br>
you have real patches that you _really_ think should go in the standard<br>
kernel, you should send them to me directly (or alternatively to the<br>
people that maintain that particular subsystem - I am not necessarily<br>
always the best person to send patches to). <br>
<p>
Final note: it is likely that our move to the US starts at the end of next<br>
week. That's when the computers are packed and take the boat abroad. As a<br>
result, I probably won't have access to computers at home, and while I<br>
certainly intend to continue to maintain the kernel (through the<br>
university), I'll have even less time for secondary concerns. Bug-reports<br>
and valid patches will always be wellcome, but I might not react much to<br>
anything else..<br>
<p>
 Sorry for the inconvencience, I can only say that this should be<br>
temporary until we get settled down in the US..<br>
<p>
