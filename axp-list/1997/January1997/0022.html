<i>&gt; Can someone comment on the speed (anyone running gaussian or some other</i><br>
<i>&gt; fp intensive task and/or code development) of 21164 based systems.  My</i><br>
<i>&gt; research advisor has asked for some input on hardware/OS solutions and</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm itching to go with Linux, but if Digital UNIX is a superior OS for</i><br>
<i>&gt; software development I'll go with that.</i><br>
<p>
Well its sort of hard to make blanket statements, but I use both<br>
operating systems, and I will try to answer your question.<br>
<p>
Digital Unix is a VERY nice OS, but it is somewhat of a resource pig.<br>
As an example one of the new features of Digital Unix 4.0 is that it will<br>
actually work on a system with "only" 24 M of ram.  I run it on multi-cpu<br>
machines with between 1 and 4 G of ram, so I really don't care how much<br>
memory the kernel uses, but this may be important to you.  The development<br>
tools are nice, but gdb does not work particularly well.  Digital has a nice<br>
debugger called ladebug, but it uses dbx syntax which is somewhat of a pain<br>
if you are used to gdb.  I was pleased to see that gzip, CVS, emacs, and<br>
tcl/tk come with the OS.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I'm trying to convince our research group to go with UNIX (either Linux</i><br>
<i>&gt; or Digital UNIX) instead of VMS and nobody here wants to monkey with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; operating system, they just want to code.</i><br>
<p>
Linux/Alpha is not yet a mature system.  For me this is a plus because<br>
it means that I might actually be able to contribute to or learn from its<br>
development.  I learned a tremendous amount about operating systems by<br>
following alt.os.linux, and it was great fun.  I can get some of the<br>
same enjoyment I got from the early days of Linux/x86 development by<br>
following Linux/Alpha development.<br>
<p>
However, your goal is NOT to learn/hack the OS, but to use it.  Assuming<br>
that you can afford the software and ram, I would go with Digital Unix.<br>
The libraries are more optimized, the compiler produces better code,<br>
the compiler runs faster, and the debugger is faster.  I hope that<br>
this is not true forever.  One of the nice things about Linux/Alpha<br>
is that it will run Digital Unix binaries.  If you start out with<br>
Digital Unix, you can switch to Linux at some point in the future,<br>
and still run your binaries (and you will have a license for all the<br>
libs you will need).<br>
<p>
Hope this helps,<br>
<p>
Jim<br>
<p>
PS Netscape runs under Digital Unix, but java applets dont work.<br>
