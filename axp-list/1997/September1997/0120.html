Well, after spending mucho $$ to outfit this Alpha UDB, I'm not only<br>
having RAM problems (and *was* planning on buying another 64MB RAM<br>
tomorrow, to see if they were with the new SIMMs), but now the floppy<br>
drive is pretty much useless.<br>
<p>
Whenever I try to read anything from the floppy under Linux, I get<br>
a bunch of "floppy probe 0: error" or messages somewhat like that.<br>
<p>
Even working in ARC, no floppy disk can be read.  Under Linux,<br>
formatting (e.g. via `fdformat /dev/fd0H1440') seems to work fine<br>
until it goes to verify, when it suddenly can't find sectors.<br>
<p>
It was working fine as I started trying a RedHat Linux install to<br>
try and figure out whether the problems I was running into at the<br>
time were due to Craftwork Linux or some hardware problem...I got<br>
far enough to determine that it was a memory problem, as RedHat<br>
had at least as many of these problems as Craftwork.  But at some<br>
point during this process, the Redhat floppies stopped working,<br>
and I figured, at the time, I had somehow overwritten them or<br>
something, and just went back to using Craftwork, which was still<br>
installed on the hard drive, as a means to figure out the memory<br>
problems.<br>
<p>
(Note that some of these disks have been verified, even formatted<br>
and written, just fine on my GNU/Linux i486 system...I've been<br>
depending on floppies to transfer stuff from my 486 to the UDB,<br>
to test out g77 on the UDB.)<br>
<p>
Is there any reasonable, inexpensive fix to this?  Or would I just be<br>
throwing good money after bad (well, the UDB was a gift), so do you<br>
think I should just abandon (toss) the UDB given that it has both<br>
memory and floppy problems?  (Maybe I can still make use of it once<br>
I get my LAN up and running, but how many more problems is this box<br>
going to have?!)<br>
<p>
At one point I wondered if the ARC environment had been fried, and<br>
tried resetting to factory defaults.  This didn't help; the floppy<br>
drive remained useless.  (The system seems to think it's a 2.88MB<br>
drive at this point -- would that be a problem even for `fdformat<br>
/dev/fd0H1440' and, if so, how do I fix this?)<br>
<p>
I can probably still make good use of the new external box, which I<br>
spent the most $$ on, as there's a possibility of getting a new<br>
higher-end Alpha...but at times like this I feel like selling all<br>
this half-working hardware and spending the rest of my life in a<br>
subway station playing the saxophone or something.  :(<br>
