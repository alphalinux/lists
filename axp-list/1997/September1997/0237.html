<i>&gt; I'm sure this is not the most ideal place, and sorry if it has been covered </i><br>
<i>&gt; before .. but it's the only place I know of :-)</i><br>
<p>
As a UDB owner and current maintainer of the UDB/Linux FAQ, I'll take a<br>
stab at answering your questions.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; I have the opportunity to buy a 2nd hand DEC Multia 166mhz, 32mb RAM, 340mb </i><br>
<i>&gt; HD, no monitor.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Any comments on what this workstation would be worth? and will Linux run on it?</i><br>
<p>
Various UDB users have reported that the performance of the machines for<br>
non-Floating Point Intensive application is equivalent to a P100. This is<br>
mostly in line with my own impressions. The 166Mzh machine cannot have its CPU <br>
upgraded so you are stuck with this speed. You can't even overclock this model<br>
to squeeze some more speed out of it.<br>
<p>
Things to watch out for.<br>
<p>
Disk space: Alpha binaries are larger than intel binaries by 15$ to 33%.<br>
This means that 340MB doesn't go very far. You can make a reasonable<br>
network workstation from that. Otherwise, you are going to have to hang an<br>
external hard disk off the back of the unit. <br>
<p>
Heat: The UDB's case is so campact that many folks have discovered that<br>
they have problems with their machines due to it overheating. The problems<br>
range from memory errors to the machine refusing to boot. For this reason,<br>
it is actually strongly suggested that you go with an external only hard<br>
drive to reduce the amount of internal heat. For what its worth, I'm personally went from an external hard disk to an internal hard disk and i'm not having<br>
any problems. I'm just a thrillseeker I guess :-)<br>
<p>
Video: The built in video adapater on the UDB is commonly known as the TGA1<br>
which has 2MB of RAM on it. Due to its design, it can only do 8bpp with<br>
will give you 256 color. It can do a resolution up to 1280x1024 though<br>
which is really nice. Your model has a PCI slot in it so you can put a<br>
different graphics card in it that will do &gt; 8 bpp color. <br>
<p>
You'll use the noname.img file to boot the UDB. RedHat 4.2 for Apha works<br>
like a charm.<br>

Understanding is a three-edged sword: your side, their side and the truth.
