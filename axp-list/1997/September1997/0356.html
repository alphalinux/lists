Close to a year ago I posted to this list that I would not be able to use<br>
an Alpha in a mainstream server, as the list of available commercial s/w<br>
was not complete enough.  A Digital employee asked me precisely what apps<br>
were missing, and I replied with a list that I was short then.<br>
<p>
ViaCrypt PGP was one of them, as was an Alpha port of Stronghold.  The PGP<br>
binary is a.out format, which em86 would not run at the time; I had no<br>
time to hack a.out because I have a perfectly viable platform in front of<br>
me that lets me get on with making a living.  I think C2 dropped the Alpha<br>
Stronghold port some time ago, and I haven't heard that they picked it up. <br>
The Linux RealAudio binary did not initially run with em86 (missing<br>
ioctls), and I've not heard an update on its status. <br>
<p>
Now I have the Solid SQL server for the Intel platform, and it is in<br>
binary format only.  These types of critial performance servers are not<br>
the kind of thing that I want to run under an emulator.  I have a pair of<br>
UDBs, which are not powerful enough to give me a valid understanding about<br>
how Solid might run under em86 than on a native P[56] platform. <br>
<p>
My contact with Linux/Alpha is entirely through this list.  If there is a<br>
better forum to follow I would very much like to hear about it.  Digital<br>
seems to have mostly dropped off this list, and the efforts that were<br>
going on a year ago have gone silent (underground?). <br>
<p>
Bottom line for me:  the 500 MHz machines look very attractive, but until<br>
Digital helps make a market by assisting a wide variety of application<br>
developers to port current apps to Linux/Alpha, I cannot consider it for a<br>
mainline server.  The two UDBs are doing find running standard chores like<br>
FTP servers, etc, but such apps are no longer sufficient to run a<br>
frontline server. <br>
