<i>&gt;At times the room is around 80-82F, which is hard to avoid since this is</i><br>
<i>&gt;in Texas on the southwest corner with a fairly large south facing window. </i><br>
<p>
Whew, IMO, you *really* have to change your setup.  I know it can be<br>
expensive; in a sense, we moved to solve our problem (and got 2x the<br>
floor space as well); but of course each person should evaluate for<br>
themselves which will cost them more, providing a suitable environment<br>
for their computers or replacing their computers more often (and having<br>
flaky behavior in the meantime).  (For myself, I can't afford, still,<br>
to simply replace computers that fail, and can't really afford flakiness<br>
or my work becomes nearly useless, so I even unplug all my machines<br>
when thunderstorms threaten.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;At times when it gets warm the machines get flakey and I need to restart</i><br>
<i>&gt;them, but they won't even get to the point of loading ARC.  What is wierd</i><br>
<i>&gt;is that they won't restart at times even with the cover off and fan</i><br>
<i>&gt;blowing directly on the entire box.  The CPU chip fins are just barely</i><br>
<i>&gt;warm to the touch, and it still won't restart, which makes me wonder if it</i><br>
<i>&gt;is a heat related problem or something else. </i><br>
<p>
I don't know.  "Hot to the touch" can be fairly relative, I would think;<br>
if you're in an 80-degree room, perhaps 110 degrees wouldn't seem as warm<br>
as it would to me in my office (which is currently 68.4 :).  Further, the<br>
CPU chip might have gotten lots of heat attention in the engineering,<br>
but it might be *other* components that are failing due to their<br>
overheating.  Finally, *where* the heat is building up might matter more<br>
than where you can feel it.  For example, cars build up fairly intense<br>
heat right in their engines' pistons and stuff; the heat is moved away<br>
from these via the various cooling mechanisms (forced air, water, and<br>
so on), and sometimes the thermometer, or where you might place your<br>
hand, is too far away to properly assess the heat, especially right after<br>
turning the thing off.  That's why some cars have fans that stay on<br>
after the engine goes off -- it's right at that moment that the engine<br>
might have the most heat risk *internally*, so that's a bad time to<br>
turn off all the cooling systems.  Apparently, your car's engine could<br>
be melting down a minute later due to not being able to get rid of<br>
*internal* heat at the same precise moment that you're putting your<br>
hand on top of the hood and saying "hey, this isn't so warm", because<br>
the outside air has already cooled the *hood* (but not the sensitive<br>
internals).  You might be experiencing something similar with your<br>
UDB, that is, incorrectly assessing the internal heat based on the<br>
external temperature differential (versus ambient).<br>
<p>
So, it could be your CPU chip is overheating, the fins register it,<br>
but you don't consider them to be hot; or that some other component<br>
is overheating, not the CPU chip; or the CPU is overheating inside<br>
due to the fins not being able to draw enough heat away from the<br>
inside (due in turn to too-high ambient temperature) but, again, you<br>
don't feel it, because the internal heat build-up doesn't always<br>
translate into obviously high external (fin-surface) heat.<br>
<p>
The most practical way, perhaps, to diagnose whether you have a heat<br>
problem is to run the machine similarly for long periods of time in<br>
a well-AC'ed place, say, Northgate Mall in Dallas (most other malls<br>
will do -- IIRC they AC malls down to 63F in the South ;-).  If it<br>
fails similarly, you have another problem (maybe still heat-induced,<br>
but not high-ambient-temperature induced, e.g. a broken cooling<br>
fan or intermittently failing chip).  Otherwise, you've diagnosed<br>
your problem.<br>
<p>
As usual, this is all guesswork.  I am *not* an expert, or even<br>
all that knowledgable about these things.<br>
