   Most risc machines can only accept a datum on a natural boundary,<br>

<p>
Correct so far...<br>
<p>
   This is not true with the Power PC, BTW The alpha design team didn't<br>
   really know what they were doing.  In any event to answer your question,<br>
   its the job of the compiler to properly align things.  If you get this <br>
   message then its really a compiler bug, i.e. the compiler that was used<br>
<p>
but it is is no longer so in this paragraph. The Alpha team knew well<br>
what they were doing. Any modern memory is organized in words (often 4<br>
or 8 bytes, sometimes even 16 bytes), so non-aligned access is a bad<br>
match, and, if the loaded item crosses memory word boundary, requires<br>
two memory cycles. There are ways of handling this (caches/prefetching), <br>
but they complicate things; that is why initial Alpha architecture<br>
simply dropped unaligned loads (BTW, they were added in a recent<br>
revision).<br>
<p>
Sometimes, however, unaligned loads are necessary. In particular,<br>
the Ethernet packets, which are delivered by hardware as a binary block,<br>
have internal parts that aren't aligned. If one just grabs them,<br>
one ends up with an unaligned load. Of course it is possible to copy<br>
them byte by byte to an aligned buffer and access it there, but this<br>
requires special-case code in the driver, which wasn't done.<br>
<p>
In any case, the compiler doesn't figure here.<br>
