<i>&gt;I start getting errors after 10 hrs at 75F.  It's getting into fall here,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and with the window open this evening the thermistat in the comp room says</i><br>
<i>&gt;57F (low 40's outside), the therm sitting in the airstream of an idle UDB</i><br>
<i>&gt;reads 76...  Between the 2 UDB's I can heat half this place, so I wouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;totally rule it out as a problem.  An even *slightly* flaky simm would</i><br>
<i>&gt;give trouble next to that heating element DEC calls a CPU.</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, that's similar to the problems I've long had here in my home<br>
office, though in this new condo, it's in the basement, which helps<br>
a *lot*.  (In our first condo, my office was in the 2nd floor SW-facing<br>
bedroom; during the spring/fall days, outside temps 55-70F or so,<br>
we'd have to A/C the rest of the house down to around 63F to keep<br>
my office below about 78F, even with only that one vent open!)<br>
<p>
Anyway, I doubt we can afford to run our home A/C sufficiently to keep<br>
ambient here in my office down below 70F.  (It's 71.7 right now.)  I do<br>
have two smallish fans to blow the heat stack off the top of my 486<br>
(tower under the desktop) and its monitor.  The thermometer I have has<br>
an external sensor I've placed above the tower just under the desk;<br>
I try to keep the temp of that air (basically coming out of the tower)<br>
below 80F, usually in the 78-80 range, below that I don't worry so<br>
much.  The little Brookstone-bought fan that pushes air through that<br>
area knocks about 2F off that temperature, which is nice, and it's<br>
fairly quiet in most directions.  (The Holmes fan for the monitor is<br>
much noisier, so I might replace that with a new Brookstone.)<br>
<p>
While I can't imagine getting the ambient here down much lower than I do,<br>
for personal comfort reasons as well as affordability, it *is* good<br>
to know there are people out there "crazier" than me.  I've talked<br>
to various HVAC types, even gotten an estimate on doing some minor<br>
improvement to vent heat up from the basement (so we don't freeze on<br>
the 1st floor ;-), and everyone seems to think it's weird I even<br>
*care* about what temperature my computers run at.  (I think even<br>
my wife wonders about me.)<br>
<p>
Maybe now I'll worry less about the ambient going below 70F, though,<br>
especially when I'm not in the office.  Right now I have only one<br>
computer (an old, hot, 486) running; pretty soon I'll have two (add<br>
the UDB, hopefully), then three (another Alpha?), maybe even four<br>
(an UltraSPARC?), though all but one will normally have the monitors<br>
powered off.  I'm concerned about this; the rough estimate for a<br>
special built-in A/C unit in the office is around $5K or so, which<br>
I don't happen to have in my wallet right now.  Might have to relocate<br>
some systems w/o monitors; fortunately, I have cat-5 cabling to several<br>
locations in the condo already built into the walls (foresight on my<br>
part, I hope it actually works ;-), so I could put one machine in<br>
the other basement room near the electrical panel, another in the loft,<br>
maybe one in my wife's office (if it's quiet enough), etc.  I'm hoping<br>
the much more modest plan I have an estimate on suffices.<br>
<p>
If only this wasn't a condo, and we actually *owned* the back yard<br>
ourselves.  Then I could dig out a special underground, cheap-to-cool<br>
room for all these computers.  Yeah, that'd be the ticket.  (And<br>
I'd have another worry: flooding.)<br>
