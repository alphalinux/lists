I recently posted about recent power problems that I've had with a pair of<br>
UDBs. They would quit working,and then at some arbitrary point later would<br>
start working again.  I thought it might be heat related, but high volume<br>
forced air experiments have shown that not to be the case.  One has been<br>
worse than the other, but both developed the same problem within a couple<br>
of weeks of each other. <br>
<p>
I think I *finally* found the problem. <br>
<p>
I found yesterday that while poking around the motherboard power supply<br>
connectors with VOM leads that it would suddenly start working again. <br>
Since then I have been able to verify empirically that pulling and<br>
reseating the connector will restore it every time. <br>
<p>
Examining the p/w connectors carefully this afternoon, I noticed that the<br>
white connector housing had discolored around the two green wires, the 3.3<br>
volt feed.  I surmise that this is the chip supply, though I don't know<br>
for sure.  The two green leads were getting too hot right at the m/b. <br>
<p>
Checking the pins carefully on the worst machine, I could see that the two<br>
green wire connectors had lost a bit of spring, and the faces of connector<br>
and m/b pins were slightly dirty.  I replaced the connector with a new one<br>
to get new connector pins with good spring in place.  I also carefully<br>
rubbed the m/b pins down with a fairly hard pencil eraser to clean them.<br>
<p>
I did this to both machines, and they both came right up.  I won't know if<br>
this has really fixed it for a few days, but I have a fair amount of<br>
confidence so far, as this would explain the intermittent symptoms that I<br>
have seen. <br>
<p>
Thought this might be a useful tip with all the UDBs out there.....<br>
