I think you missed my point.  The mission statement of the design team <br>
was flawed as evidenced by the fact that later revisions have added new <br>
features such as byte load and store, and I am happy to hear unaligned<br>
loads and assume stores.   There are really two problems, (1) there is <br>
about a couple of hundred billion lines of code in production most of <br>
which is unaligned and (2) most languages provide for some type of <br>
aliasing of data types which could lead to unaligned code.  Even if the <br>
compiler did a better job of detecting aliasing it doesn't mean that you <br>
could align things (e.g. fortran named common).  IBM new this when they <br>
designed their chip so that unaligned access cost is only one clock tick.<br>
<p>
On the first alphas, 16bit assignment of the form c = a + b; took 19 <br>
ticks,  but 32bit only 4 ticks (if I remember correctly)  that in my<br>
view is a design flaw.<br>
<p>
So you really have to live with unaligned acces, of course you always <br>
have the option when writing new code that you can more carefully align <br>
things.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; but it is is no longer so in this paragraph. The Alpha team knew well</i><br>
<i>&gt; what they were doing. Any modern memory is organized in words (often 4</i><br>
<i>&gt; or 8 bytes, sometimes even 16 bytes), so non-aligned access is a bad</i><br>
<i>&gt; match, and, if the loaded item crosses memory word boundary, requires</i><br>
<i>&gt; two memory cycles. There are ways of handling this (caches/prefetching), </i><br>
<i>&gt; but they complicate things; that is why initial Alpha architecture</i><br>
<i>&gt; simply dropped unaligned loads (BTW, they were added in a recent</i><br>
<i>&gt; revision).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sometimes, however, unaligned loads are necessary. In particular,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Ethernet packets, which are delivered by hardware as a binary block,</i><br>
<i>&gt; have internal parts that aren't aligned. If one just grabs them,</i><br>
<i>&gt; one ends up with an unaligned load. Of course it is possible to copy</i><br>
<i>&gt; them byte by byte to an aligned buffer and access it there, but this</i><br>
<i>&gt; requires special-case code in the driver, which wasn't done.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In any case, the compiler doesn't figure here.</i><br>
