<i>&gt; The only thing that troubles me about using a Peltier(?) junction</i><br>

<i>&gt; diagram I got from the manufacturer, you have to run at least 1 amp</i><br>
<i>&gt; thru it before it pays any attention to you. </i><br>
<p>
	Many packaged cooling units take 12VDC, however, the<br>
voltage/amperage requirments are different for each unit, as well as max<br>
temp differential, wast heat, and heat transfered.  You see, you don't<br>
need just a peltier wafer, you need a regulator of some type so as to<br>
prevend condensation(sp?), etc...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now most PCs have 200 to 300W power supplies, but I get the impression</i><br>
<i>&gt; most of that goes to the disk devices. Running at 1 amp the Peltier</i><br>
<i>&gt; will dissipate about 12W. Does anyone know if this would make up</i><br>
<i>&gt; a significant load on a PC's power supply along with everything else</i><br>
<i>&gt; drawing power?</i><br>
<p>
	Between the device and the regulator it could be as high as 5<br>
times that amount (depending on device size, and transfer requirments).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Which means you should probably put some kind of power regulation circuit </i><br>
<i>&gt; between the Peltier junction and the PC's power supply. That way</i><br>
<i>&gt; you can adjust the current and get just the right cooling effect. </i><br>
<p>
	This is required for safe operation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also you must use a heat sink on the hot side of the junction or you</i><br>
<i>&gt; can damage it. So a good physical arrangement would probably be to</i><br>
<i>&gt; use some heat sink compound on put the Peltier junction between the</i><br>
<i>&gt; CPU and the heat sink.</i><br>
<p>
	This is an absolute!  You must use a 25% - 50% oversize<br>
(heat transfer wise, not size), the peltier unit will move heat from one<br>
side to the other, BUT all that power you feed it comes out as heat on the<br>
hot side.<br>
<p>
	The main problem with the use of a peltier wafer as a CPU cooler<br>
is this.  While you can easily cool your proccesor below ambient during<br>
normal operation, should the device fail you are worse off than having no<br>
heatsink at all.  You see, without power, or when damaged (easy to do, any<br>
twisting/bending/shock can cause failure) a peltier device becomes a<br>
wonderful insulator.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; <a href="http://www.photocool.com/tecool.htm">http://www.photocool.com/tecool.htm</a> gives a pretty good overview. The </i><br>
<i>&gt; specifics have to do with cooling photomultipliers, so they may not </i><br>
<i>&gt; neccessarily apply to cooling CPUs. However the main thing to </i><br>
<i>&gt; remember is even with a cooling fan and a heat sink, there is a limit</i><br>
<i>&gt; to how much temperature differential they can create. Theoretically</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the laboratory, Peltiers can cause a 70 deg. Temperature </i><br>
<i>&gt; differential. Realistically, under these conditions I would expect</i><br>
<i>&gt; no more than 20 deg.</i><br>
<p>
	Depending on the device, 50 deg is easily had.  Also the devices<br>
are stackable (within the max/min temp range of the units).  I had much<br>
fun with salvaged units.  I pulled 18 large wafers used for force cooling<br>
power transistors in some microwave transmitters, and cooled some pentiums<br>
with em.  With 8 stacked, a 6"x4"x3" (l/w/h) heatsink, and a large fan<br>
-100F was achievable for a short time (really pushing it) and -75F could<br>
be kept for some time.  Overclocking was easy, but after a while the frost<br>
of the CPU would cause major problems.<br>
<p>
	Also, I ended up toasting one CPU, a wafer near the top failed, so<br>
the 6 lower units were all dumping heat from the power they drew, but with<br>
1 wafer playi8ng insulator... :(  The problem went away when they melted<br>
the wires off but by then the CPU was cooked good, along with the socked<br>
on the MB.<br>
<p>
<p>
	Anyway, if absolutely needed I use em, but beware, most of the<br>
PC CPU peltier coolers you see are not that great.  Cheap regulators,<br>
faulty failure alarms etc...  A quality device is great, the prob is<br>
finding one (instead of building a regulator for one).<br>
