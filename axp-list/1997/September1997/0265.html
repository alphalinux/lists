<p>
First off, it's not the 500MHz clock, its the 1024 ticks/sec RTC.<br>
<p>
What the additional code does, is check that there's really an interrupt<br>
posted in the RTC status register; if not, it ignores it. Previously, the<br>
register was simply read (which clears the interrupt) but not checked,<br>
believing that the interrupt would come through only when there *was one<br>
posted.<br>
<p>
I think the problem occurs in that the core logic chipset on the MIATA/LX164,<br>
known as PYXIS, seems to not have its interrupt cleared fast enough when the<br>
RTC register is read; the interrupt code may exit and re-enable interrupts<br>
when the interrupt bit in PYXIS has not been cleared yet, thus re-entering<br>
interrupt level right away, falsely.<br>
<p>
The above info was related to me by the person who did/does the SRM console<br>
on MIATA, because they saw the same problem (clock too fast) and had the<br>
necessary equipment to track it down, or intelligence to figure it out... :-)<br>

<i>&gt;Doesn't dec have a cure where they will distribute their PAL code. This</i><br>
<i>&gt;does seem to be a serious bug that might warrent a PAL upgrade ( FREE i</i><br>
<i>&gt;hope  to those that have the prob ).</i><br>
<p>
If we were using the *official* PALcode for MIATA, we wouldn't see this, as<br>
its been fixed. However, MILO's PALcode is *not* the official one.<br>
<p>
And yes, we *do* distribute the PALcode, but its the sample PALcode that<br>
Digital Semiconductor releases for their boards, of which MIATA is not one.<br>
So, we have been using the EB164 sample PALcode, which uses CIA and not<br>
PYXIS, and thus doesn't have this problem.<br>
<p>
And of course, the solution, when available, will be FREE as MILO always<br>
has been... :-)<br>
