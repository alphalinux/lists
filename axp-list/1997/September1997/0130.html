	I don't know about crazy, Alaskan maybe.  Any I do hate it in the<br>
summers.  They are nice, but local lows are -45F winter, and highs of<br>
~+85F summer (think we broke 90F a rew days this year).  I try to keep<br>
things cooler, both for the computers, and me.  At 72 I am not happy.<br>
Winter is nicer, though I can remember several times last year when I had<br>
to stop typing, my left hand was not working right.  You see, I had a Vax<br>
11/750 (bout the size of 1.5 VW rabbits) running in the room, so the<br>
window was open.  The room was nearly 80, but -40 air was coming in the<br>
window and rolling over the left side of the desk.  So I had a partially<br>
numb left hand in a hot room.  :(<br>
<p>
	I can also say for shure that LCD panels and those low power<br>
laptop drives get VERY unhappy beyond -20.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Maybe now I'll worry less about the ambient going below 70F, though,</i><br>

<i>&gt; (an UltraSPARC?), though all but one will normally have the monitors</i><br>
<i>&gt; powered off.  I'm concerned about this; the rough estimate for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; special built-in A/C unit in the office is around $5K or so, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't happen to have in my wallet right now.  Might have to relocate</i><br>
<i>&gt; some systems w/o monitors; fortunately, I have cat-5 cabling to several</i><br>
<i>&gt; locations in the condo already built into the walls (foresight on my</i><br>
<i>&gt; part, I hope it actually works ;-), so I could put one machine in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the other basement room near the electrical panel, another in the loft,</i><br>
<i>&gt; maybe one in my wife's office (if it's quiet enough), etc.  I'm hoping</i><br>
<i>&gt; the much more modest plan I have an estimate on suffices.</i><br>
<p>
Don't worry about the temp so much, most systems would not care if it were<br>
40, so long as condensation is not a problem.  As for ac, I know of server<br>
people that have build a box around an avail window, and installed a<br>
*small* RV air conditioner in the top.  Bit cheaper than central.  I just<br>
grab those generic 20" box fans, if things get 2 warm one on low will keep<br>
the comp room workable.  If you can just rig a fan or 2 and pull air from<br>
the rest of the place.  Just watch out for dust.<br>
