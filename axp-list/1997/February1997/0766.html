I am still fighting a few annoying problems on the Linux machine <br>
here. I am hoping that someone out there will be able to provide some <br>
clues as to the problems that I am seeing. <br>
<p>
The first and probably most annoying problem is that everytime I need <br>
to restart a daemon (that was started at boot time), I am unable to <br>
kill it off and restart it. It is almost as if the process is not <br>
receiving the signal. I saw a message about this about two weeks <br>
ago, but I never could find a reply to it. <br>
<p>
The other problem that I am having deals with samba. When I first <br>
loaded RedHat 4.0, samba was working quite fine. I have since <br>
installed the 2.0.27 kernel, and I can not get the samba to work <br>
anylonger. I have downloaded the latest samba RPM and installed it, <br>
but it did not have any affect. I have even tried to rebuild the <br>
source RPM, but it keeps bombing out. I have fixed some of the errors <br>
with the build, but they just keep on comming....<br>
<p>
The third problem I have been experiencing deals with innd. It seems <br>
that it is bailing out as soon as it gets started. It puts in the <br>
syslog a line sayin: SERVER internal no to group. I am not an inn <br>
guru, but I have gotten a couple running before. Anyone know what the <br>
problem is?<br>
<p>
Thanks....<br>
