Regarding all the Applix/AXP stuff.  I think that the best summation for this <br>
type of issue is that historically an operating system's success is directly <br>
related to its application support (How many applications it can run).  Now, <br>
after many years Linux/X86 is beginning to see real applications support <br>
(Caldera/Applix/Xinside/ID/etc.) and we are beginning to witness the true <br>
blooming of Linux into a real, serious contender in the professional market.<br>
<p>
This, it could be said is true of ALL commercial operating systems.  But, we <br>
all know that Linux isn't commercial (Thanks Linus) so what has made it a <br>
success and how can that apply to the AXP/SUN platforms?<br>
<p>
Linux has survived and prospered because of us.  Geeks that didn't want to <br>
blow the cash (Real Cash!) on a weak PC unix.  We wanted to hack, we wanted to <br>
play, we wanted to help.  In this, Linux began to see quite a bit of <br>
non-commercial application support almost everything you and I use everyday is <br>
non-commercial, and quite good.  Linux X86 has prospered because those of us <br>
that have always supported it have pushed and positioned it within our own <br>
environments until the idea finally started to catch on (We're still having to <br>
blow the fire though, we're not there yet).<br>
<p>
AXP/SUN Linux do have a couple of advantages over the infant Linux.  One, the <br>
ability to support native OS applications (ie. Solaris, and DU).  This right <br>
there greatly enhances the usability of the machine (Frankly, I wrote the <br>
Idiot's guide, cause I was the idiot that wouldn't run a box without netscape <br>
;-)  Also, we have all of the other X86 sources that we can compile and run to <br>
give our new toys the old toy look and feel. (Seems self defeating doesn't it? <br>
:-D)  This is creating the sparc. . .spark that may one day lead to the <br>
acceptance of AXP and SUN linux.<br>
<p>
Gasp. . .So what I'm saying is that yes, Applix and other applications should <br>
look at getting ported to the box.  It is a feedback loop that will continue <br>
to grow and grow and will return much more than is put in, in my opinion.  On <br>
the other hand (being an old corporate systems vet.) it is quite expensive to <br>
port these programs and it is, in the end, a business decision.  Linux <br>
(AXP/SUN) will survive, improve, and prosper until such time that it is a cost <br>
effective business decision to port applications.<br>
<p>
<p>
Did I say short?  I hope not.  [Gerald:  Steps slowly off soapbox]<br>
