     OK, now I've got the internal drive out, 4.0 is completely reinstalled <br>
     on the remaining drive, the box is (and has always been) in it's <br>
     vertical stand, I reseated the simms again, and I've drawn hexagrams <br>
     in chicken blood on the scsi box.  I believe I have now done <br>
     everything I have seen sugested here (note: hexagrams my own idea). I <br>
     still get"Oops..."es,"unable...paging request"s, "out of memory"s, <br>
     hang(s), processes I can't kill, and XF_TGA still dies, currently with <br>
     this message:<br>
     <br>
     Fatal server error:<br>
     xf86MapVidMem: Could not mmap framebuffer (Invalid argument)<br>
     <br>
     (core dump)<br>
     <br>
     I can only assume the hardware has self-destructed.  Maybe 1 month is <br>
     all a $1200 alpha is good for.<br>

I don't _think_ that heat is my problem -- I'm running a Cabriolet in <br>
a large tower case with plenty of ventilation (i.e. the case is off <br>
more often than on ;-), I live in northern Indiana and leave my window<br>
open constantly (I like it cold) and my room temp probably hasn't risen <br>
_above_ 50 F in a couple of months....<br>
     <br>
OTOH, there _is_ that archaic Fujitsu SCSI full-height drive, that <br>
sources many watts of heat...  But that's at the other end of the <br>
case.<br>

  "But I don't want to go among mad people," Alice remarked.
  "Oh, you can't help that," said the Cat: "we're all mad here. I'm mad.
      You're mad."
  "How do you know I'm mad?" said Alice.
  "You must be," said the Cat, "or you wouldn't have come here."
