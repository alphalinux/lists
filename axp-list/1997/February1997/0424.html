     Axp'ers,<br>
     <br>
     In the last few days I have seen several pleas for help here <br>
     concerning problems that I have also been having with 4.1:  Processes <br>
     that don't spawn/fork, "Oops" and "unable .. paging request" messages, <br>
     inability to log in, inability to boot, multiple re-installs in a vain <br>
     attempt to get up and running - I feel these are all related and I <br>
     wonder if someone knows the solution and hasn't coughed it up yet <br>
     (sorry if the answer has been posted and I missed it).  Perusing the <br>
     February archive, all of the mail so far says either a)  I have this <br>
     set of problems that makes my udb unusable, help.  Or b)  <br>
     (paraphrasing) I had that set of problems and I tried averything and <br>
     something finally must have worked because I think (fingers crossed) <br>
     I'm ok now.<br>
     <br>
     Can anyone at least tell me that installing 4.1 at home has worked <br>
     sucessfully for them and been stable.  (Does even a home install of <br>
     4.0 work?  My system worked fine out of the box but I accidentally <br>
     destroyed my partition info with cdwrite and had to reinstall 4.0 <br>
     (several times - I finally saw a hint here that helped me figure out <br>
     that an install doesn't work (don't tell me it does) with the /var and <br>
     /usr partitions on another disk - sorry if that was in the <br>
     destructions and I missed it), since then the TGA server will not run, <br>
     I see:<br>
     <br>
           can't mmap framebuffer (device is not configured) - Ha Ha!<br>
     <br>
     (well, I added the "Ha Ha", but it might as well have been in the <br>
     message).  Now that is the least of my problems with the machine <br>
     (UDB)). <a href="mailto:Terran@ecn.purdue.edu">Terran@ecn.purdue.edu</a> wondered if his fork problems might be X <br>
     related, I guess not since I have the same problems w/o any X. <br>
     <br>
     The 4.1 problems do all seem memory related (4.0 ran ok except for the <br>
     X problem).  This morning all the vc's logged in from last night were <br>
     frozen and I could not log in another, I just got some kind of "out of <br>
     memory" message (I used to be able to scrape by on 88 meg).<br>
     <br>
     <a href="mailto:Psowski@floyd.soc.uwm.edu">Psowski@floyd.soc.uwm.edu</a> says in his msg. that he also has a 266mhz <br>
     88meg udb with the same problems and desperately tried upgrading milo, <br>
     linload, kernel 2.0.27, threw his internal disk away, and reseated the <br>
     simms.  I have done most of this (I'll keep my disk, thank you).  Is <br>
     it possible that one particular kernel version (the one at the RH4.1 <br>
     ftp sites for instance) is responsible or is this happening with <br>
     within some range of kernel rev. levels?  Do we need a new mailing <br>
     list just to sort out this problem?  Should I put my system in the <br>
     closet and check back at kernel 9.x.x?<br>
     <br>
     Sincerely,<br>
     Dave Tucker<br>
