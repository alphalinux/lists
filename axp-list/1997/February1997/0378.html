<i>&gt;All of a sudden I'm getting flashbacks of the Linux world in '94.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Remember when Doom for Linux came out?  I think that proved that Linux</i><br>
<i>&gt;was worthwhile more than anything else.  Is Quake doing the same thing</i><br>
<i>&gt;for the Linux on the alpha?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, it is.  I have taken Quake to several trade shows (FED UNIX/Open<br>
Systems World in Washington, D.C. for example, and Internet World in<br>
New York City).  People would walk right past the Alpha Linux machine<br>
(particularly since Red Hat V4.0 made the standard interface look like<br>
windows)<br>
<p>
			UNTIL I STARTED UP QUAKE<br>
<p>
Then people came *literally* running across the floor to look at it.<br>
Full-screen, no pixelization.  QUAKE as it should be.<br>
<p>
At FED UNIX I had one guy who kept coming around, and stopped past<br>
several times just to look.  He was in uniform, and had more brass on<br>
his chest than I have in my favorite grandfather clock.  You could see<br>
from his face that he knew what that type of performance meant to his<br>
application (which is probably flying around in an airplane five miles<br>
up).<br>
<p>
I was also asked by the host and producer of PCTV to have Alpha Quake<br>
on his show about high-end 3D games.  It opened the show, and the awe<br>
in his voice as he talked about it was good news to me.<br>
<p>
Yup, QUAKE is a great demo, particularly when you can turn the volume<br>
up loud enough to compete with the other booths.<br>
<p>
It helps to sell vertical and turnkey applications.<br>
<p>
As to the other applications, they are coming.  Remember how long it<br>
took to get them on Intel Linux.  You will start seeing them, "soon".<br>
