Hi. I have a UDP that I want to stick my Matrox Millennium Power Desk 4mb<br>
card in so I can run at high color depths in X. I saw some traffic on this<br>
mail list about it and tried to follow all the steps but it just wont<br>
work. I installed the latest firmware from<br>
<a href="ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/interim/udb/">ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/interim/udb/</a> and that<br>
installed without a flaw. I then recompiled my kernel without TGA support.<br>
I shutdown the machine, and stuck the Matrox card in the PCI slot. When I<br>
turned the machine back on nothing happened for about a minute... then I<br>
got this screen with seems to list stuff from the Millennium's BIOS, but<br>
I'm not sure because it goes away so fast. Then It goes to the ARC<br>
console, with the blue screen. I select Boot Linux, and it then does the<br>
milo stuff on the blue screen. Then my monitor goes into power save mode.<br>
It stays like this, and nothing happens for about 5 minutes. Then it turns<br>
back on and the picture is all messed up. There seem to be to virtical<br>
lines going down the screen and everything is shaking and I can't really<br>
read anything... but It pukes all kinds of numbers up and then at the<br>
bottom of the screen it say something about a PCI error. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From MILO I also tried booting with a kernel with did have TGA support in</i><br>
it (vmlinux.tga.gz) and that did the same thing. Everything looks fine in<br>
the ARC console, but after it exists that nothing works. Hmm I just went<br>
back to the UDP to check on it and the screen is still blank, but the<br>
really weird thing is the LED on the power button was off, even though the<br>
power button was supressed. Does anyone know how to get this card to work?<br>
Someone who knows a lot about this needs to write a FAQ about it so people<br>
like me don't keep asking. :-) Any help would be greatly appriciated.<br>
Thanks. <br>
<p>
David Paris<br>
