<p>
I haven't tried removing the internal disk, but my experience these errors<br>
starting when I tried to run 2.0.x kernels.  <br>
<p>
I was running RH/AXP 3.0.3 with a 1.3.90 kernel, and everything was fine.<br>
I built my own 2.0.0 kernel, and started getting the errors.<br>
I went back to 1.3.90, and everything was fine. <br>
Later I tried 2.0.10.  Errors again.<br>
Went back to 1.3.90.  No problems.<br>
<p>
Then RH 4.0 came out, with a 2.0.18 kernel, and I figured that whatever<br>
the problem was, it had to be fixed or Red Hat wouldn't have released<br>
it.  Upgraded to RH 4.0.  Got the Oops and Unable to handle kernel paging<br>
request errors back.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately sinch RH 4.0 is ELF based, it is now really difficult for me<br>
to go back to 1.3.90.  I keep thinking that I'll do a binary search of the<br>
kernels between 1.3.90 and 2.0.0 to find out exactly where this problem was<br>
introduced, but so far I haven't found the time to do it.<br>
<p>
People have suggested that all sorts of things are wrong with my machine,<br>
from bad SIMMs and disk drives to bad SCSI cables and termination to<br>
overheating.  I don't believe any of it, since 1.3.90 and Windows NT both<br>
run flawlessly on the exact same system.<br>
<p>
Some people have suggested that the BSD driver would solve my problems, but<br>
it doesn't.<br>
<p>
I think some sort of race condition crept into newer kernels.  Maybe this<br>
weekend I'll finally get around to reinstalling RH 3.0.3 so I can try to<br>
track this down.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
Eric<br>
