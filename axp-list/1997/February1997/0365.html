<i>&gt; If folks won't support a $49 product (as of Red Hat 4.1) I seriously doubt</i><br>
<i>&gt; enough folks will shell out $199 for Applix. If we extrapolate Intel 4.1</i><br>
<i>&gt; sales to recent Applix sales and do the same for 4.1 Alpha we get some </i><br>
<i>&gt; numbers which will not come anywhere near convincing Applix to port to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the platform.</i><br>
<p>
I hadn't heard that you had dropped the price for Red Hat/Alpha...<br>
That's great news.  Let's see how that improves your sales figures.<br>
It should definitely help, possibly more than you might think.  For<br>
example, I had told the bookstore that supplies my users group with<br>
your products not to bother carrying the Alpha and Sparc versions...<br>
I couldn't see anybody paying an extra $70 (approximately) for a<br>
manual.  I just called them up to tell them to add some of both to<br>
their order for 4.1 though...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; In addition, it seems to me that the availability of decent</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; commercial-grade software should increase the demand for Red</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Hat/Alpha...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Affordable Alpha's are what increases the demand more then anything else. If</i><br>
<i>&gt; the current trends continue, that may happen in a big enough way to justify</i><br>
<i>&gt; commercial Alpha software.</i><br>
<p>
Most likely you are right.  But, just like Linux on the Intel, cheap<br>
hardware wasn't enough to drive the market.  I got my first alpha a<br>
few months ago because it was incredibly cheap, but I've considered<br>
selling it since there's really very little I can do with it<br>
(relative to my Intel boxes, that is).  All it's really done for me is<br>
give me a craving for high-end alpha hardware, which isn't at all<br>
cheap.<br>
<p>
All of a sudden I'm getting flashbacks of the Linux world in '94.<br>
Remember when Doom for Linux came out?  I think that proved that Linux<br>
was worthwhile more than anything else.  Is Quake doing the same thing<br>
for the Linux on the alpha?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I don't mean to tell you how to do business, but it seems to me that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you guys are shooting yourselves in the foot on the pricing of Red</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Hat/Alpha, if not the decision not to port Applix to Alpha.  (I'm not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; saying I disagree with your decision, just your reasoning behind it.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We agree (and lowered the price as a result). I've wanted to lower the price</i><br>
<i>&gt; for a while, though I'm nowhere near convinced it'll increase the profits</i><br>
<i>&gt; on Red Hat/Alpha one iota. While we'll sell more our profit margins were</i><br>
<i>&gt; slashed by lowering the prices (after all, our costs stayed exactly the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same) and I doubt we'll see enough volume increases to outweigh that in</i><br>
<i>&gt; and significant way.</i><br>
<p>
Maybe.  Time will tell.  :-)<br>
<p>
I'm going to stop rambling now...<br>
