Yes, I can confirm that this is definitely an issue.  I will also say that<br>
while the FCC may be taking email and letters on the subject, there's<br>
nothing you can really do to stop them from imposing this rule.  As I work<br>
for a large internet provider, we've known about this for several months<br>
now, and as it appears to us, the FCC has the power to put those<br>
regulations in place based on current legislation ( as bad as this may<br>
sound...)  I think we also all need to take into account that even though<br>
this may slow the pace of growth of the internet in america, it is a much<br>
needed fee to improve the telephone infrastructure.  All current internet<br>
backbones are already oversold, and even MCI's backbone, which is<br>
currently being upgraded to OC-48, is becoming lagged in regions where<br>
cable modems are being installed because of the great amount of bandwidth<br>
the cable companies promise to provide to their customers.  I think we all<br>
need to look at this as a much needed source of funding for an out of date<br>
and technologically lacking phone system.<br>
