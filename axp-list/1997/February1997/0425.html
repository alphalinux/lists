I have 4.1 installed, and for the most part it's been working quite<br>
well.  I've had a few weird memory problems similar to what you<br>
described (unable .. paging request), and I think they were heat<br>
related.  The errors happened most when I tried to work on it on a<br>
weekend.  My office tends to get hot on the weekends because the air is<br>
turned off.  It sounds like you have an internal drive.  If so,<br>
unfortunately, that's probably your problem.  The UDB seems to overheat<br>
very easily.  I would at least try pulling the disk out as a test.<br>

<i>&gt;      that don't spawn/fork, "Oops" and "unable .. paging request" messages,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      inability to log in, inability to boot, multiple re-installs in a vain</i><br>
<i>&gt;      attempt to get up and running - I feel these are all related and I</i><br>
<i>&gt;      wonder if someone knows the solution and hasn't coughed it up yet</i><br>
<i>&gt;      (sorry if the answer has been posted and I missed it).  Perusing the</i><br>
<i>&gt;      February archive, all of the mail so far says either a)  I have this</i><br>
<i>&gt;      set of problems that makes my udb unusable, help.  Or b)</i><br>
<i>&gt;      (paraphrasing) I had that set of problems and I tried averything and</i><br>
<i>&gt;      something finally must have worked because I think (fingers crossed)</i><br>
<i>&gt;      I'm ok now.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Can anyone at least tell me that installing 4.1 at home has worked</i><br>
<i>&gt;      sucessfully for them and been stable.  (Does even a home install of</i><br>
<i>&gt;      4.0 work?  My system worked fine out of the box but I accidentally</i><br>
<i>&gt;      destroyed my partition info with cdwrite and had to reinstall 4.0</i><br>
<i>&gt;      (several times - I finally saw a hint here that helped me figure out</i><br>
<i>&gt;      that an install doesn't work (don't tell me it does) with the /var and</i><br>
<i>&gt;      /usr partitions on another disk - sorry if that was in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;      destructions and I missed it), since then the TGA server will not run,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      I see:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;            can't mmap framebuffer (device is not configured) - Ha Ha!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      (well, I added the "Ha Ha", but it might as well have been in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;      message).  Now that is the least of my problems with the machine</i><br>
<i>&gt;      (UDB)). <a href="mailto:Terran@ecn.purdue.edu">Terran@ecn.purdue.edu</a> wondered if his fork problems might be X</i><br>
<i>&gt;      related, I guess not since I have the same problems w/o any X.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      The 4.1 problems do all seem memory related (4.0 ran ok except for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;      X problem).  This morning all the vc's logged in from last night were</i><br>
<i>&gt;      frozen and I could not log in another, I just got some kind of "out of</i><br>
<i>&gt;      memory" message (I used to be able to scrape by on 88 meg).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      <a href="mailto:Psowski@floyd.soc.uwm.edu">Psowski@floyd.soc.uwm.edu</a> says in his msg. that he also has a 266mhz</i><br>
<i>&gt;      88meg udb with the same problems and desperately tried upgrading milo,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      linload, kernel 2.0.27, threw his internal disk away, and reseated the</i><br>
<i>&gt;      simms.  I have done most of this (I'll keep my disk, thank you).  Is</i><br>
<i>&gt;      it possible that one particular kernel version (the one at the RH4.1</i><br>
<i>&gt;      ftp sites for instance) is responsible or is this happening with</i><br>
<i>&gt;      within some range of kernel rev. levels?  Do we need a new mailing</i><br>
<i>&gt;      list just to sort out this problem?  Should I put my system in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;      closet and check back at kernel 9.x.x?</i><br>
