<i>&gt; So the consensus seems to be that the DAT drive should work. My </i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; cabling and termination remains the same.</i><br>
<p>
Contrary to what others have suggested here, termination issues aren't<br>
necessarily solved just be sticking an active terminator at the end of<br>
the bus.<br>
<p>
Someone else previously wrote about SCSI terminators:<br>
<i>&gt; passive does not require power.</i><br>
<i>&gt; active  does     require power.</i><br>
<p>
Which is hogwash.  Both active and passive terminators need power, and<br>
plenty of it.  Passive terminators actually require *more* power than active;<br>
they use about 0.8 W when the bus is quiescent.  Both kinds of terminators<br>
draw substantial amounts of surge current during operation.  Often people<br>
have their SCSI chain configured such that only one device is supplying<br>
terminator power.  If you look at the power at the far end of the SCSI bus,<br>
after it has passed through several feet of small-gauge wire, it is doing<br>
really ugly, unpleasant things.<br>
<p>
The difference between active and passive is that a passive terminator will<br>
directly pass these ugly, unpleasant looking waveforms on to the data and<br>
control lines of the bus, causing all sorts of mayhem.  An active terminator<br>
has a voltage regulator that attempts to maintain proper termination voltage<br>
at all times.  But if the input power is really bad, the regulator isn't<br>
sufficient.<br>
<p>
You have to make sure that the device at the end of the chain<br>
(i.e., your DAT drive) is configured to supply terminator power to the<br>
bus, so that your terminator has a good low-impedance power source.<br>
<p>
Note that it is not easy to tell active and passive terminators apart without<br>
taking electrical measurements.  Some people have made the claim that<br>
terminators with LEDs are active, but there are passive terminators with<br>
LEDs.  Even the markings on the terminators have been known to be wrong.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
Eric<br>
