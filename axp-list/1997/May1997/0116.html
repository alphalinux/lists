<i>&gt;You have to make sure that the device at the end of the chain</i><br>
<i>&gt;(i.e., your DAT drive) is configured to supply terminator power to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;bus, so that your terminator has a good low-impedance power source.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
 Actually I have a scanner at the end of the chain, and all 5 of the <br>
external devices on the chain are configured to supply term power, as <br>
does the UDB itself. Even if the DAT drive (second unit off the UDB) was <br>
not providing power I think that there is sufficient DC available at the <br>
end.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Note that it is not easy to tell active and passive terminators apart without</i><br>
<i>&gt;taking electrical measurements.  Some people have made the claim that</i><br>
<i>&gt;terminators with LEDs are active, but there are passive terminators with</i><br>
<i>&gt;LEDs.  Even the markings on the terminators have been known to be wrong.</i><br>
<p>
This point is well taken. I once asked somebody how to tell an active <br>
terminator from a passive one and received the answer "by price", <br>
probably as good as any other method :-)<br>
<p>
But seriously, I initially had a LOT of trouble with my SCSI chain. I <br>
looked at the scsi HOWTO and it said that if you were using SCSI-II or <br>
external devices be sure to use high-quality cables that are all the same <br>
and an active terminator. I took this advice and everything worked just <br>
great.<br>
<p>
I think the "all the same" is important too, as different cables have <br>
different characteristic impedances which can cause reflections etc. <br>
Active terminators can help reduce this problem but it is better to <br>
eliminate it in the first place.<br>
<p>
An idea that a lot of folks have trouble understanding - follow the HOWTO <br>
and it works!<br>
<p>
What a concept!<br>
<p>
In any case, sorry to veer off-topic. Perhaps we should all adjourn to <br>
alt.scsi.terminators.advocacy?<br>
