Let's really have some fun in this area.  I work as a consdultant for<br>
Digital and have a lot of knowledge of where they are going.  I know<br>
that Maddog is supposed to be the top of the Unix heap, and he is.  The<br>
fact is what was once a mountain is now a molehill.  Digital has sold<br>
nearly everyone of its major Unix products to third party vendors and<br>
has lost key partnerships with other third party vendors, because it<br>
refuses to pay to see the stuff ported to the Alpha.  Examples: <br>
CohesionWorxs was sold to Bentley and Digital Tools no longer has any<br>
products that run on Digital machines.  Unix and VMS are dying at DEC<br>
which is why they even allow the Linux trade.  If they were a truly<br>
viable Unix platform they would not devote time and resources to this<br>
effort.  Digital is banking on NT, not Unix, to take it to its future.<br>
<p>
I should have fun answering the mail from this one.<br>
