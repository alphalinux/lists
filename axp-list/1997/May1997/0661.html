In a fit of pioneering spirit (read: glutton for punishment), I downloaded<br>
the 4.2/axp set (including the elm &amp; lpr updates). Installed from scratch to<br>
my UDB. Noted the following items:<br>
<p>
1. During install, starred all the package line items, including the one<br>
marked "Everything". Nonetheless, the install complained about "XF86-SETUP"<br>
not having been selected and being needed to satisfy dependencies.<br>
<p>
2. The "Howto-translations" rpm is noted as a 31 Meg rpm. As it appears to<br>
be the largest rpm in the whole set, one wonders if its size could be<br>
reduced somewhat. (Granted when you select everything, you get what you're<br>
given.)<br>
<p>
3. Once the install completed, the reboot produced the message "cannot open<br>
/lib/modules/2.0.30/modules.dep"<br>
<p>
4. The message "YPBINDPROC_DOMAIN: No server for domain: (none)" came up<br>
about six times.<br>
<p>
5. The usual (for post 4.0) short stall after amd was more than 1.5 minutes.<br>
The "starting sendmail:" message came up but never generated a "sendmail" ack.<br>
After another minute, the "starting gpm mouse services:" message came up.<br>
After 3 minutes, no gpm ack (or any other noticable functioning of the<br>
computer).<br>
<p>
6. Assuming machine was hung (just like with 4.1) I did the 3-finger salute.<br>
The switching to run-level 6 message was printed but no further actions taken.<br>
<p>
7. After rebooting from backup partition, the /var/log/messages didn't give<br>
me any indication that an error occurred. It also gave no mention of<br>
sendmail or gpm which I took to mean they failed to start.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
#ifdef SOAP_BOX_MODE_ON<br>
<p>
This does not bode well for RedHat's Quality Assurance. While I don't mind<br>
being a beta-tester, I want to know that a-priori. I PURCHASED the Official<br>
RH4.1 set only to find out it WOULDN'T EVEN BOOT out of the box. Most people<br>
(including myself) raked RH over the coals for that. Yet, it appears they<br>
may (repeat may) have done it again. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me<br>
twice, shame on me. Since the Official sets normally contain the initial<br>
release (only), I would advise against buying either 4.1 or 4.2. Get the<br>
CheapBytes version if you need a CD or download it for free (since it<br>
appears at this point to be worth every penny).<br>
<p>
#DEFINE Vent_Spleen_Mode_Complete<br>

<p>
Once again, if somebody can point me in the right direction, I'll do my bit<br>
to help out.....<br>
