Yes, and the problem is that CAD is somewhat of a specialized and relatively<br>
low volume market compared with office application suites and even databases.<br>
Particularily expensive (by PC standards) CAD packages like MicroStation.<br>
<p>
How many people in the A&amp;E world even *know* that there is a Linux port?  I<br>
have seen a brief mention in MicroStation World, but nothing else.  The<br>
demand really has to come from *this* community, rather than the Linux<br>
community per se, since only they have the resources to commit to purchasing <br>
in the kind of quantities necessary to justify Bentley's support.  Now if it<br>
were available, I would consider purchasing a copy personally, but the $3000+<br>
price tag is a little expensive for personal CAD, even though I am a CAD<br>
professional (AutoCAD and Intergraph EMS).<br>
<p>
I doubt that Linux has made enough of an impact in architecture and<br>
engineering firms to justify the numbers it would take to release a<br>
commercial port, in spite of the better technical performance of the Linux <br>
platform over NT. Perhaps when the academic users of MicroStation move into<br>
the corporate world, there will be heightened awareness.  Unfortunately, the<br>
trend I see for CAD and Engineering applications is towards WindowsNT as the<br>
platform.  Products such as ProEngineer are seeing a high demand for their NT<br>
port in just the first year of its availability, over the traditional Unix <br>
workstations.  Companies like AutoDesk and Intergraph are abandoning Unix for<br>
NT.  It is the customers that drive these companies, and a significant number<br>
are requesting and *purchasing* NT ports of CAD software.<br>
<p>
Sorry for being so negative on this.  I think Bentley is great in their<br>
support of the Linux port in the academic suite, and I hope that the<br>
situation improves towards releasing MicroStation commercially.<br>
