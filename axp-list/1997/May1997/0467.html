There was some discussion on this list previously concerning running the<br>
Digitial Unix version of Maple under Alpha/Linux.  I was wondering if<br>
anyone had had any success doing this?  I've been playing with this under<br>
both kernel version 2.0.29 and 2.1.36 and get the same behaviour.  Maple<br>
starts up fine and many commands work, but certain commands kill the maple<br>
"compuational engine".  For example, Maple has no problem with 2*2, 2^2,<br>
and 2.2^2, but 2^2.1 drops one back to the command line from maple, and<br>
xmaple gives the popup window "The Maple Computational Window is no longer<br>
executing.  No further compuations are possible in this session" <br>
<p>
If no one has been able to get Maple to work I was wondering if someone<br>
knows why it "can't" work?   To help I'll include a diff between an strace<br>
-f when I do a 2.2^2.2; and one where I do 2.2^2.  One should note that<br>
the lines such as <br>
<p>
 open("/home2/allanb/maple//lib64/type/positive.m", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT<br>
(No such file or directory)<br>
<p>
don't seem to be the problem.  The files don't exist on a DEC Unix box<br>
which runs Maple with out a hitch and one can generate such lines when<br>
running commands that appear to function fine.  Likewise the calls to<br>
SYS_112 appear for both commands that work and those that don't.<br>
<p>
<p>
It would be nice if someone could figure out the problems.  We'd love to<br>
buy Maple for all our Alpha's, but our e-mail to Waterloo Maple Inc.<br>
yielded a reply that they at that time had no intentions of releasing a<br>
version of Maple for Alpha/linux.<br>
