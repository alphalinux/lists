To add to the comments about DU's stability with reference to Linux...<br>
<p>
My experience was exactly the opposite of Tim's. I have a Microway Screamer  <br>
system with an NCR53c810 SCSI controller.  I had problems getting Linux/Alpha  <br>
(RH4.0) to run stably at all, while DU ran with absolute stability since I  <br>
bought the machine. I fiddled endlessly with the SCSI setup for the NCR810  <br>
under Linux as I thought originally it was a SCSI driver problem, although this  <br>
did not cure the problem.  Finally, with some help from Jay Estabrook at DEC  <br>
and Terry Klaila at Microway I swapped the cache static rams and I got Linux  <br>
2.0.28 to run stably (figure that one out!). <br>
<p>
<p>
Although Linux finally ran on this machine, (judged by compiling the kernel  <br>
several times back to back while doing other work) it was not so reliable with  <br>
regard to some SCSI devices.  Although I did not have any disk or CDROM errors  <br>
I could not read back a large (400+Mb) backup off my Exabyte 8200 without some  <br>
kind of SCSI error.  In desperation, without moving the cables, I rebooted to  <br>
DU and read the backup tape just fine, several times in a row.    My impression  <br>
is that the DU SCSI subsystem is rock solid, I wish Linux the SCSI drivers were  <br>
as stable.<br>
<p>
Just another two cents...<br>
<p>
