Some thoughts and questions about the high end motherboards from Digital <br>
Semiconductor (DS). Please arrest me if wrong. ;-)<br>
<p>
The EB164 motherboard has a 256-bit data bus to main memory and 64-bit data <br>
bus to the cache. Cache sizes supported are 2MB, 4MB and 8MB. It uses <br>
two Alpha cache SIMMs. This motherboard was build using the 21171 chipset <br>
supporting the 21164 processor (266-333 MHz). Was the 2MB and 4MB Alpha cache <br>
SIMMs ever available? <br>
<p>
The PC164 motherboard DRAM memory subsystem can be configured as <br>
either 128-bit or 256-bit. Cache is soldered onboard, size 1MB (9ns). <br>
Microway and DCG sells the same motherboard* with 2 MB (9ns). The L3 <br>
cache subsystem have a 128-bit data path (doubles the theoretical <br>
memory bandwidth compared to the EB164 64-bit cache-bus). A great board, <br>
pity it don't uses replaceable cache modules like the AS500/AS600. It is <br>
build on the 21172 chipset supporting the 21164A (366-500MHz).<br>
<p>
The PC164LX motherboard have 4 DIMM slots supporting SDRAM DIMMs rated at <br>
10ns (this is an advertising gimmick, they really more like 40ns...??). <br>
Compared to the PC164^ and EB164 256-bit memory bandwith, this <br>
motherboard has only 128-bit..?? The cache size is 2MB (soldered), <br>
128-bit data path. The motherboard is based on the 21174 chipset <br>
supporting the 21164A rated at 366-1000MHz (the 1000MHz is theoretical, <br>
66.66MHz*15).<br>
<p>
All in all it seems like DS must make motherboards with some kind of <br>
drawbacks. 64-bit cache access for the EB164, soldered cache chips on the <br>
PC164 and PC164LX, and only 128-bit data path on the PC164LX. <br>
<p>
On the EB164 and the PC164 the processor speed, the PCI-speed and the <br>
memory speed are controlled by the crystal oscillator and some jumpers. <br>
If I changed the division ration, using these jumpers, giving for<br>
instance 40MHz on the PCI-bus, well inside the PCI2.1 standard, will this <br>
give a performance increase of approx. 20% on I/O? Probably. <br>
Since this also decreases the access time to main memory (requiring 50ns <br>
SIMMs), problems will first arise here. I know its possible to get 50ns EDO <br>
RAM, what about 50ns 36-bit parity RAM?? The PCI-cards can also create <br>
problems. Read the proper news-groups to get peoples experience with <br>
increasing the PCI-bus speed on Intel-based PC's. <br>
<p>
Then to the DIMMs of the PC164LX. The 430TX from Intel supports both <br>
SDRAM DIMMs and EDO SIMMs. Peoples experience with motherboard based on <br>
this chipset is: for memory speed increase to 80MHz (max 40MHz on PCI-bus) <br>
50ns EDO RAM is prefered (price), for 100MHz system (max 50MHz on PCI-bus) <br>
the 100MHz SDRAM DIMMs are the only alternative. Problem with systems <br>
using 50MHz on bus is the PCI-card. Very few manage to operate under this <br>
speed. Back to the PC164LX, 40ns 128-bit memory access gives  theroretical <br>
transfer-speed of 0.4 GB/s, the EB164 with 60ns 256-bit bandwith gives approx<br>
0.5 GB/s.... A EB164/PC164 with 50ns 256-bit memory access gives 0.64 GB/s, <br>
that is 60% more than the PC164LX...<br>
<p>
Everything I know about the PC164LX is based on:<br>

<p>
I hope some people from Digital or else will prove me wrong, but hell, <br>
this is what learning is about. ;-)<br>
<p>
And, at last, the final question. Both the EB164, PC164 and the PC164LX <br>
have 2 64-bit PCI slots. Anybody delivering products using these slots <br>
to full extend? I've heard a rumor saying Intel don't want to support it <br>
because they have to base it on Digital's solution...<br>
<p>
* If I'm not to wrong, Microway swapped the cache chips. Great job!<br>
<p>
^ Can be configured as either 128-bit or 256-bit.<br>

PS: Experimenting with your system may destroy it permenently! I take no <br>
    responsibility. <br>
