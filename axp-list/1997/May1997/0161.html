Hi,<br>
<p>
I would like to clarify some of the things that I said in the *2.5 hour* :-)<br>
talk in Dallas:<br>
<p>
<a href="mailto:cbbrowne@knuth.brownes.org">cbbrowne@knuth.brownes.org</a> said:<br>
<i>&gt;a) Alpha Linux sells more *new* boxes with Digital Unix than it does with </i><br>
<i>&gt;Linux.</i><br>
<p>
Currently Digital has no system that ships without a license.  We ship our<br>
system boxes with a license for either WNT, Digital UNIX or OpenVMS.  The UDB<br>
was a special case.  In fact, the reason its name was changed from "Multia"<br>
to "UDB" was a reflection of that decision, since "Multia" described both<br>
the hardware and the software that originally shipped with it.<br>
<p>
Our single-board computers which are made by Digital Semiconductor, and are<br>
used in a series of OEM systems, are sold without an operating system.<br>
<p>
Therefore it is impossible for us to determine how many Alpha Linux systems<br>
are out there, since any system could be used for Linux.<br>
<p>
What I thought I said (and what I think that Christopher meant to say) was that<br>
having Linux on the Alpha has actually caused MORE sales of Digital UNIX than<br>
we would have without Linux being on the Alpha. Despite the fact that<br>
some people who *might* have bought Digital UNIX bought Linux instead, I have<br>
had MORE people "discover" Alpha through Linux, then find out that (for one<br>
reason or the other) Digital UNIX was a better choice *for* *their*<br>
*particular* *need*.<br>
<p>
By the way, the fact that Digital currently sells no systems without a license<br>
is constantly in debate, and may change in the future.<br>
<p>
<a href="mailto:cbbrowne@knuth.brownes.org">cbbrowne@knuth.brownes.org</a> said:<br>
<i>&gt; b) The ideal target (from the Digital perspective) for Linux is in </i><br>
<i>&gt; the  aftermarket, allowing "obsolete" hardware to stay in use.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Systems that get  redeployed using Linux are more valuable than </i><br>
<i>&gt; systems that get crushed, which  *reduces the cost of ownership* of </i><br>
<i>&gt; the Digital UNIX systems.  Best of all,  this takes place without </i><br>
<i>&gt; Digital losing any sales dollars or profit margin.   Making the </i><br>
<i>&gt; hardware cheaper to the customers without cutting prices is "a good  </i><br>
<i>&gt; thing." </i><br>
<p>
In my talk, I pointed out that the cost of ownership of a system is based upon<br>
several things, not the least of which is the resale value of older equipment.<br>
Since the port of Linux, the older Alphas have had a new lease on life, and<br>
this helps customers either get more money for their older systems, or extend<br>
the useful life of the Alpha systems inside their own organization.  Likewise<br>
from time to time we have overruns, and the Linux market is a place where<br>
people might like to take advantage of this situation.<br>
<p>
However, to say that it is "the ideal target (from the Digital perspective)"<br>
is not exactly what I wished to convey.  I think that I stressed in this<br>
talk (as I have in others) that I believe turnkey systems (kiosks, reservation<br>
systems, Inter/Intranet services, doctor/dentist/lawyer systems) as well<br>
as education/research are the major markets while the number of desktop<br>
applications builds.  Digital is trying to help with the latter, and that<br>
is why we did the em86 emulator, and why we are glad to see the Alpha<br>
port of the Java language and system proceeding.<br>
<p>
<a href="mailto:cbbrowne@knuth.brownes.org">cbbrowne@knuth.brownes.org</a> said:<br>
<i>&gt; c) People have come to Digital having heard that Alpha was a good </i><br>
<i>&gt; place to run  Linux, and come away concluding they really want DU.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; That's what you call  "unsolicited sales," that are worth a mint.</i><br>
<p>
Absolutely, but I also said that I am just as happy to have sold an Alpha<br>
running Linux as I am to have sold an Alpha running Digital UNIX.<br>
<p>
<a href="mailto:maurice@ellpspace.math.ualberta.ca">maurice@ellpspace.math.ualberta.ca</a> said:<br>
<i>&gt; The truly unfortunate thing that I deduce from this is that therefore </i><br>
<i>&gt; Digital is absolutely not interested in things like improved </i><br>
<i>&gt; libraries for Linux to be used for research purposes. As many who buy </i><br>
<i>&gt; Alpha systems and run Linux want to do exactly that (research) it is </i><br>
<i>&gt; a bit frustrating. </i><br>
<p>
The "truly unfortunate thing" is that Digital is made up of many independent<br>
profit and loss centers that own various intellectual properties.  Not all of<br>
them have bought into the Linux marketplace and (quite frankly) may never do so<br>
since there is no profit *for them* in the marketplace for giving away their<br>
technologies.<br>
<p>
If, for example, the libraries that Maurice refers to were shifted under the<br>
auspices of Digital Semiconductor (who makes and sells the Alpha chips), we<br>
might find that the libraries would be made more available.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, one of the reasons why I am interested in Linux is the<br>
definition and production of libraries to do just what Maurice suggests, and<br>
I would encourage the Linux community to develop libraries even better than<br>
the ones that ship with Digital UNIX.<br>
<p>
<a href="mailto:bheadley@interaccess.com">bheadley@interaccess.com</a> said:<br>
<i>&gt; Okay, but that's weird. When our company bought our Alpha's, we found </i><br>
<i>&gt; out that virtually no-one bought them with Digital UNIX; NT was the </i><br>
<i>&gt; platform of choice. If they want to say they sold more Digital UNIXs </i><br>
<i>&gt; than unit Linux sales, that's fine, but I am suspicious of all </i><br>
<i>&gt; second-hand numbers, and face it, DEC doesn't sell Linux. </i><br>
<p>
We sell a significant number of Digital UNIX systems.  While company policy<br>
states that I can not tell you numbers, I can tell you that we sell more<br>
Digital UNIX Alpha systems than we do either OpenVMS or WNT.  And before you<br>
sneer at the number of OpenVMS systems we sell, remember that we built the<br>
company on OpenVMS.  We still have a huge and loyal customer base for that<br>
product.<br>
<p>
<a href="mailto:khansen@njcc.com">khansen@njcc.com</a> said:<br>
<i>&gt; but DEC was never interested in selling CD-ROMs (or systems) with an </i><br>
<i>&gt; OS they didn't write. When the UDB/Multia was new DEC advertised it </i><br>
<i>&gt; as a low-cost Linux/AXP platfor</i><br>
<p>
In my talk I stated that the current plans for Alpha Linux do not have Digital<br>
selling Linux on their systems for two main reasons:<br>
<p>
	o which Linux distribution would we choose?<br>
	o when would we be able to put it out?<br>
<p>
The first topic (although readers of this list might say "Red Hat, of course)<br>
is one that I have dealt with since the beginning.  I did not want to<br>
discourage any distribution by having Digital ship one particular distribution.<br>
<p>
Or worse yet, bring out our own distribution, which touches on point two.<br>
First of all, if we brought out our own distribution, we would probably be<br>
bringing out kernel 1.2.13 when everyone else was on kernel 2.5.23  This is<br>
not a hit at our engineering staff, but is just the facts of (large) corporate<br>
life.  Secondly if we brought out our own distribution, it might discourage<br>
others from doing their distribution, and from my observations, Linux people<br>
purchase Linux because they LIKE a PARTICULAR distribution.  Slackware<br>
people defend Slackware to the hilt.  Debian people keep criticizing me because<br>
Digital does not mention Debian enough (they will probably find Digital<br>
mentioning it more when there is an Alpha Debian distribution ready and<br>
stable).<br>
<p>
At the present time, I prefer our current strategy (which I helped form):<br>
<p>
	o help the Linux community to do the port<br>
	o rely on the existing distributions to port to Alpha<br>
	o rely on resellers/sales people to match the distribution to the<br>
	  customers' needs<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; I think that DU, as well as a lot of (most?) other "proprietary, </i><br>
<i>&gt; license-encumbered UNIX ports" have features which Linux doesn't </i><br>
<i>&gt; have, and won't have for a least a few years.  Certainly this will be </i><br>
<i>&gt; less and less of an issue as time goes by, but at the moment I can't </i><br>
<i>&gt; see any major Unix OS producer ditching their product for Linux. </i><br>
<p>
Technical issues aside, DU has over 5,000 commercial applications that have<br>
been ported to it.  People need these applications, and until they are<br>
ported to Alpha Linux, they will need (and buy) Digital UNIX.<br>
<p>
And before you say that Digital should "encourage" these vendors to port, I<br>
will tell you that 15 years of commercial operating system development and<br>
deployment shows that only works in a very few cases.  The only thing that<br>
works (and works well) is that the application vendor CUSTOMERS demand a<br>
Linux port, then support that demand with buying Linux copies.  Other methods<br>
of doing this lead do disaster over time.  Trust me, I have the whip marks<br>
on my back over this one.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Outside of solaris, most unices are fairly stagnant.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And inside Solaris, it's too dark to see.  :-)</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Software being stagnant is sometimes good.  New releases of Solaris </i><br>
<i>&gt; break far too many things.  At my last job we had lots of machines </i><br>
<i>&gt; running various versions of Solaris, and it was a pain supporting </i><br>
<i>&gt; them all.  I would really have loved to upgrade them all to SunOS </i><br>
<i>&gt; 4.1.3, or better yet to NetBSD. </i><br>
<p>
Well, I might ask whether "most unices are stagnant" as opposed to WHAT?<br>
<p>
There are some operating systems that are busy trying to catch up to what<br>
UNIX systems have today, but are doing it in a proprietary way (so you<br>
know that I am not talking about Linux).  Do you call these systems<br>
"dynamic" or simply lacking in features?<br>
<p>
In another talk I give, I point out that the Whirlwind project was the<br>
first computer to have "real-time", timesharing, light-pens and a series of<br>
other features that most people consider "modern", and it was developed in<br>
the late 1940s to early 1950s (Jay Forrester and Ken Olsen at MIT).  And I also<br>
point a series of interfaces being added to UNIX under the auspices of POSIX<br>
1003.1b that older "proprietary" systems had years ago, but which UNIX now<br>
enjoys with standard interfaces.<br>
<p>
Yes, Linux is moving ahead very rapidly, but the really *interesting* part will<br>
be those *completely new* (and useful) OS functionalities which appear first<br>
in the Linux community.....<br>
<p>
Warmest regards to all,<br>
