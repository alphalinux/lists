<i>&gt; &gt; Okay, but that's weird. When our company bought our Alpha's, we found out</i><br>

choice.<br>

that's<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; fine, but I am suspicious of all second-hand numbers, and face it, DEC</i><br>
doesn't<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sell Linux.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The one major AXP machine where the availability of Linux saved DEC from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; destroying unsaleable stock has got to be the Multia/UDB, which did not run</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Digital UNIX in the first place. I'm not aware of any other model line</i><br>
where<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the lines were drawn out so clearly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It has already gotten to the point, IMHO, where maintaining proprietary,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; license-encumbered UNIX ports no longer makes sense. Hell, DEC could go the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; mklinux route using their own Mach port from DEC UNIX, and just stick on</i><br>
top<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the linux server! How stable do you think their underlying Mach is by now?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Let's really have some fun in this area.  I work as a consdultant for</i><br>
<i>&gt; Digital and have a lot of knowledge of where they are going.  I know</i><br>
<i>&gt; that Maddog is supposed to be the top of the Unix heap, and he is.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; fact is what was once a mountain is now a molehill.  Digital has sold</i><br>
<i>&gt; nearly everyone of its major Unix products to third party vendors and</i><br>
<i>&gt; has lost key partnerships with other third party vendors, because it</i><br>
<i>&gt; refuses to pay to see the stuff ported to the Alpha.  Examples:</i><br>
<i>&gt; CohesionWorxs was sold to Bentley and Digital Tools no longer has any</i><br>
<i>&gt; products that run on Digital machines.  Unix and VMS are dying at DEC</i><br>
<i>&gt; which is why they even allow the Linux trade.  If they were a truly</i><br>
<i>&gt; viable Unix platform they would not devote time and resources to this</i><br>
<i>&gt; effort.  Digital is banking on NT, not Unix, to take it to its future.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I should have fun answering the mail from this one.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Paul,<br>

I'll have even more fun HP's amazingly in the same place. Articles appear in<br>
various HP-centric rags riding them for going pure NT with the Merced chip.<br>
At the same time, mklinux has just been ported to THEIR hardware, underwritten<br>
by HP. First port, stable enough to compile itself, (and maybe not much more),<br>
is within 5% against HPUX 10 in OSF's benchmarks.<br>
<p>
Being presented with evidence, what do we learn from this? Time to write an NT<br>
personality server for Mach? (gnu-NT)<br>
