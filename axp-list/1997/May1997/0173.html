Sorry, my last off-topic post to this group:<br>

<p>
Yes, but in this instance GeoCities doesn't appear to be doing <br>
anything wrong. If you look at the HTML for the URL in question, <br>
there doesn't appear to be any reference to the list mail address.<br>
<p>
And, if you look at such original headers as the list software preserved, <br>
you'll find another clue that this was a slimebag:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Priority: Urgent</i><br>
<p>
which only spammers seem to use.<br>
<p>
A noted anti-Spam campaigner got a dozen or so of these "warnings" within 2-3 <br>
minutes, all of them cited the same URL as the "warning" to the 'axp-list' <br>
address, but were addressed to different email addresses. None of the<br>
addressees were referenced on the web page 5 minutes ago when I looked..<br>
<p>
Here's what the anti-spam list had to add:<br>
<p>
: This is the "hipcrime" spam package, from one of the biggest whiners on the<br>
: net. This bloke decides to spam as performance art, and picks the title of<br>
: "The Hipcrime Vocab" by Chad C Mulligan (a character in a story by John<br>
: Brunner) to describe his "art".<br>
<p>
: Needless to say he's flamed.<br>
<p>
: He whines that he's not commercial, so it's not spam (yeh, right), and he's<br>
: going to make the Hipcrime spam package the biggest force for free speech on<br>
: the net... nyah nyah nyah!<br>
<p>
: Needless to say Chad Mulligan wouldn't recommend actions that serve to<br>
: *reduce* communications between people. Like spamming.<br>
<p>
<p>
A notorious Spam haven (earthlink.net) has links making reference to <br>
hipcrime.com as the originators responsible for the ActiveAgent crawler that <br>
generated the "warning". But they (hipcrime.com) have no A or MX DNS records.<br>
<p>
Obviously, this still leaves a few copies of the Java agent out there...<br>
<p>
You'll need to talk to the list-owner for this list to get any information<br>
that will enable you to complain to whoever ran the agent and spammed the<br>
list.<br>
<p>
I'm outta here.<br>
