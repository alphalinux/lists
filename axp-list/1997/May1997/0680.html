 I am not sure if a Multia 166 is worth all the pain though. In that case<br>
 you are probably better of with a P133. In the beginning it's fun to patch<br>
 everything to work, but when you want some application to just urn, and you <br>
 can't get it to work because the source generates more warnings then it has<br>
 lines of code, you'll rethink it all :) Then again, I _do_ like my Multia :)<br>
 <br>

<p>
  It's still a lot cheaper compared to a similar Intel, since it has everything<br>
  built in already. (Try buying an Intel 133, with ethernet, soundcard, scsi,<br>
  etc for 995). Though I do recommend to add some ram to it right away. If<br>
  you're taking about the company "ReQuest" in Holland, they ship their Multia<br>
  with the standard 16Mb ram, which is REALLY not even close to being enough<br>
  to run X with Netscape :) I am still annoyed at 32MB. <br>
<p>
  Btw. you might want to try one of the ReQuest offers made through the Dutch<br>
  Unix Users group. It's a bit cheaper then getting it directly from them.<br>
