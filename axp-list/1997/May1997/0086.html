<p>
To keep it to as simple an explanation as possible:<br>

Typical passive termination (Single-ended SCSI):<br>

+5V (termination power, supplied on line 26 by some device(s))<br>

<p>
Please note that this is the termination for each of the 18 signal lines<br>
used by narrow SCSI devices. There are therefore 18 sets of the this at<br>
each end of the SCSI bus. Ground and 5V lines may be (and usually is)<br>
common on these.<br>
<p>
SCSI signals within single-ended cables shall be terminated into a<br>
resistive load with 220 ohms connected to +5 volts and 330 ohms connected<br>
to ground at each end of the cable. All signals on the bus will be driven<br>
using open-collector or three-state drivers.<br>
<p>
In essence we are using a passive circuit to achieve a constant voltage<br>
level for the signals on the lines. Note that in commonly used single-ended<br>
SCSI the signal is only derived from a - signal potential. This limits us<br>
to a maximum of 6 meter total cable length befor signal noise overcomes our<br>
voltage levels.<br>
In higher speed scenarios, such as UltraSCSI where the clock rate of the<br>
signals is doubled, or even higher rate SCSI-2 the maximum effective total<br>
cable length is reduced to about 2 meters total. Some work has been done in<br>
improving cable quality and characteristics to provide a better<br>
signal-to-noise ration on the cables themselves. A good example of this is<br>
silver wire cable with teflon shielding. This allows us to nearly double<br>
effective maximum cable length, albeit at a higher cable cost.<br>
<p>
Active termination uses a feedback circuit with a response time faster than<br>
the signal clock to maintain voltage levels at the appropriate range. Many<br>
modern SCSI devices now incorporate active SCSI termination onboard. These<br>
can be genrally distinguished by the fact that a jumper is used on the<br>
device to enable/disable the device termination. Most of the modern<br>
versions of this work quite well. Unfortunately some may not work as well.<br>
It usually depends on the performance and response of the active<br>
termiantion circuit on the device.<br>
<p>
Where better signal characteristics are demanded, such as in a case where<br>
the bus-length maximum is too limiting for practical purposes,<br>
differeential SCSI devices may be employed. This circuit uses an actual +<br>
signal and - signal line pair for each active line. Passive termination for<br>
differential SCSI is shown as:<br>

A differential signal consists of of two lines, +signal and -signal. A<br>
signal is considered active, asserted, or true when the +signal is more<br>
positive than the -signal and a signal is considered inactive, negated, or<br>
false when the -signal is more positive than the +signal. Each signal shall<br>
be terminated as shown above.<br>
<p>
This differential scheme allow much longer cable lengths (up to 25 meters),<br>
and is far less prone to termination and voltage level problems.<br>
Unfortunately it is not widely used because it demands much greater<br>
consumption of current, thusly it is expensive, and puts more stress on the<br>
computer bus, which has to supply the current when the SCSI interface is<br>
the device providing the power.<br>
<p>
The real problems of termination and signal quality appear very frequently<br>
wqhen we install multiple deives from different vendors on a single-ended<br>
SCSI bus. They all show slightly different characteristics, and all respond<br>
slightly differently. Add to the equation the different lengths of cable<br>
involved, and it is clear that the results may become unpredictable, and in<br>
some cases unusable. Generally the only good way to get a stable SCSI bus<br>
when using larger numbers of devices is to ensure that:<br>
<p>
A) The cables used are of good quality, with good shielding and little<br>
crosstalk. Better external enclosure cables use a configuration with a core<br>
of signal lines surrounded by a layer of ground lines, and another layer of<br>
signal lines surrounding that, and a high-quality grounded shield<br>
surrounding the lot. These cables are easily differentiated from the<br>
cheaper variety by the fact that they are usually 2 to 3 times thicker.<br>
Good cabling should provide a characteristic impedance of 100 ohms, +/-<br>
10%. The total characteristic of all cables used in the SCSI bus should<br>
also comply to this impedance level. To minimize cable signal reflections,<br>
cables within a SCSI bus should be of the same type (not mixed). The<br>
maximum speed and drive capability of the bus will depend upon the quality<br>
of the cable.<br>
<p>
B) Remove the termination resistors from the devices used, and install good<br>
quality active terminators at both ends of the bus.<br>
<p>
C) Ensure that all cables used are as short as is  possible, and that the<br>
total for SCSI-2 FAST (10MB/sec data rate) or faster SCSI standards such as<br>
UltraSCSI use no more than a total of 2 meters (78 inches) in length. In<br>
practice an UltraSCSI (20MB/sec data rate) bus should be kept under 1.5<br>
meters in length, unless teflon cable with silver wires is used.<br>

Sorry for the long letter, but "you asked".<br>
