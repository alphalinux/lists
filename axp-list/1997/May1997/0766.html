Hi everyone,<br>
<p>
we just received a 500 MHz Alpha (21164A CPU) machine from Quant-X,<br>
ARC firmware, with RH 4.0 (!) pre-installed.  Since unfortunately we<br>
had to save money, the machine only has a 4GB IDE drive and an IDE<br>
CD-ROM.  Basically, I am not able to get the machine to work and<br>
start to suspect hardware problems.  I appreciate hints / thoughts<br>
from folks more experienced with Linux on the Alpha platform.<br>
<p>
To make a long story short: <br>
<p>
(1) The machine arrives, boots nicely; I attach it to the network --<br>
this works, so N.B. the machine was up and running for app. 30<br>
minutes.  Then I realize that there are app. 2GB of unused diskspace,<br>
so the next thing I do is to attempt to format this partition (the<br>
partition was already there, but no filesytem).  Immediately after<br>
hitting the RETURN key, the machine freezes, and I had to perform a cold<br>
reboot.<br>
<p>
(2) Upon rebooting, the machine hangs during fsck -- since I<br>
didn't have a 4.0 CD or rescue disk I never got back into the<br>
system.<br>
<p>
(3) I have, however, a RH 4.1 CD, so I try to boot off the CD -- it<br>
simply doesn't work (or, rather, it hangs in a quite early stage) (The<br>
Austrian repr. of Quant-X installed 4.0, shipped me a 4.1 CD, but<br>
warned me that 4.1 doesn't work -- go figure!)<br>
<p>
(4) At this point I decide that I might go directly to 4.1 anyways,<br>
so I try a full install.  The installation always hangs when the<br>
screen says 'checking partitions' (i.e., quite early on)  What<br>
surprises me is that (i) the system mounts the CD-ROM on some<br>
temp. device hdb (I would have expected hdc), then (ii) it <br>
scans disks for partions on hda (i.e. the hard-drive) and this<br>
hdb device; there it hangs.<br>
<p>
(5) In a final attempt, I got 4.2 boot/root floppies and thought<br>
if it works at all, I'll do a ftp install.  This install also<br>
fails, but it fails reproducible either when preparing the<br>
swap space or when formatting the / partition.<br>
<p>
BTW, I always used the pc164 kernel on the boot floppy.<br>
<p>
At this point, I gave up and am beginning to suspect either a<br>
hardware problem in the IDE subsystem or some incompatibility<br>
between the software and the hardware.  I have a reasonable amount<br>
of expertise with Linux on Intel, but none with the Alpha platform,<br>
so it may well be that I did/do something very stupid.  Also,<br>
I have not really read yet the manual, but the 4.1 manual<br>
does not strike me as very detailed.<br>
<p>
In a quick search through the FAQ I didn't discover anything special<br>
regarding IDE drives; the vendor said something that IDE partitions<br>
have to be smaller than 2GB -- even if this were the case, it<br>
doesn't explain the install failures as the root partition was the<br>
first one and had app. 500MB.<br>
<p>
So, I am wondering whether someone has hints or had / has similar<br>
problems, or if you think that I may not be so wrong with my<br>
suspicion of faulty hardware.<br>
<p>
Many thanks in advance,<br>
<p>
Stefan Boresch<br>
