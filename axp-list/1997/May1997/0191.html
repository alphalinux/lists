Paul,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Let's really have some fun in this area.  I work as a consdultant for</i><br>
<i>&gt;Digital and have a lot of knowledge of where they are going.  I know</i><br>
<i>&gt;that Maddog is supposed to be the top of the Unix heap, and he is.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;fact is what was once a mountain is now a molehill.  Digital has sold</i><br>
<i>&gt;nearly everyone of its major Unix products to third party vendors and</i><br>
<i>&gt;has lost key partnerships with other third party vendors, because it</i><br>
<i>&gt;refuses to pay to see the stuff ported to the Alpha.  Examples: </i><br>
<i>&gt;CohesionWorxs was sold to Bentley and Digital Tools no longer has any</i><br>
<i>&gt;products that run on Digital machines.  Unix and VMS are dying at DEC</i><br>
<i>&gt;which is why they even allow the Linux trade.  If they were a truly</i><br>
<i>&gt;viable Unix platform they would not devote time and resources to this</i><br>
<i>&gt;effort.  Digital is banking on NT, not Unix, to take it to its future.</i><br>
<p>
I will not pretend that there are not people inside of Digital that believe<br>
WNT is the future of Digital.  Nevertheless there are also people inside of<br>
Digital that believe UNIX will be around a long time and that we should capture<br>
a significant portion of that market as well.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately for the UNIX market, a lot of people believe that Microsoft<br>
products will be the desktop of the future, with UNIX systems being reserved<br>
for "large servers".  I think that this thought process is shared by a lot<br>
of UNIX vendors, not just Digital.  They look at the growth market of the<br>
UNIX desktop (6-8%) versus the growth market of the WNT desktop (est. at<br>
20-30%) and they make their decisions on that.  If you ask them if<br>
they are going to abandon that 6-8% UNIX growth, the answer is probably "no".<br>
If you ask them where they will make a major investment, it will probably be<br>
WNT (if they are telling the truth).<br>
<p>
My personal feeling is that if the UNIX vendors desert the desktop,<br>
that UNIX is doomed.  Most ISVs will not buy a server system to do software<br>
development, and users will not enjoy the use of UNIX tools on their<br>
invisible server.  Without application development on UNIX workstations,<br>
applications will disappear, and UNIX servers will be doomed.  Java will<br>
help, but I think it will be a long time before CAD applications and databases<br>
are written in Java.<br>
<p>
I think that part of the reason for UNIX's troubles these days is reflected by<br>
going to a university and seeing Microsoft and Apple products on the desks of<br>
99% of the undergraduate student population. Linux can help to stem that tide,<br>
and put UNIX literate graduates back into the marketplace.<br>
<p>
Your point that Digital has sold "most of its UNIX products" was not based<br>
on "UNIX or not UNIX", but on the fact that Digital decided that we were into<br>
too many products.  We could not stretch our resources to continue to do<br>
desktop application development (DECwrite, DECchart, DECpresent) and others.<br>
We sold those products off for a variety of both logistical and financial<br>
reasons.<br>
<p>
I was not privy to our sale of our middleware, but I think that part of it<br>
was probably spawned by the inability of the middleware people to sell to<br>
Digital's competitors a product that was absolutely controlled by Digital.<br>
In order to be successful, middleware must be across EVERY platform, and<br>
as long as it was controlled by Digital, people would not trust us to support<br>
all platforms equally.<br>
<p>
Digital UNIX is not dying.  Our sales increase quarter over quarter<br>
faster than the general UNIX market (which means that Digital is getting<br>
a larger share of the UNIX market).  Do we ship as many units as Sun?  No,<br>
but if this were the criteria for continuing the UNIX business, we would have<br>
stopped 15 years ago.<br>
<p>
The reason why Digital "allows the Linux project" has been stated over and<br>
over again:<br>
<p>
	o it gives visibility of Digital to new markets<br>
	o it helps grow interest in the UNIX market<br>
	o it provides a prototyping arena for new functionality<br>
	o it gives a low-cost platform for education/research<br>
<p>
and many more reasons.  It is a very small investment (by Digital standards)<br>
for potentially a high payback.<br>
<p>
I do not want to start this mailing list to be a discussion of Digital's<br>
business practices, but I felt that I had to answer you.  While you may<br>
"work as a consdultant for Digital", you are not privy to all of the internal<br>
workings and thought processes of our company.  Neither am I, but I tend to<br>
think that I have a better handle on the tempo.<br>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
<p>
