<i>&gt; &gt;It has already gotten to the point, IMHO, where maintaining proprietary,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;license-encumbered UNIX ports no longer makes sense. Hell, DEC could go the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;mklinux route using their own Mach port from DEC UNIX, and just stick on top</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the linux server! How stable do you think their underlying Mach is by now?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think that DU, as well as a lot of (most?) other "proprietary,</i><br>
<i>&gt; license-encumbered UNIX ports" have features which Linux doesn't have,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and won't have for a least a few years.  Certainly this will be less</i><br>
<i>&gt; and less of an issue as time goes by, but at the moment I can't see</i><br>
<i>&gt; any major Unix OS producer ditching their product for Linux.</i><br>
<p>
Indeed.<br>
<p>
Values of DU over Linux include that it offers:<br>
<p>
- C2 security, which it is unlikely that Linux will ever offer.  For some <br>
markets, this is a show-stopper.<br>
<p>
- AdvFS, with the combination of a LVM, Journalling FS, and dynamically <br>
resizable disk partitions.<br>
<p>
At the meeting, some "Linux-philes" commented that Linux was likely to have <br>
this Real Soon Now.  <br>
<p>
Yes, there's a project to build a journalling file system.  (See: <br>
&lt;<a href="http://hp.cso.uiuc.edu/~c-cook/prof/lfs/">http://hp.cso.uiuc.edu/~c-cook/prof/lfs/</a>&gt;.)  Linux will probably have a <br>
full-featured file system significantly before Windows NT has a half-decent <br>
one.  It's not clear that this project is progressing anywhere fast.  The <br>
original prediction was availability in about July '97 of "alpha" code.  The <br>
latest info (last updated in Feb. 97) indicates an availability date "in 1998."<br>
<p>
In short, what people believe may become available and what is actually likely <br>
are probably two different things.  Linux doesn't have AdvFS, and certainly <br>
won't in the next year unless Veritas donates code or something of the sort.<br>
<p>
- DU supports some of the hardware required for building high-availability <br>
systems that just plain aren't in the mainstream of Linux development.<br>
<p>
(Mind you, I've seen the DU kernel crash and burn far more times than I've <br>
seen Linux kernels do so; I'm more than a little dubious of the quality of <br>
some of the code that Digital has released; but it must be said that this was <br>
~2 years ago, and represents the earlier "bad" versions of DU...)<br>
<p>
These three major things are the fundamental stumbling blocks of things not <br>
available for Linux that are needed for large scale "modern" UNIX systems.<br>
