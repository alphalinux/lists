<p>
A lot of the AlphaStation 200s and 255s do not have ARC. They can be <br>
upgraded with some flash chips and the firmware disk, but by default <br>
they do not have ARC loaded. <br>
<p>
Actually I find an Alpha with SRM far more flexible and easier to use <br>
than one with ARC. Booting multiple configurations and checking the <br>
hardware is far better under SRM. And you don't need to create <br>
another stupid partition to hold milo and linload.<br>

<p>
I doubt that the geometry is the problem. Most nearly every disk will <br>
report back the geometry without any conflicts. There are two basic <br>
things that I think are happening here. One, that the disk did not <br>
get the initialization label written to the disk. When you <br>
partitioned the disk, did you use fdisk or minlabel? I have always <br>
have far better results using minlabel. I think that I have only <br>
gotten an install to work once when I use fdisk. I have a disk image <br>
with minlabel and other required programs at <br>
<a href="ftp://ftp.alphapower.com/pub/linux/minlabel.img">ftp://ftp.alphapower.com/pub/linux/minlabel.img</a>. Grab this before you <br>
do the install. <br>
<p>
The second thing that may be happening (although I have never had <br>
time to confirm this) is that not all 8 partitions were filled in. I <br>
created only 3 partitions with one of the first installs under SRM <br>
that I did. The other 5 were blank (not zeroed); I used 'd' to delete <br>
the partition entry. If I remember correctly, I had some bizzarre <br>
results in trying to get the system to boot. I ended up reinstalling <br>
Linux on the machine to get things working. <br>
<p>
I am currently writing an Application Note about installing Linux on <br>
Alphas with SRM. If you would like to get a copy, the give me a yell. <br>
It is still in a first draft form, but it is sufficent to get an <br>
install done. <br>
