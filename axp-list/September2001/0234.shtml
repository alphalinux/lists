<P>
<EM>&gt; It is easy to &quot;do something&quot; about it:
</EM><BR>
<P>If you have the cash
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; stuff skipped here
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; While you are at it, if you have Compaq equipment, I suggest that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should call them up and demand they refund your money, as they devalued
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha machines you bought with their poorly thought out strategy and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; announcements.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would suggest that if you recently purchased Compaq equipment that you
<BR>
find other people that have recently bought Comapq equipment and start a
<BR>
class action lawsuit.  I think what Compaq did with their various FUD
<BR>
annoucements can be considered a &quot;deceptive trade practice&quot;.  INAL (I'm not
<BR>
a lawyer) but I would think that a class action suit would also get the
<BR>
DOJ's attention.  The DOJ is MUCH less interested in anti-competitive
<BR>
behaviour now than it was, they have a lot on their plate at the moment.  I
<BR>
do think that Compaq's giving away the Alpha team may violate previous court
<BR>
rulings, then again INAL.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps a spin off for Alpha can be forced?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A lot of you made purchasing decisions based on statements by Compaq
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regarding the &quot;future of Alpha&quot; and Compaqs commitment to it.
</EM><BR>
<P>As was the case, be it Intel or MS, DEC couldn't protect their own patents
<BR>
or inventions without hireing a BIG team of lawyers.  It looks as if Compaq
<BR>
and Itel are betting that no one has the cash to take them to court.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If so, they lied to you. I suggest you demand your money back.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, stop saying &quot;lied&quot; and start saying &quot;felony violation of the federal
<BR>
statute dot dot dot&quot;, and &quot;deceptive trade practices&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But please, do not blame Red Hat. They had nothing to do with it.
</EM><BR>
<P>RedHat should be in on the suit, as they made some purchases WRT Alpha
<BR>
technology and that technology has been pulled out of the market place
<BR>
because of a questionable merger deal?  Any people in the EU think that the
<BR>
EU anti-monopoly people would have problems with some of this?
<BR>
<P>If you or your company recently (within the last 12 months) purchased Alpha
<BR>
or Alpha related hardware perhaps you should e-mail the list and some
<BR>
enterprising individual can collect the names.  Any state or state funded
<BR>
institutions would be especially important.  A state attorney general tends
<BR>
to take a dim view of a company defrauding it's state of even 5 dolalrs,
<BR>
much less tons more.
<BR>
<P>Whose game?
<BR>
