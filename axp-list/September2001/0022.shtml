<P>I'm still considering what a single threaded application would do on my
<BR>
1.7 GHz P4 with a full compliment of memory.  For those who forgot, I'm
<BR>
still wrestling with my P4 systems that hang on the benchFFT program.
<BR>
<P>Following a tip from Thorsten Koch (thanks, Thorsten), I removed half
<BR>
the RDRAM from my systems (down to 1GB), and 3 of the 4 systems that
<BR>
were hanging before would now finish the program (after about 6.5
<BR>
hours).  One would still hang.  On the systems that ran, I have tested
<BR>
again with full memory, and they would hang again, seemingly at the
<BR>
same place into the program.  Leaving in the other half of the memory
<BR>
that was removed before, the systems would run through.  The other
<BR>
system that still hung, still hangs.
<BR>
<P>On all of them, the BIOS logs have registered numerous single-bit ECC
<BR>
errors, and a few multi-bit ECC errors.  I've always thought that ECC
<BR>
will correct single bits, and detect multi-bit errors, which are fatal.
<BR>
<P>Intel is going to swap out the memory for us, but I don't know if that
<BR>
would really help in light of our test results.
