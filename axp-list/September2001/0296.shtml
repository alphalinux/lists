<EM>&gt; Yes, I saw a few horror stories.  Luckily, this isn't really a production
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system, just a home machine that happens to have a partial mirror on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it, so if it dies, I'm not worried.  But, the partition's contents only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; change once per day and it sure beats a 20 min. fsck :-)

<P>I do not mean to imply that journaled file systems do not have their
<BR>
uses.  But those who will understand them as a license to play rough
<BR>
with file systems are replacement for backups may be for some nasty
<BR>
surprises.
<BR>
<P>BTW - ext3 in its default, &quot;ordered writes&quot;, mode practically prevents
<BR>
accidents with a messed up content of files.  You may loose latest
<BR>
updates on a journal replay but things should be sane.  In its &quot;fast&quot;
<BR>
mode it behaves in this respect like reiserfs.  It also has &quot;full
<BR>
journal&quot; mode which is expected to maintain a complete integrity of data
<BR>
for a price of a drop in a performance and a bigger journal.
<BR>
<P>You would need updated e2fsprogs (the latest one from updates to
<BR>
RH 7.1, i.e. e2fsprogs-1.23-1.7.1, should be ok and just recompile
<BR>
if you have different libraries) and a kernel with a support for it
<BR>
if you want to experiment with ext3.  A big attraction is that you
<BR>
can convert ext2 filesystem to ext3, and back, without redoing the
<BR>
whole filesystem from scratch.  Just use 'tune2fs'.  Also booting
<BR>
an older kernel without ext3 support will simply mount even converted
<BR>
filesystem as ext2 type and will not use journal (but I would think
<BR>
that in an event of an unclean shutdown when you had it mounted as
<BR>
ext2 replaying journal on the next boot would be not a good idea :-).
