<P>
as long as the licenses still hold, there shouldn't be much of an issue
<BR>
there. The SRMs for the different platforms are developed for that platform.
<BR>
API/ Samsung came up with its own SRMs for the UP1xxx series. It was based
<BR>
on another SRM from CPQ, but they had to change quite a bit of it due to the
<BR>
chipset differences between the platforms. You can almost always use older
<BR>
firmware to boot linux, as it is not very dependent on the SRM that you are
<BR>
running. VMS, on the other hand, is tied fairly closely into SRM and that
<BR>
may be more of an issue. but again, when an SRM comes out it is designed to
<BR>
run all the current software/ hardware that's available and supported for
<BR>
the platform.
<BR>
<P>HP not writing firmware will mainly handicap just the future releases of
<BR>
'true' CPQ os's.
<BR>
<P>On the other note, AMD could license the technology from CPQ but who knows
<BR>
what the price is that they will get and if it is an advantage to them.
<BR>
Plus, AMD already licenses the ev6 bus to use as its interconnect between
<BR>
the CPU and its chipsets.

<P><P>With HP being historically so anti-Alpha ( i.e. they would not develop nor
<BR>
distribute printer drivers for Alpha powered NT machines ), and soon they
<BR>
will have the copyrights for SRM, PALcode, etc.
<BR>
<P>Even though API and Samsung have license to manufacture and develop Alpha
<BR>
processors and motherboards, how are new machines going to boot if (when) HP
<BR>
refuses to write firmware?
<BR>
<P><P>now an Intel/Compaq thought...
<BR>
Considering the Intel licensing agreement was &quot;non-exclusive&quot;, should AMD
<BR>
also license Alpha technology for their upcoming &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; product
<BR>
line?
