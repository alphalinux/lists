<EM>&gt; To date, I have still not seen or heard ANYTHING from Intel implying that

<EM>&gt; technology
</EM><BR>
<P>compaq has never said that the architecture of IA64 will be changing
<BR>
either.  some people not speaking for compaq have suggested that intel
<BR>
will incorporate alpha architectural features into IA64.  however that is
<BR>
wishful thinking.  i've heard no indication from anyone that intel plans
<BR>
to directly use any of the alpha technology they have licensed.  really,
<BR>
they just wanted (read: badly needed) the alpha engineers in order to
<BR>
produce a fast implementation of the IA64 architecture.  they bothered to
<BR>
license the technology so that the ex-alpha engineers would be free to
<BR>
reuse any good aspects of it in their new design.  the alpha-inspired IA64
<BR>
is expected to come out at about the same time as EV8 would have (not for
<BR>
a number of years yet).  in the mean time the industry will suffer through
<BR>
several lackluster implementations of the IPF.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; -- only from the Compaq folks... who want us to belive that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything they told us about Alpha before was wrong and that we should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; belive them now.
</EM><BR>
<P>a lot of people are saying a lot of things, especially with HP on top of
<BR>
it all.  anybody who claims to know what is really going to happen is flat
<BR>
out wrong, imho.
<BR>
<P>one thing is almost certain however.  whatever does transpire will be bad
<BR>
for alpha linux :(
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;-ross, who is going to wait and see (and is speaking only for himself :)
