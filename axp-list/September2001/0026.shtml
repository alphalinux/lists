<P>I'm using 850 GB boards, which have 4 slots.  They were integrated for

me before I got them, so I don't know if they were covered.

<P>After removing half the memory, 3 of the 4 systems ran without hanging,
<BR>
but one still hung up.  So I can believe that one may have some HW
<BR>
problems.  However, on the other 3, I've swapped memory in and out, and
<BR>
the symptoms are the same; if they have 2GB (all 4 slots filled), they
<BR>
will hang, while any combination of simms in just the first 2 slots (1GB)
<BR>
would let the systems run the benchmark.  Bus loading problem or bad
<BR>
memory?
