<P>
With regards to your message at 01:36 PM 10/26/01, Peter Watkinson. Where 
<BR>
you stated:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Now the enquirer is quoting the email that was posted to this list earlier
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the day
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;<A HREF="http://www.theinquirer.net/26100110.htm">http://www.theinquirer.net/26100110.htm</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Well Maurice Chris and anyone from RH whats the scope?
</EM><BR>
I don't know.
<BR>
I have been releasing info in the hope of finding out.
<BR>
We are a Beta Red Hat site, but this time, unlike in the past, we have not 
<BR>
received a beta for 7.2
<BR>
Further, we were placing orders to book more boxed 7.2, and Tim told me 
<BR>
what I quoted.
<BR>
<P>As we have seen from the info discussed here, Alpha is not commercially 
<BR>
viable for Red Hat to support, unless a corporate, such as Compaq, 
<BR>
underwrites it.
<BR>
<P>Apparently Compaq people seem to think that this is still happening, but if 
<BR>
so, nobody seems to have made that commitment sufficiently clearly for Red 
<BR>
Hat to act on so far.
<BR>
<P>And that is all I know so far.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Bearing in mind what Christopher said about EV7 does anyone know if Samsung
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;has plans to develop motherboards for Linux and EV7?
</EM><BR>
Samsung has developed the UP1500 (EV68)
<BR>
After that, I doubt it.
<BR>
<P>I have heard of a private initiative to build a third party board, and I 
<BR>
hear that a certain US company is producing a DP264 &quot;clone&quot;
<BR>
<P>We are pursuing the Asian third party boards actively, and we do have 
<BR>
sourcing on UP1500 in place.
<BR>
<P>API is apparently moving it's support to another location soon, and I 
<BR>
believe announcements to that effect will release shortly.
<BR>
<P>Compaq still builds Alphas, and will do so for the foreseeable future.
<BR>
<P>And that is about the sum of what is known so far.
<BR>
<P><P>
<P>With our best regards,
<BR>
