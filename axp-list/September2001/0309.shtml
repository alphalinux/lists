<EM>&gt; Michal&gt; into other kernel structures and it may be not very surprising
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Michal&gt; to see yet a more thorough rewrite of it, or two.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Uhm, uhm, uhm.  A rewrite?  Why would we rewrite it?
</EM><BR>
<P>To better fit with the rest of the kernel.  I recall quite distincly
<BR>
suggestions of that sort from some people who will have some say
<BR>
in matters of a final acceptance.  Myself I have none.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The XFS core code is identical between Linux and IRIX.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, but we are talking here mostly about &quot;impendance on connections&quot;.
<BR>
I hear (mind you, I hear!) that right now, for example, it is
<BR>
non-trivial to have at once both ext3 and xfs support.  An issue of xfs
<BR>
going &quot;too deep&quot; into other structures was mentioned on linux-kernel
<BR>
list quite a few times.  Again this really will be not up to me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Michal&gt; There are people using both but they are not recommended in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Michal&gt; this moment for a &quot;production&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sorry, that's just FUD.  There are plenty of people out there using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; XFS on production systems.
</EM><BR>
<P>FUD yourself.  You may notice that &quot;production&quot; above was in quotes.
<BR>
As long as this is not a part of standard kernel sources there could be
<BR>
changes and if are using that you may expect surprises, better know what
<BR>
you are doing and be prepared to solve troubles yourself.  The fact that
<BR>
there are numerous sites using xfs for serious tasks is great and a part
<BR>
of a regular development process in Linux.  But folks not willing to get
<BR>
hands dirty from time to time better stay away.
<BR>
<P>If you suggest that xfs is likely to become a part of a standard kernel
<BR>
in 2.4 series then you know something which I did not hear yet.  OTOH
<BR>
personally I would rather trust my data to xfs than to reiserfs - but
<BR>
these are my private opinions.
