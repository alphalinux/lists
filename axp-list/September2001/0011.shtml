<EM>&gt;&gt;   OK, there ARE no winners in this mess..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   well maybe Intel. It got alpha technology from CPQ, and a bunch of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   development effort on Itanium from HP. Now since both are merging....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   whoohoo! only one company to deal with and one stop shopping for high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   performance chip design and a major part of the itanium development team.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Especially if you look at it from the point of view:
<BR>
A) Intel has eliminated competition from the Alpha
<BR>
B) Intel has knocked AMD's competive position  for a loop.
<BR>
<P>CPQ was a big AMD buyer just recently. I doubt that neither HP nor the
<BR>
&quot;We're all Intel all the way&quot; announcements from CPQ will tolerate that in
<BR>
the future.
<BR>
<P>So it's looking like performace choices are now limited to IBM's PowerPC 
<BR>
(formerly known as Power) and Intel's IA64.
<BR>
<P>To date, I have still not seen or heard ANYTHING from Intel implying that
<BR>
they intend to change the design of the IA64 to make use of Alpha
<BR>
technology -- only from the Compaq folks... who want us to belive that
<BR>
everything they told us about Alpha before was wrong and that we should
<BR>
belive them now.
<BR>
<P>Next week at CETS2001 in Anaheim should be interesting.
