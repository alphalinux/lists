<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ehhh ... I'd doubt this is a kernel problem. I'm thinking either cache
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; or memory.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Indeed, have you tried swapping out the memory? You may also want to try
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; re-seating the SlotBs and the Dimms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've had the memory in so many different configurations that I've developed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; calluses on my fingertips from fiddling with them so much.  Unfortunately,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I couldn't narrow down which module was causing the problem.  The machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would only boot if all 8 256 MB modules were in there.  This, to say the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; least, was very confusing.  I gave up after the manufacturer said it was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the kernel...
</EM><BR>
Hi,
<BR>
on my PC164, there is a jumper I have to set in order to be able to run with 
<BR>
4 modules only. Or let's say, I had to remove it in order to put 8 modules in 
<BR>
;-)
<BR>
&nbsp;But for what is 2.4.x, I also gave up on it. Too many hang-ups on my 
<BR>
machine. And, although different people gave different reasons, I never 
<BR>
managed to get it running. Some heavy net-traffic still gets it down 
<BR>
(2.4.12-ac2). So since I saw that 2.2.19 also has usb-scanner support (my 
<BR>
main reason for 2.4), I switched back. So far no problems anymore...
