<P>
With regards to your message at 03:03 AM 10/26/01, Peter Bech. Where you 
<BR>
stated:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;seem something is going on....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
First off, it appears there is some confusion here, and maybe Compaq and 
<BR>
Red Hat are not doing such a good job of communicating lately. I also 
<BR>
received more info earlier this week, but was debating on passing it on, as 
<BR>
I did not want to discourage people. I did some more digging and called up 
<BR>
a few people at Red Hat to confirm what I was being told, and nobody there 
<BR>
could deny or confirm it, so this is still a bit &quot;up in the air&quot;
<BR>
I DO want to point out that this message posted to axp list as quote in the 
<BR>
following is &quot;supposed&quot; to be confidential. Read the header message, for 
<BR>
goodness sake!
<BR>

<EM>&gt;  ABSTRACT: Recently, The Inquirer erroneously reported that Red Hat was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  dropping support for Alpha in its release stream and that there would be no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Red Hat 7.2 for the Alpha processor.  &quot;This is totally untrue,&quot; according to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Alanna Dwyer of the Compaq Linux Program Office. &quot;
</EM><BR>
<P><P>And what I heard from the Red Hat commercial products contact, Mr. Tim 
<BR>
Spinks, differs quite a bit from this.
<BR>
I quote the message thread between Tim and myself:

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;Maurice,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;I have spoken to product management and the plan is not to have any more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;Alpha releases. Compaq has always worked very close with Red Hat to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;develop the Alpha release. From a demand stand point the quantities were 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;alsways low so Compaq would commit to certain volumes to allow us to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;continue developmental work. I'm guessing that is no longer the case. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;Red Hat wants to port to as many chip sets as possible it helps 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;facilitate migration to Linux, but in todays economy if the revenues 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;cannot support the cost to do the ports we are pulling back on those 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;plans. I know this is not the answer you want but as discussions 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;continue with Compaq  things may change.  They are also discussing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;updates to new releases.  We have good inventories of 7.1 so you should 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;be able to buy that for some time to come.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;Tim
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Thanks for clearing that up, TIm.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;I wonder of you can help me out with something, then:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;We see that the Rawhide tree for Alpha is still very active.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Would Red Hat mind if we built, used, and sold a distro based on this?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Technically this is GPL, but I still want to ask, from the point of view 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;of courtesy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;I think that we, and a few other Alpha commercial and non-commercial 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;entities may want to keep the Red Hat based distro &quot;alive&quot; for a while yet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;The other thought is &quot;How much would it cost to pick up where Compaq left 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;off on funding this?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;I realize you may not be in a position to answer these questions, so if 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;you wish to direct me to another person at Red Hat on this, I understand&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;BTW, how much of this information is covered under NDA?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Thanks for all your help, Tim.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Maurice,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;None of what I have told you needs to be  NDA but is early discussions 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about the future plans of Alpha. I would not take any of this as the final 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;say nor worth repeating to the masses yet. I have sent on your message to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;product management to let them know your concerns. I appreciate that. Do 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you know who you are working with on Alpha beta? We may want to ping them 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for the most up to date info.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Tim
</EM><BR>
<P>So, as one can see, it appears the left and right hands do not know what 
<BR>
each is doing, at least at Compaq.
<BR>
All I know is that we are trying to buy copies of Red Hat 7.2 for Alpha, 
<BR>
and are stymied so far..
<BR>
We shipped well over a hundred copies of 7.1 Alpha in the last month, and 
<BR>
are hoping for more in 7.2 release.
<BR>
<P>If anyone else has any info or insights into this I could sure use them..
