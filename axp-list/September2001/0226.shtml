What Ron says is true.  The context of the discussion was in trying to get
<BR>
some updates to potato (aka &quot;stable&quot;) built on Alpha.  Since I only own
<BR>
one Alpha and it's currently running unstable, I couldn't build the
<BR>
packages locally.  Also, the two Alphas that are either on-loan or donated
<BR>
to Debian have been down for months with no replies on what went wrong or
<BR>
when I can help someone get them up again.  I wanted to use this
<BR>
coincidence to force the issue and got that rather shocking (and
<BR>
sudden) reply.  It's since been diffused in private mail, fyi, and steps
<BR>
are being taken to get at least one of those two machines relocated to a
<BR>
place where it can be taken care of properly.  In all fairness, the normal
<BR>
Debian project machine admins don't know anything about alpha, so I don't
<BR>
blame them, but I would've welcomed a long phone call to help solve the
<BR>
situation.
<BR>
<P>In short, woody's path continues strongly and we're definitely not
<BR>
dropping Alpha (if that were the case, I would definitely start a
<BR>
flame-fest on the Debian private lists since I pour a TON of time into
<BR>
making sure Alpha is just as well supported as x86 with Debian).  Current
<BR>
Debian unstable (aka &quot;sid&quot;) is also going very well, in case anyone's
<BR>
interested.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Before we all go &quot;leaping&quot; to Deb, I think you might want to read an

<EM>&gt; That was a reply regarding both of the Alpha project machines being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; down. It was by no means an official statement. The Alpha port is NOT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to be dropped. It was more of a scare tactic to get the machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; admins to do something about them. If you look here
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://buildd.debian.org/stats/graph.png">http://buildd.debian.org/stats/graph.png</A>&gt; you'll see the Alpha port is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keeping up just fine with x86.
