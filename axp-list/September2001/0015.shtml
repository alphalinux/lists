<EM>&gt; now an Intel/Compaq thought...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Considering the Intel licensing agreement was &quot;non-exclusive&quot;, should AMD
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also license Alpha technology for their upcoming &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; product
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; line?

<P>To give you some idea where Intel are heading:
<BR>
<P>At its Intel Developers Forum late last month, the giant
<BR>
chipmaker showed off a Pentium 4 running at an impressive
<BR>
3.5GHz. But then an Intel executive came out and said that,
<BR>
while the speed will always be important, people are more
<BR>
interested in performance. Paul Otellini, GM of the Intel
<BR>
Architecture Group, then challenged hardware and software
<BR>
developers to come out with technology that is useful to
<BR>
their customers, telling them, &quot;During a downturn, companies
<BR>
tend to lose focus on what people want.&quot;
<BR>
<P>That said, Otellini then unveiled a technology called
<BR>
hyperthreading, which holds a lot of promise for businesses
<BR>
that want to boost the performance and power of their CPU
<BR>
systems. In short, hyperthreading is a way of fooling
<BR>
applications into thinking a single processor is actually
<BR>
two separate ones.
<BR>
<P>The result could be up to a 30 percent improvement in the
<BR>
performance of a single processor, a huge boost for
<BR>
companies looking for more power without having to add
<BR>
chips. It could immediately benefit Web servers by ramping
<BR>
up the number of Web transactions, and Intel executives said
<BR>
they were interested in moving the technology onto the
<BR>
desktop.
<BR>
<P>Consider what a Hyperthreaded 3.5Ghz P4 could do in terms of
<BR>
workload. Also, I think EV8 had SMT, Symetric Multi-Threading.
<BR>
Sounds similar which would be a good reason to get Alpha
<BR>
engineers.
