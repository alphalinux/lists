<EM>&gt; Do you have references you can cite on the problems people have had 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with reiserfs?  Are these problems with some of the earlier versions?  
</EM><BR>
<P>My sources consists mostly from what I read on linux-kernel mailing
<BR>
list where reports &quot;reiserfs ate my filesystem&quot;, or &quot;my filesystem
<BR>
is ok but data are screwed&quot; are pretty standard if not really everyday
<BR>
fare.  It is true that after numerous bug fixes, rewrites and format
<BR>
changes (Chris Mason did a lot of an excellent work) their frequency
<BR>
now seem to be lower.  ReiserFS until quite recently was also unusable
<BR>
with NFS.  This is supposedly currently fixed but personally I would
<BR>
be very careful in this respect unless this is used on scratch and
<BR>
experimental systems.  After what I have seen ReiserFS does not give
<BR>
me much confidence for now.  There are numerous reports of &quot;works for
<BR>
me&quot; kind.  That is fine but if bugs hit only in some &quot;weird&quot; usage
<BR>
patterns there is no guarantee that my usage will not turn out to
<BR>
be &quot;weird&quot;.
<BR>
<P>It is also quite unfortunate that <A HREF="http://www.reiserfs.org">http://www.reiserfs.org</A> contains much
<BR>
hype, and claims that raise alarm flags, but it is hard (possible at
<BR>
all?) to find there a hard technical information.  In particular my
<BR>
information that reiserfs journals only metadata, by design, comes
<BR>
not from any ReiserFS documents but from peple whom I believe have
<BR>
some pretty good idea what they are talking about.
