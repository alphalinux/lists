<EM>&gt; Are you working on a 7.2 CD?  The 7.1 CD was excellent.

<EM>&gt; It's NOT good, it wont boot on the AS800: It costs 120 Euro (including

<EM>&gt; shipment) -&gt; not usable -&gt; garbage can.

<EM>&gt; This is the first time in my entire IT life (since 1966) I have purchased an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operating system, that cannot boot itself. This is the first time in my entire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life I have purchased an &quot;update&quot; that cannot update my previous version.

<P>Humm I guess you'd want an explaination then
<BR>
Ok. The way it goes is this. I have limited Alpha HW to play with. Specifically a
<BR>
4way ES40, a couple of UP2000's, a DS20, DS10, DS10L, sx164(personal) and a
<BR>
rather sickly Nautilus (which I'm not convinced has a fully working motherboard).
<BR>
<P>I was given the priorities
<BR>
1. Make it work on es40 and ds20
<BR>
2. Make it work on as much of the ev6 line as you can get your hands on
<BR>
3. Make it resemble the 7.1 intel release as much as possible
<BR>
4. Make it install headless (ie on serial)
<BR>
5. Kill as many of the unaligned trap errors as possible
<BR>
6. Try and support ev56
<BR>
7. Any other hardware you can lay your hands on.
<BR>
<P>(Oh and wrapper all that in a 4 month timeframe)
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately I, plain and simple, only have so much kit to play with and the
<BR>
AS800 is not a machine I have here.
<BR>
<P>I'm sorry guv, but I can only do so much with the limited resources and I'm sorry
<BR>
that you got bitten
<BR>
