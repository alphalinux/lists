<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Uhm, uhm, uhm.  A rewrite?  Why would we rewrite it?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>Michal&gt; To better fit with the rest of the kernel.  I recall quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>Michal&gt; distincly suggestions of that sort from some people who will
</EM><BR>
<EM>Michal&gt; have some say in matters of a final acceptance.  
</EM><BR>
<P>We have a slim layer mapping between Linux VFS and what the core XFS
<BR>
code thinks is the IRIX vnode layer.  That's what Al dislikes.
<BR>
<P>And while I mostly share his opinion, ripping linvfs out and teaching
<BR>
XFS to talk directly to Linux' VFS would not only be a big task.  It
<BR>
would also mean throwing away hundreds of man-years of development,
<BR>
testing, and QA that SGI has put into the filesystem.
<BR>
<P>And that is simply not worth the effort.  A stable filesystem is more
<BR>
important.  Plus SGI is obviously interested in sharing code base
<BR>
between IRIX and Linux.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>Michal&gt; I hear (mind you, I hear!) that right now, for example, it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>Michal&gt; non-trivial to have at once both ext3 and xfs support.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Not true.  There's an export symbol conflict and that's it.
<BR>
<P>I have both on my machine right here.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>Michal&gt; An issue of xfs going &quot;too deep&quot; into other structures was
</EM><BR>
<EM>Michal&gt; mentioned on linux-kernel list quite a few times.  
</EM><BR>
<P>A few points I'd like to make:
<BR>
<P>Chances are that people making statements like that haven't looked at
<BR>
the patches recently.
<BR>
<P>XFS used to have a bigger footprint, yes.  When we started the
<BR>
project we kept joking about porting Linux to XFS.  And to some
<BR>
extent that turned out to be the case.  XFS is by far the most
<BR>
advanced Linux filesystem out there.  And it has feature requirements
<BR>
beyond what currently Linux offers.
<BR>
<P>SGI has been actively participating in the kernel development process
<BR>
in order to add the required functionality to the generic kernel.
<BR>
Most of the things XFS needs are now part of 2.4 as a result of this.
<BR>
And the process is ongoing.  We're helping define a common interface
<BR>
for access control lists and extended attributes, for instance.
<BR>
<P>The single big XFS feature Linux is missing right now is support for
<BR>
delayed allocations in the VM.  And that's where the bulk of our
<BR>
changes are.  None of the other filesystems on Linux support delayed
<BR>
allocations yet, so there's no infrastructure to support it.  But I
<BR>
know that at least the reiser folks are interested in adding support
<BR>
to their filesystem.
<BR>
<P>So when you see comments about ``XFS going too deep into other
<BR>
structures'' it usually means ``Linux doesn't have feature XYZ yet''.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>Michal&gt; If you suggest that xfs is likely to become a part of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>Michal&gt; standard kernel in 2.4 series then you know something which I
</EM><BR>
<EM>Michal&gt; did not hear yet.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, who knows?  Right now a stable VM is the primary target...
<BR>
