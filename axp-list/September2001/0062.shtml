<P>
&quot;It's not difficult to predict, especially about the future&quot; was said by a 
<BR>
Danish guy some 70 years ago.
<BR>
<P>Today I read a &quot;summary&quot; in the Danish version of Computerworld that &quot;.. Compaq 
<BR>
has Tru64 Unix on Alpha, NonStop Kernel on MIPS and OpenVMS on VAX...&quot;
<BR>
<P>That's what the IT-press knows about the glorius purchases of Tandem and 
<BR>
Digital some years ago.
<BR>
<P>And that tells what Compaq has done to it: Forgot it in their struggle for 
<BR>
retaining their no. one PC position which they lost anyway.
<BR>
<P>I thought, that the Compaq marketing combined with the strong innovation and 
<BR>
engineering of DEC would become a smahing hit. There you see how wring one can 
<BR>
be.
<BR>
<P>Fortunately, HP knows much more about former DEC than Compaq did and does. I'm 
<BR>
pretty sure, they (HP) know exactly, what they have purchased. The DEC part of 
<BR>
Compaq and HP are companies very much alike.
<BR>
<P>So the only thing that puzzles me, is why Compaq got rid of Alpha in june. Was 
<BR>
this part of the plan together with HP?
<BR>
<P>And if yes, why?
<BR>
<P>Rgds
