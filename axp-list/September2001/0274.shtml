<P><EM>&gt; OK we've seen about Itanium and how much that costs how about the AMD Hammer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what I've heard is that it should debut in 1H 02 and be clocked at about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2ghz. Will it run x86 linux out of the box or will it need it's own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distribution? Has anyone any idea what it will cost? Does anyone know what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the projected Spec or other Benchmark figures are?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;From what I've seen so far, Hammer will be able to run current x86-32
</EM><BR>
Linux out of the box.  Kernel changes area already being made inside AMD
<BR>
for supporting the new instructions (so I've heard, at least).  Current
<BR>
toolchains do not have support for the Hammer line, though, so until the
<BR>
new &quot;extended extended&quot; register naming scheme changes are in the various
<BR>
toolchain CVS trees, I doubt anyone will be able to actually compile for a
<BR>
Hammer native target from any non-low-level language (shouldn't take that
<BR>
long to get that support in, fyi).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now that Alpha seems to be swimming with the fishes we'll have to consider
</EM><BR>
<P>Ugh...here we go.  I still haven't heard the proverbial &quot;fat lady&quot; singing
<BR>
yet (nor has Elvis left the building).  Alphas are still being shipped and
<BR>
made and EV7 is still slated...it's just after that point where things are
<BR>
unclear.  Re-read the Compaq-Intel PRs...they're a lot less clear about
<BR>
what exactly was &quot;sold&quot; to Intel.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; the alternatives and Hammer seems to me like it has the most similarity to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Alpha  - or maybe it just appeals because it's not made by Intel!
</EM><BR>
<P>Probably the latter.  I think the Hammer is quite interesting, but not
<BR>
revolutionary (IA-64 is quite a bit more revolutionary, but the problems
<BR>
are more grounded in reality and practice than concept).  In the end,
<BR>
though, Hammer should do very well and should boast some impressive
<BR>
numbers.
