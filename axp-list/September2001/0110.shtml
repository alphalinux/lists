</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Just wondering if anyone had any luck with building OpenOffice.  I have had a number of people contact me saying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they'd like to help and even more asking if we'd had any luck.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A couple people were also asking questions about compile problems.  Unfortunately, I was no help since I don't have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the disk space to try it myself.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I should have disk space to try it soon.  However, I'm not very confident that if I run into any problems that I will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be able to work through them.  If anyone has the ability, A LOT of people would appreciate your efforts.
</EM><BR>
<P>I tried build 638 IIRC, and it didn't work out very well.
<BR>
First, one of the scripts assumes you don't make your
<BR>
C-shell safe, so it didn't create one of the files.  Then,
<BR>
dmake was producing compilation commands that were missing
<BR>
the first few words.  I plan to try again if/when I get
<BR>
some time.
