<P>
Michal,
<BR>
<P>Do you have references you can cite on the problems people have had 
<BR>
with reiserfs?  Are these problems with some of the earlier versions?  
<BR>
I have not heard of any problems recently.
<BR>
<P>I am also aware of the other journaling filesystems available (ext3, 
<BR>
jfs (IBM), xfs (SGI)), but until these are in the kernel proper, I am 
<BR>
not interested in patching.  Are their plans to include any of these in 
<BR>
the kernel?  These may be better also and I have some good experiences 
<BR>
with both AIX and IRIX.
<BR>
<P>I also do daily backups on these systems with AMANDA.  So far though, I 
<BR>
have had absolutely no problems with reiserfs on either Intel or Alpha.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for the info...

<EM>&gt; &gt; Yes, I saw a few horror stories.  Luckily, this isn't really a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; production system, just a home machine that happens to have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; partial mirror on it, so if it dies, I'm not worried.  But, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; partition's contents only change once per day and it sure beats a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 20 min. fsck :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I do not mean to imply that journaled file systems do not have their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; uses.  But those who will understand them as a license to play rough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with file systems are replacement for backups may be for some nasty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surprises.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BTW - ext3 in its default, &quot;ordered writes&quot;, mode practically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prevents accidents with a messed up content of files.  You may loose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; latest updates on a journal replay but things should be sane.  In its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;fast&quot; mode it behaves in this respect like reiserfs.  It also has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;full journal&quot; mode which is expected to maintain a complete
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; integrity of data for a price of a drop in a performance and a bigger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; journal.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You would need updated e2fsprogs (the latest one from updates to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RH 7.1, i.e. e2fsprogs-1.23-1.7.1, should be ok and just recompile
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you have different libraries) and a kernel with a support for it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you want to experiment with ext3.  A big attraction is that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can convert ext2 filesystem to ext3, and back, without redoing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whole filesystem from scratch.  Just use 'tune2fs'.  Also booting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an older kernel without ext3 support will simply mount even converted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; filesystem as ext2 type and will not use journal (but I would think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that in an event of an unclean shutdown when you had it mounted as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ext2 replaying journal on the next boot would be not a good idea :-).
