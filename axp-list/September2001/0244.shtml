<P>
It's my understanding that the RH/Compaq/Alpha relationship is not over and
<BR>
that both parties are working to agree on the best approach to support
<BR>
going forward. It might be worth waiting to hear what they have to say
<BR>
before giving much consideration to any talk of litigation.
<BR>
<P>In addition, the extra-ordinary growth in Linux over the past several years
<BR>
is doubtfully the result of the performance superiority of Alpha. It's a
<BR>
contributing factor; however, marginal at best given the number of other
<BR>
platforms RH is ported to. This begs the question of how much real revenue
<BR>
RH might have ever seen as a direct result of Alpha.
<BR>
<P>The two are a perfect match, but because many preferred the lower price
<BR>
point of x86 products, and never did the testing on Alpha to determine if
<BR>
the architecture was better suited from a price/performance perspective,
<BR>
the number of systems shipped never reached a level required to sustain the
<BR>
engineering costs. Pure and simple, if the revenue had been there, and it
<BR>
had been profitable, we'd be in a different situation today.
<BR>
<P>But I find it hard to believe we can blame Compaq for this. Poor
<BR>
marketing..yes...but business managers make buying decisions for a variety
<BR>
of reasons. If a manager knows Alpha has offered higher performance levels
<BR>
with similar or lower pricing, and the major applications on Alpha can save
<BR>
their company $$, and they choose the easy road, you can't blame this on
<BR>
DEC or Compaq.
<BR>
<P>It's a great architecture...just too bad the vocal support for it was never
<BR>
this obvious until the Itanium announcement. Again, I'm hopeful the
<BR>
Compaq/RH announcement will offer a better picture than we've been hearing
<BR>
so much about recently.
<BR>
<P>best regards

<EM>&gt;&gt;Huh? what did RHAT buy?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Working with my VERY bad &quot;slave's memory&quot; here is what I'm thinking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I believe that RHAT bought a small software development company with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expertise in 64 bit development, specifically for the Alpha (Someone help me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;here my brain is mush)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'd be willing to bet that not all the alpha hardware that RHAT has was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;donated.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;RH partnered with Compaq on the Alpha Cluster, Enterprise toolkit and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Deluxe edition of the of the Alpha boxed set which included various Compaq
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tools.  Compaq's discoing has devalued those products and made Rat's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;position more difficult in regards to supporting them.  If there are any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;memorandums of understanding between RHAT and Compaq, they may need to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reviewed in light of recent events.  In fact I would probably guess a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lawyer would say ANY agreement between the 2 companies should be reviewed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;RH certificates where also excepted internally for Compaq/API training.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(how does this affect anything, i don't know INAL)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;I'm just the lowly scum of the earth developer that never gets told
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;other than &quot;work harder/faster slave&quot; I'm interested.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In management you can still be treated like a mushroom.

<EM>&gt;Daniel Potts &lt;danielp@cse.unsw.edu.au&gt; said
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Why not save your money and use it for a licence and engineers to make an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Alpha CPU and system. That way you don't need to deal with Compaq FUD and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;aren't wasting your money with law suits that will only waste time and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;result in the Alphas demise anyway.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Because personally I'm interested in a good alternative to the x386 entirely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and because of my background in Physics and the analysis required when I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a student the alpha has always struck me as a good sound fast processor.  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I get a licence and some good engineers i'd probably have to contend with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Intel lawsuits right off the bat, sad but I don't put much/any faith in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;what a company like Compaq may be liscencing in light of their recent deeds.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Our Alphas didn't suddenly devalue because of these announcements. Last I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;checked, they were still running at the same speed, computing at a rate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;that they were when we bought them. The software we run on them didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Some software sources as recently mentioned on the list did dry up.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Development has stopped for others.  Some hardware drivers magically stopped
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;being supported from what I understand (that is rumor and hearsay, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fairly reliable University source)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;suddenly stop working.. you get the idea. People that rely on any one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;architecture to run their code are asking for trouble and those people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;that really need Alpha for running their applications because they have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;lost the source code or think the porting effort is too large, wake up, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;is your own fault.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I test and run all my code on Alpha before I port it to another machine.  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it's not 64 bit clean then it's not &quot;good code&quot;.  I've been doing that since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I had my first alpha machine running a distro of Linux called craftworks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The problem is that for some really intensive calculations nothing beat an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Alpha.  That is why some people are so fond of the architecture.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;To be honest in the end, it's about holding companies accountable when they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do something illegal.  If they get away with it, then they will try again,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and I'm not much of a fan of letting any entity large or small break the law
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with impunity.
