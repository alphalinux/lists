</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;If one of the resources is critical then it already got initialized. 
<BR>
That is it does not conflict (overlap) with any other or the system
<BR>
wouldn't function (couldn't use the device).  Thus it need not be
<BR>
changed.  If certain resources conflict with one another (likely due to
<BR>
power-on defaults) they are all unusable and may certainly be
<BR>
reinitialized anyhow. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Besides, i386 code can't handle uninitialized PCI-PCI bridges. At all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe the main reason why i386 port doesn't use &quot;setup PCI yourself&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; approach is that there are lots and lots of various x86 host-to-pci bridges,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and very few of them are documented.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;Actually classic PCI-PCI bridges (e.g. DEC's 21x5x) are very rare in i386
<BR>
systems, although it might be worth checking how often they get properly
<BR>
initialized by firmware (I don't have a card with a bridge to test,
<BR>
unfortunately).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;More frequent are peer host bridges, such as the one included in the
<BR>
i450KX/GX chipset or all AGP chipsets.  Most if not all Intel chipsets are
<BR>
documented sufficiently, others might not.  But there is usually no need
<BR>
to configure them -- they are not standard PCI devices with explicit
<BR>
resources.  They usually hardwire the address range they decode to devices
<BR>
that are directly attached to them (mainly the host's memory).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Other devices need resource allocation as usual and that happens either
<BR>
directly using PCI configuration space accesses or via firmware calls,
<BR>
which also use configuration accesses but may be needed if a host bridge
<BR>
is not documented sufficiently enough.  It's even quite likely to see PCI
<BR>
devices left completely uninitialized by i386 firmware due to the infamous
<BR>
PnP standard.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;In short the absence of handling of PCI-PCI bridges for i386 systems is
<BR>
likely due to the lack of interest.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;  But it doesn't work well, either.  If you get dumped back to SRM due to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; an exception, the whole configuration remains messed up.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Good point. That was one of the reasons why I thought that save/restore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; code isn't very useful. However, most likely such an exception would mean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that something is screwed up anyway...
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;Of course, and you may wish to do additional diagnostics within SRM
<BR>
before you reset the system losing the ability to recover system's state
<BR>
at the time of the fault completely.  Or you may want the system to reboot
<BR>
automatically (I'm not sure it was possible to be set up, though).
