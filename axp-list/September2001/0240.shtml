<P>
Why not save your money and use it for a licence and engineers to make an
<BR>
Alpha CPU and system. That way you don't need to deal with Compaq FUD and
<BR>
aren't wasting your money with law suits that will only waste time and
<BR>
result in the Alphas demise anyway.
<BR>
<P>You aren't going to win a suit like that. Compaq still 'support' these
<BR>
systems and offer migration paths when your new Alpha hardware needs
<BR>
replacing.
<BR>
<P>Our Alphas didn't suddenly devalue because of these announcements. Last I
<BR>
checked, they were still running at the same speed, computing at a rate
<BR>
that they were when we bought them. The software we run on them didn't
<BR>
suddenly stop working.. you get the idea. People that rely on any one
<BR>
architecture to run their code are asking for trouble and those people
<BR>
that really need Alpha for running their applications because they have
<BR>
lost the source code or think the porting effort is too large, wake up, it
<BR>
is your own fault.
<BR>
<P>In the end if the DOJ or someone says to compaq, &quot;you have to keep making
<BR>
Alphas&quot;, what a fine product that will be (sarcasm).
<BR>
<P>Maybe convincing someone like Samsung to develop and manufacture Alphas
<BR>
via a partition is a better way to go.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; stuff skipped here
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; While you are at it, if you have Compaq equipment, I suggest that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; should call them up and demand they refund your money, as they devalued
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Alpha machines you bought with their poorly thought out strategy and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; announcements.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would suggest that if you recently purchased Compaq equipment that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; find other people that have recently bought Comapq equipment and start a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; class action lawsuit.  I think what Compaq did with their various FUD
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; annoucements can be considered a &quot;deceptive trade practice&quot;.  INAL (I'm not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a lawyer) but I would think that a class action suit would also get the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DOJ's attention.  The DOJ is MUCH less interested in anti-competitive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; behaviour now than it was, they have a lot on their plate at the moment.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do think that Compaq's giving away the Alpha team may violate previous court
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rulings, then again INAL.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps a spin off for Alpha can be forced?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; A lot of you made purchasing decisions based on statements by Compaq
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; regarding the &quot;future of Alpha&quot; and Compaqs commitment to it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As was the case, be it Intel or MS, DEC couldn't protect their own patents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or inventions without hireing a BIG team of lawyers.  It looks as if Compaq
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and Itel are betting that no one has the cash to take them to court.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If so, they lied to you. I suggest you demand your money back.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again, stop saying &quot;lied&quot; and start saying &quot;felony violation of the federal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; statute dot dot dot&quot;, and &quot;deceptive trade practices&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; But please, do not blame Red Hat. They had nothing to do with it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RedHat should be in on the suit, as they made some purchases WRT Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology and that technology has been pulled out of the market place
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because of a questionable merger deal?  Any people in the EU think that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; EU anti-monopoly people would have problems with some of this?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you or your company recently (within the last 12 months) purchased Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or Alpha related hardware perhaps you should e-mail the list and some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enterprising individual can collect the names.  Any state or state funded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; institutions would be especially important.  A state attorney general tends
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to take a dim view of a company defrauding it's state of even 5 dolalrs,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much less tons more.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Whose game?
