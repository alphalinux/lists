More interesting stuff from the people at theinquirer.net.  The article at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.theinquirer.net/01110105.htm">http://www.theinquirer.net/01110105.htm</A> explains how Intel has been useing
<BR>
VAX systems to run software that makes sure their own processors don't suck.
<BR>
The funniest quote is &quot;That process is now finished, but unfortunately by
<BR>
the terms of the agreement, Compaq is unable to shout out to the world that
<BR>
the Alpha chip is so good that it's even used to make Pentium 4s and
<BR>
Merceds.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Nothing earth shattering just a slightly funny read for those of us that
<BR>
enjoy irony.
<BR>
<P>As far as any legal action on recent Compaq announcements that I suggested
<BR>
recently, I did talk to a lawyer from a large law firm.  It is her opinion
<BR>
that the only legal action against Compaq would be breach of contract
<BR>
between Compaq and it's suppliers or customers.  (i.e. If you don't have a
<BR>
contract with Q then there doesn't appear to be a case for you)  This of
<BR>
course is contingent on the contract and what is in it what provisions etc..
<BR>
As far as announcements about Alpha living on and other recent press
<BR>
releases that in retrospect seem to be bald face lies? I am told that as
<BR>
long as these annoucements are made in &quot;Good faith&quot; and proving bad faith is
<BR>
extremely difficult, there is little legal action one can take there are
<BR>
exceptions but none seem to be relevant (as far as I could see). FYI
