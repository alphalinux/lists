<P>
<EM>&gt;Huh? what did RHAT buy?
</EM><BR>
<P>Working with my VERY bad &quot;slave's memory&quot; here is what I'm thinking
<BR>
<P>I believe that RHAT bought a small software development company with
<BR>
expertise in 64 bit development, specifically for the Alpha (Someone help me
<BR>
here my brain is mush)
<BR>
<P>I'd be willing to bet that not all the alpha hardware that RHAT has was
<BR>
donated.
<BR>
<P>RH partnered with Compaq on the Alpha Cluster, Enterprise toolkit and the
<BR>
Deluxe edition of the of the Alpha boxed set which included various Compaq
<BR>
tools.  Compaq's discoing has devalued those products and made Rat's
<BR>
position more difficult in regards to supporting them.  If there are any
<BR>
memorandums of understanding between RHAT and Compaq, they may need to be
<BR>
reviewed in light of recent events.  In fact I would probably guess a good
<BR>
lawyer would say ANY agreement between the 2 companies should be reviewed.
<BR>
<P>RH certificates where also excepted internally for Compaq/API training.
<BR>
(how does this affect anything, i don't know INAL)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'm just the lowly scum of the earth developer that never gets told
</EM><BR>
anything
<BR>
<EM>&gt;other than &quot;work harder/faster slave&quot; I'm interested.
</EM><BR>
<P>In management you can still be treated like a mushroom.
<BR>
<P>Daniel Potts &lt;danielp@cse.unsw.edu.au&gt; said
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Why not save your money and use it for a licence and engineers to make an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Alpha CPU and system. That way you don't need to deal with Compaq FUD and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aren't wasting your money with law suits that will only waste time and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;result in the Alphas demise anyway.
</EM><BR>
<P>Because personally I'm interested in a good alternative to the x386 entirely
<BR>
and because of my background in Physics and the analysis required when I was
<BR>
a student the alpha has always struck me as a good sound fast processor.  If
<BR>
I get a licence and some good engineers i'd probably have to contend with
<BR>
Intel lawsuits right off the bat, sad but I don't put much/any faith in a
<BR>
what a company like Compaq may be liscencing in light of their recent deeds.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Our Alphas didn't suddenly devalue because of these announcements. Last I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;checked, they were still running at the same speed, computing at a rate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that they were when we bought them. The software we run on them didn't
</EM><BR>
<P>Some software sources as recently mentioned on the list did dry up.
<BR>
Development has stopped for others.  Some hardware drivers magically stopped
<BR>
being supported from what I understand (that is rumor and hearsay, but
<BR>
fairly reliable University source)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;suddenly stop working.. you get the idea. People that rely on any one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;architecture to run their code are asking for trouble and those people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that really need Alpha for running their applications because they have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lost the source code or think the porting effort is too large, wake up, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is your own fault.
</EM><BR>
<P>I test and run all my code on Alpha before I port it to another machine.  If
<BR>
it's not 64 bit clean then it's not &quot;good code&quot;.  I've been doing that since
<BR>
I had my first alpha machine running a distro of Linux called craftworks.
<BR>
The problem is that for some really intensive calculations nothing beat an
<BR>
Alpha.  That is why some people are so fond of the architecture.
<BR>
<P>To be honest in the end, it's about holding companies accountable when they
<BR>
do something illegal.  If they get away with it, then they will try again,
<BR>
and I'm not much of a fan of letting any entity large or small break the law
<BR>
with impunity.
