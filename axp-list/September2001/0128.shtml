Hi,
<BR>
<P>I just installed the new openssh-2.9p2-8.7.apha.rpm on my xp1000 under
<BR>
rh71. But openssh doesn't work correctly for me. The command
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ssh -n machine1 &quot;command1&quot; | ssh machine2 &quot;command2&quot;
<BR>
<P>(which is part of a crontab job) used to work fine several hundred
<BR>
times a day since months under openssh-2.5.2p2 which came with rh71
<BR>
and under a hand-built ssh-1.2.31.
<BR>
<P>Now with openssh-2.9p2 that command says
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Write failed flushing stdout buffer.
<BR>
every now and then. Not always, just when it likes to. In these cases
<BR>
stdout of machine1 which is transferred to machine2 is incomplete.
<BR>
<P>I checked groups.google.com, but I couldn't find a solution to my
<BR>
problem. You can find there several problems with the scp command and
<BR>
that error message, but not with the ssh command. My shell
<BR>
initialization files (.profile etc) definitely don't write anything to
<BR>
stdout - or else it wouldn't have worked perfectly under
<BR>
openssh-2.5.2p2 and ssh-1.2.31, wouldn't it? Also, my problem is with
<BR>
the ssh command, not with the scp command.
<BR>
<P>Does anyone know, if there is a bug in that openssh-2.9p2 rpm, or did
<BR>
I configure something wrong which accidently worked up to now? Is
<BR>
there a work-around besides downgrading to openssh-2.5.2p2?
<BR>
<P>Thank for your help,
<BR>
<P><P><PRE>
