<P>
Because I have been happy with reiserfs on my Intel Linux machines, 
<BR>
I have just converted all my ext2 filesystems to reiserfs filesystems on 
<BR>
my first Alpha machine (after testing a single filesystem for a few days).  
<BR>
All appears well.  My system is SRM based, and since aboot doesn't 
<BR>
recognize reiserfs yet, I had to pull a few configuration tricks to get 
<BR>
things like I want.  All partitions except the boot partition (sda1) were 
<BR>
easily converted by copying contents to another drive, issuing a 
<BR>
mkreiserfs on the empty partition, and copying the saved contents
<BR>
back to the new partition.  The boot partition required some more work.
<BR>
I thought others might be interested so I am posting my how-to below:
<BR>
_____________________________________________________
<BR>
October 26, 2001
<BR>
<P>These are notes to myself on how to setup the boot process for
<BR>
a Debian/Alpha computer using the SRM console.  
<BR>
<P>First, create the kernel image.  This is the normal process for
<BR>
creating a kernel image.  Particular configuration options that go
<BR>
into the &quot;/usr/src/linux/.config&quot; file that are unique to this machine
<BR>
<P>CONFIG_ALPHA=y
<BR>
CONFIG_ALPHA_PC164=y
<BR>
CONFIG_ALPHA_EV5=y
<BR>
CONFIG_ALPHA_CIA=y
<BR>
CONFIG_ALPHA_SRM=y
<BR>
CONFIG_ALPHA_BROKEN_IRQ_MASK=y
<BR>
CONFIG_SRM_ENV=y
<BR>
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX=y
<BR>
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_DEFAULT_TAGS=8
<BR>
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_MAX_TAGS=32
<BR>
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_SYNC=0
<BR>
CONFIG_DE4X5=y
<BR>
CONFIG_RTC=y
<BR>
CONFIG_REISERFS_FS=y
<BR>
CONFIG_MATHEMU=y
<BR>
<P>Actually build the kernel by issuing the command
<BR>
&quot;make dep;make clean;make boot&quot;
<BR>
from the /usr/src/linux area.  You will then have the following two
<BR>
files of importance after the build (since we do not use modules for
<BR>
this machine):
<BR>
/usr/src/linux/System.map
<BR>
/usr/src/linux/arch/alpha/boot/vmlinux.gz
<BR>
<P>Second, and assuming a new v2.4.13 kernel, copy these essential files
<BR>
to four places: 
<BR>
<P>1) archival:
<BR>
cp /usr/src/linux/System.map /boot/System.map-2.4.13
<BR>
cp /usr/src/linux/arch/alpha/boot/vmlinux.gz /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.13
<BR>
ln -sf /boot/System.map-2.4.13 System.map
<BR>
ln -sf /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.13 vmlinuz
<BR>
<P>2) 1st boot option (1.44 Mb floppy drive):
<BR>
<P>Put a new floppy diskette (1.44 Mb) into the floppy drive.
<BR>
<P>Format the drive by issuing the command &quot;fdformat /dev/fd0&quot;
<BR>
<P>Create an ext2 filesystem on the floppy drive &quot;mke2fs /dev/fd0&quot;
<BR>
<P>Copy an SRM-bootable image (in aboot Debian package) by 
<BR>
&quot;e2writeboot /dev/fd0 /boot/bootlx&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Mount the floppy diskette as an ext2 filesystem
<BR>
&quot;mount /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy&quot;
<BR>
<P>Copy the kernel image to the floppy
<BR>
&quot;cp /boot/vmlinuz /mnt/floppy&quot;
<BR>
<P>umount /mnt/floppy
<BR>
<P>You can now boot the machine from this kernel stored on the floppy by
<BR>
issuing the sequence starting with &quot;shutdown -h now&quot;.  Then push the
<BR>
reset botton on the from panel.  While the machine is booting up, you
<BR>
will see SRM messages &quot;e2.e3.e4.e5.e6.e7&quot;.  At this point issue a
<BR>
couple of control-Cs (^-C).  Then it will try and boot, and issue a
<BR>
couple more control-Cs (^-C).  Note control-c is the &quot;halt&quot; key in SRM
<BR>
lingo.  This key could be reconfigured to something else, but
<BR>
control-c is fine.  You should now be at the SRM prompt that looks
<BR>
like &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; without the double quotes.  If you did not issue the
<BR>
control-Cs, the SRM firmware would automatically start booting with
<BR>
the default boot configuration which is the same as the &quot;hard drive
<BR>
direct-boot&quot; configuration below.  
<BR>
<P>Some important SRM configuration parameters that have been set for
<BR>
this machine (and given in the /proc/srm_environment) are:
<BR>
<P>bootdef_dev = dka0
<BR>
boot_file = vmlinuz
<BR>
bootos_flags = &quot;root=/dev/sdb1 cycle=500000000&quot;
<BR>
auto_action = restart
<BR>
boot_reset = on
<BR>
<P>Note: the &quot;cycle=500000000&quot; is a requirement that arose due to a
<BR>
clock-timing problem in the 2.4.x kernels on the alpha that did not
<BR>
exist in the 2.2.x kernels.  It is a workaround that will likely get
<BR>
corrected and be unnecessary in a future kernel.
<BR>
<P>Note2: The SRM console still doesn't behave exactly like I would want
<BR>
because I have to push the reset button to reboot.  I get the prompt &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;
<BR>
after a &quot;shutdown -r now&quot; or &quot;shutdown -h now&quot;, but I cannot get a
<BR>
reboot unless I hit the reset button.
<BR>
<P>To boot the floppy issue
<BR>
<P>boot dva0 -fi vmlinuz -fl &quot;root=/dev/sdb1 cycle=500000000&quot;
<BR>
<P>3) 2nd boot option (hard drive directly)
<BR>
<P>Previously, the 1st harddrive (lowest scsi ID or sda, which would get
<BR>
you the c:\ drive in the dos/windows world) has been partitioned using
<BR>
the BSD partition option of fdisk.  sda1 is 4-sector partition
<BR>
(sectors 2-5 of the sda drive) that is an ext2 filesystem type because
<BR>
aboot does not understand reiserfs, but does understand UFS, ext2,
<BR>
iso9660, etc.  sda2 starts at sector 6 and goes to the end of the
<BR>
drive and is presently a reiserfs partition.  sector 1 is left alone
<BR>
(no filesystem placed) to make room for raw binary files for aboot and
<BR>
the kernel.  The partition print from fdisk looks like this:
<BR>
<P>fdisk /dev/sda
<BR>
Detected an OSF/1 disklabel on /dev/sda, entering disklabel mode.
<BR>
To return to DOS partition table mode, use the 'r' command.
<BR>
<P>BSD disklabel command (m for help): p
<BR>
<P>2 partitions:
<BR>
#       start       end      size     fstype   [fsize bsize   cpg]
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a:        2         5         4       ext2
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;b:        6      1022      1017       ext2
<BR>
<P>BSD disklabel command (m for help):
<BR>
<P>The filesystems were made by issuing
<BR>
mke2fs /dev/sda1
<BR>
mkreiserfs /dev/sda2
<BR>
<P>The sda2 partition is used by the system as /usr3 (general user
<BR>
area).  The sda1 partition is used to store kernels, boot
<BR>
configuration, etc., and is not automounted in /etc/fstab to minimize
<BR>
the possibility of corruption (not journeled as now all the other
<BR>
partitions are with the reiserfs).
<BR>
<P>After having created the partitions and filesystems on /dev/sda, then
<BR>
we must create the direct-boot information.
<BR>
<P>A filesystem-less boot (direct-boot) is created with (from the
<BR>
/boot area):
<BR>
<P>swriteboot /dev/sda bootlx vmlinuz
<BR>
<P>The SRM system is configured by default to boot this image.  This
<BR>
default configuration is also duplicated in the aboot configuration
<BR>
(see next).
<BR>
<P>4) 3rd boot option (hard drive boot options)
<BR>
<P>Copy the new kernel image to the ext2 boot options area with the
<BR>
commands:
<BR>
<P>mount -t ext2 /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1
<BR>
cp /usr/src/linux/arch/alpha/boot/vmlinux.gz /mnt/sda1/vmlinuz-2.4.13
<BR>
<P>Also included in the same area (/mnt/sda1) are other older kernel
<BR>
images and the aboot configuration file in &quot;/mnt/sda1/etc/aboot.conf&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Confirm the correct location of the aboot configuration file by
<BR>
issuing the command
<BR>
<P>abootconf /dev/sda 1
<BR>
<P>It turns out that abootconf will only work for /dev/sda (as far as I
<BR>
can tell) which forces aboot.conf to be located where it is.  Debian
<BR>
by default puts it into /etc/aboot.conf and this would work if the
<BR>
root filesystem were sda1.  We could do this if we always booted
<BR>
from floppy or direct-boot from the hard drive.  But, if we want
<BR>
reiserfs and &quot;hard drive boot options&quot;, then we have to have the
<BR>
little ext2 filesystem in sda1.  That is basically why it is set up
<BR>
the way it is.
<BR>
<P>Now the contents of /mnt/sda1/etc/aboot.conf is
<BR>
#
<BR>
# aboot default configurations jdf 10/26/2001
<BR>
#
<BR>
# boot option descriptions:

-
<BR>
<P>With this type of arrangement, you can optionally boot from the SRM
<BR>
prompt (to get the prompt see above) by getting into the interactive
<BR>
mode of aboot:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;boot -fl i 
</EM><BR>
<P>Then issue the options directly (see the aboot help menu) when it goes
<BR>
into interactive mode)&quot;
<BR>
<P>0 (same as hard drive direct boot)
<BR>
<P>or
<BR>
<P>1 (effectively the same, but now booting from the ext2 partition)
<BR>
<P>or
<BR>
<P>2 (same as boot 1, but single-user mode)
<BR>
<P>or
<BR>
<P>etc.  (older kernels, test kernels, etc.)
<BR>
<P><P>BOTTOM LINE
<BR>
<P>cd /usr/src/linux
<BR>
make menuconfig
<BR>
make dep;make clean;make boot
<BR>
cp System.map /boot/System.map
<BR>
cp ./arch/alpha/boot/vmlinux.gz /boot/vmlinuz
<BR>
cd /boot
<BR>
swriteboot /dev/sda bootlx vmlinuz
<BR>
<P>cp other kernel images to floppy and/or hard-drive options as desired
<BR>
and described above.
