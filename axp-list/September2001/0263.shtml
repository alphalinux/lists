<P>
I think this says quite a lot. Redhat is doing this only as a
<BR>
contractual commitment to compaq, rather than a commitment to its (
<BR>
redhat's ) customer base. But so far, at least as the statement goes, is
<BR>
appears that REDHAT wont do it unless compaq signs some sort of
<BR>
agreement. No contract, no release. therefor the Inquirer is currently
<BR>
correct.
<BR>
/gat
<BR>
<P>I wonder if REDHAT requires contracts with other hardware vendors? like
<BR>
the IBM S/390 that was clearly advertised.
<BR>
<P>personally, i'd be much more happy with the 'continued support for
<BR>
Alpha' from Compaq/Digital.
