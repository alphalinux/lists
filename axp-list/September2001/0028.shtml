<P><EM>&gt; I'm using 850 GB boards, which have 4 slots.  They were integrated for

<P>The example I was giving wasn't the P4, it was the i820 or something
<BR>
like that, which only has 1 channel. The i850, if I recall correctly,
<BR>
has 2 channels, so the bus loading is quite a different issue.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; After removing half the memory, 3 of the 4 systems ran without hanging,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but one still hung up.  So I can believe that one may have some HW
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problems.  However, on the other 3, I've swapped memory in and out, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the symptoms are the same; if they have 2GB (all 4 slots filled), they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will hang, while any combination of simms in just the first 2 slots (1GB)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would let the systems run the benchmark.  Bus loading problem or bad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memory?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know, you haven't said if you attempted to swap intelligently
<BR>
to isolate particular bad chips or not. If you simply remove 1/2 of
<BR>
the chips and fewer systems hang, that could be bad chips. If all the
<BR>
systems got better, it could be bus loading, but they didn't all get
<BR>
better.
<BR>
<P>BTW, this is one reason you might want to buy a complete system
<BR>
instead of assembling out of parts. A vendor which really adds value
<BR>
will test the system, and figure out that kind of thing before you
<BR>
receive it.
