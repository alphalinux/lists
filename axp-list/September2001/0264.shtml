<P><EM>&gt; I think this says quite a lot. Redhat is doing this only as a

<EM>&gt; appears that REDHAT wont do it unless compaq signs some sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agreement. No contract, no release. therefor the Inquirer is currently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; correct.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's exactly what I was trying to say :-)  It's definitely about money
<BR>
on the &quot;backend&quot;.  I have always been a little miffed that RH had so many
<BR>
nice Alphas loaned to them and Debian didn't have even an EV6 for quite a
<BR>
while.  We have a nice machine now (UP2k...when it's running...damn
<BR>
admins), but we never were offered half of the equipment that RH got (a
<BR>
4-way ES40 AND a DS20?  must be nice to have enough modern equipment to
<BR>
say that EV6 stability is a goal).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I wonder if REDHAT requires contracts with other hardware vendors? like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the IBM S/390 that was clearly advertised.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, they do, alt least that was what I understood.  Their falling-out
<BR>
with Sun is what caused the sparc dist to die (read: Sun laughed when RH
<BR>
asked for money).
