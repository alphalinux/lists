<P>I think it only does it when you start to boot, rather than when
<BR>
you re-enter SRM from the Linux kernel. Unfortunately, the problems
<BR>
show up upon the re-entry, rather than at the boot... :-\
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Resurrecting 2.2 code wouldn't be too hard, and I thought about that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a while back, but it looked to me just as a waste of kernel memory then...
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, it shouldn't be too hard to port forward. I believe the reason it
<BR>
wasn't done as part of the 2.4 development was that a *lot* of changes
<BR>
were taking place *generically* in that area (PCI bus probing), and
<BR>
rather than confuse the issue on Alpha, the save-restore code was left
<BR>
out.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Another possible reason of those machine checks: we change PCI windows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mapping, and save/restore it for tsunami machines, but not for older
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systems. This might confuse SRM as well, isn't it?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, the window settings could certainly be a factor, if not the main
<BR>
problem...
<BR>
<P>BTW, we (COMPAQ) have done some testing on the latest boxes (ES45 and
<BR>
beyond) with NOT changing the SRM settings. It seems to work quite
<BR>
well, though the reasons may be more related to the fact that these
<BR>
later boxes have more &quot;standards-conformant&quot; hardware/console than
<BR>
the earlier ones, making it less difficult to translate the settings
<BR>
into something that Alpha Linux can use. The issue here is mainly in
<BR>
the IRQ settings and interrupt delivery rather than in DMA windows or
<BR>
resource addresses.
