<P>
<EM>&gt; With regards to your message at 11:03 AM 10/25/01, Peter Watkinson. Where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you stated:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I see www.pcnation.com has Itanium systems for sale -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;$6986
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Really? A quick search there on the word Itanium only seems to yield
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; listings for the CPUs themselves, from HP, Compaq, IBM, and so on..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Oh, there IS a listing for a Proliant system, for around $20,000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
We just bought an HP Itanium Workstation for $8K
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.hp.com/workstations/products/itanium/i2000/summary.html">http://www.hp.com/workstations/products/itanium/i2000/summary.html</A>
<BR>
that I'm planning to run Linux on.  It is for development / porting not
<BR>
production at this point so the raw performance is not as big a concern.  We
<BR>
are moving from Alpha to Linux.  We have been disappointed with our Compaq
<BR>
XP1000 to say the least and had the unfortunate experience of picking DCG as
<BR>
our alternate vendor who has since gone out of business.  We are getting
<BR>
some support from Atipa which has been helpful but it is certainly not the
<BR>
level of support we paid DCG for.  Of the mainline vendors (HP, IBM, Compaq,
<BR>
SGI) that I checked, the HP was the most reasonable workstation
<BR>
configuration.
<BR>
<P>The Itanium production &quot;chip&quot; (McKinley) is slated to be out 1Q 2002.  Given
<BR>
the track record of Intel with the Itanium, that may be iffy.  Also, does
<BR>
anyone have an answer to the original question:
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Has anyone seen the price for RH7.1 for Itanium systems - $499 has anyone
</EM><BR>
any idea why it is so expensive?
<BR>
<P>Putting a Linux release for a different CPU on CD should not cost $500 and I
<BR>
didn't really see anything in the offering over the Alpha or Intel versions
<BR>
that would justify the price.  Any insight?
<BR>
<P>Frank
