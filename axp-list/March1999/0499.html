&quot;Dr . David Alan Gilbert&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:dg@px.uk.com?subject=Re:%20Prices%20for%20AlphaLinux%20systems%20with%204-8GB%20RAM%20?">dg@px.uk.com</A>&gt; replied to me:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;	These issues have been mentioned before (like up to 2 years ago),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;	but as far as I understand, nobody has made necessary tweaks to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;	PCI bus device drivers to do sort of 'bounce buffers' scheme we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;	already use for the ISA-bus devices.  (GFP_DMA, and the new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;	GFP_DMA_PCI32 ?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What happens on 64 bit PCI slots? Would it be possible to build a system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with a LOT of RAM which only used 64 bit PCI devices (I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you can get SCSI, I think network as well ???)
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alpha systems I have seen do have 32-bit address busses in
<BR>
their IO busses, however they often have mapping window machinery
<BR>
to be able to map a few (4, 16 or perhaps even 32) address windows
<BR>
to the global main memory bus, and the device drivers would need
<BR>
to update those mapping windows every so often...  In low-endish
<BR>
systems the CPU/MEMORY/PCI bridge chipset (the 21*7* chips) does
<BR>
DMA window mappings in between the PCI bus and the main memory,
<BR>
and due to the way how those chipsets work, we can go only up to
<BR>
1 or 2 GB (depending the chipset) of memory which is directly
<BR>
reachable from the PCI bus.
<BR>
<P>So far I have not seen reports that PCI64 devices would use 64-bit
<BR>
ADDRESSes. Apparently it is possible, but we don't have any drivers
<BR>
using them yet.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, we already have drivers which operate DMA in
<BR>
ISA-bus constrained 16 MB space, modifying PCI drivers to cope
<BR>
with 1-2 GB DMA address space limit in similar manner isn't
<BR>
impossible, and in fact the &quot;&gt;4G&quot; RAM folks for intel platforms
<BR>
will need them too.
<BR>
<P>In your 2.2.* source tree, execute following to see which size is
<BR>
supported (per default) by which core-logic:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grep _DMA_WIN_SIZE_DEFAULT include/asm-*/core*.h
<BR>
<P>Right now I don't have time to tinker with this issue, but I can
<BR>
hopefully review the work somebody else does, and direct people
<BR>
to feasible directions in case they err to suboptimal path.
<BR>
<P>Any volunteers ?
