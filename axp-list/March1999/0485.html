Greetings,
<BR>
<P>I'm only furthering this thread with a response because I am aware of the
<BR>
number of Compaq (formerly Digital) employees who monitor this list, and I
<BR>
somewhat expect that certain comments posted here might find their way
<BR>
further into the company.
<BR>
<P>On that note, I would like to voice my opinion, as an engineer and as a
<BR>
long-time Linux enthusiast, on the developing relationship between Compaq
<BR>
Corporation and the greater Linux community.
<BR>
<P>Compaq has shown more public support for Linux than I ever would have
<BR>
imagined.  Their efforts to recognize the Linux community have turned my
<BR>
opinion of them 180 degrees from contempt to respect (as will be reflected
<BR>
in my purchasing power).
<BR>
<P>I agree that in their zeal for waving the Linux flag, they have perhaps
<BR>
overstated their (historical) contributions, to some degree.  However,
<BR>
although it may be appropriate to push for factual representation of
<BR>
events, I would strongly argue that we take care to not jeopardize their
<BR>
enthusiasm.  An amicable relationship between Compaq and the Linux comm. is
<BR>
in both parties' greater interest.  The best thing for Linux/Alpha right
<BR>
now is for Compaq to feel positive about continuing to publicly contribute
<BR>
inside knowledge to Linux.
<BR>
<P>-bp
<BR>
<PRE>
