<P>
<EM>&gt; We've seen this kind of effect repeatedly on our various Alpha/Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boxes.  Often, as was pointed out, it has no real negative effects.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But we've definitely had cases where we couldn't start up certain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; applications any more, or could not even telnet into the system any more.
</EM><BR>
<P>I could imagine that this could be due to a lack of zeroed pages. But
<BR>
your fix is pretty drastic for a problem that I've never seen. So this
<BR>
bug has to be fairly obscure.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Often, it seems that network-related processes contribute to this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; behavior, especially if there's a problem with the network, or some faulty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; network setup etc.  We've had cases where a 512 MB machine came up with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4 kB free memory after RPC'ing like crazy during boot-up.
</EM><BR>
<P>So? That doesn't mean anything. The only symptom you've described
<BR>
that's alarming is that you can't start some processes. Having low
<BR>
&quot;free&quot; memory is a feature of Linux disk buffering, not a bug.
