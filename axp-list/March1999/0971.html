<P>
I've been reading the posts regarding HD performace (hdparm -t/-T)
<BR>
and I have had a nagging question on the back burning, which is
<BR>
why isn't my SCSI BUS' performance up to snuff?
<BR>
<P>I wrote some performance analysis software to examine SCSI
<BR>
performance, to manipulate the SCSI HD cache and to program
<BR>
some of the mode page info (local HD characteristic info).
<BR>
I'm using the scsi-generic interface rather than the
<BR>
sd device.
<BR>
<P>With the the SCSI drives I'm testing with an Adaptec Ultra-Wide
<BR>
(not 2) controller I get the following
<BR>
<P>sequential reads:
<BR>
<P>no cache read ahead :  2.9MBs
<BR>
cache read ahead    : 12.5MBs (same as comes out of hdparm)
<BR>
<P>I also did a test just reading from the drives preloaded cache:
<BR>
<P>preloaded cache only: 22.0MBs
<BR>
<P>So what happened to the 40MBs synchronous transfers of my 
<BR>
ultra wide SCSI BUS?
<BR>
<P>And what would happen if I put in an U2W controller?
<BR>
<P>The drives are identified as sync 40MBs.
<BR>
<P>I have to admit that SCSI generic (without futzing with the kernel)
<BR>
only allows 32KB reads (kindof).  However, experimintation with the
<BR>
block size did not affect performance adversly enough to account
<BR>
for 18 MBs of lost transfer efficiency.
<BR>
<P>The drives are actually U2W so I can't imagine they are running out
<BR>
of steam on cache only transfers at 22MBs, but will recheck their
<BR>
specs just in case.
<BR>
