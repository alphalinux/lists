<EM>&gt; In all seriousness, though, I hope the Debian Alpha install procedure (at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; least for a network install) has been debugged a little bit since I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; last tried Debian Alpha late last year.  I had difficulty getting it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to actually let me pick what was installed (it'd go on no matter what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I did and try to FTP *everything*, and yes I did RTFM! :) ) It's the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reason I bought a Redhat CD in the first place, after all.

<P>There are new releases of the boot/install floppies that Loic Prylli just
<BR>
finished this week.  FYI, I've been working on the Alpha port of Debian
<BR>
for well over a year now and, believe me, install is *MUCH* easier than it
<BR>
was before (we had to untar the base tarball onto the hard drive back
<BR>
then, then move the drive over to the Alpha).  I just ran an install onto
<BR>
my Noname about two weeks ago and everything went really smoothly.
<BR>
<P>&lt;BLATANT PLUG&gt;If you have a spare disk, give it a try.  Alot of work has
<BR>
been put into it and you may find that some of those &quot;problematic&quot;
<BR>
packages that RH has are fixed in Debian&lt;/BLATANT PLUG&gt;.
<BR>
<P>Also, fyi, I'm running the preliminary glibc 2.1 debs on my UDB (still
<BR>
2.0.7 on my Noname, though) and things are working VERY nicely so far...
