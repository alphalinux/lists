</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I (the original poster) don't know if a scatter-gather solution is required
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (it is supported by alpha hardware, I don't know about others).  It may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible to do it without scatter-gather support in hardware.
</EM><BR>
<P>On Alpha, a scatter-gather solution is the *only* way to allow all devices
<BR>
direct access to all of memory. Without it, one is forced to employ bounce
<BR>
buffers.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; On alpha scatter-gather is simply an address translation scheme that allows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; small granularity (8kb).  I don't know how much kernel support beyond
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bus_alloc/virt_to_bus/bus_dealloc would be required to implement bounce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; buffers using the scatter-gather mappings.  Perhaps someone who understands
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bounce buffers would care to comment?  (I'm still not sure what they are... )
</EM><BR>
<P>Bounce buffers are buffers in memory at locations that can be accessed
<BR>
directly by devices, in a system which has additional memory which CANNOT be
<BR>
directly accessed by those devices because of their addressing limitations.
<BR>
This has been most commonly encountered with &quot;true&quot; ISA devices, which have
<BR>
a memory address limitation of 16Mb (24 bits). In a machine which has more
<BR>
than 16Mb of memory, a device driver could allocate a buffer in the low 16Mb
<BR>
of the address space, do the device DMA to that buffer, and then copy the
<BR>
data out of that buffer to a memory location above 16Mb, hence the name
<BR>
&quot;bounce buffer&quot;.
<BR>
<P>And one would not use SG mapping to implement bounce buffers; SG mapping
<BR>
eliminates the need for bounce buffers.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I wonder if it would be possible to take a poll of hardware owners to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; determine which chipsets support scatter-gather.  I don't know if this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; part of the PCI spec, or a hack implemented by Digital and Sun.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is NOT part of the PCI spec; it is a platform specific feature, implemented
<BR>
(differently) on the ALPHA and SPARC, and probably others.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Will Merced chipsets support scatter-gather?
</EM><BR>
<P>No idea, but this would prolly be covered by an NDA at this time, anyway... ;-}
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; At any rate, a generic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bus_alloc/bus_dealloc should be able to hide whatever memory-&gt;bus remapping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the hardware supports...whether scatter-gather exists on all chipsets or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not.
</EM><BR>
<P>If correctly designed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Most importantly: if bounce buffers are required to access memory &gt;1GB from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; PCI, can it be done with a simple bus_alloc/virt_to_bus/bus_dealloc?  Or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; must we implement a more complex solution that can handle both cases?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, let examine it...
<BR>
<P>Case 1: bus_alloc where direct access is possible without SG mapping, is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simply the equivalent of virt_to_bus now. bus_dealloc is a no-op.
<BR>
<P>Case 2: bus_alloc where SG mapping must be used to directly access memory,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns the bus address (in the SG map) for the desired destination.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bus_dealloc will release the SG mapping resources used.
<BR>
<P>Case 3: bus_alloc where bounce buffers are required, simply returns the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bus address of an allocated bounce buffer. bus_dealloc would copy
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the bounce buffer to the desired destination, and free the bounce
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;buffer.
<BR>
<P>A bit overly simplistic, but did I miss/overlook anything? Does this seem
<BR>
reasonable?
