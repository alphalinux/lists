<P><EM>A&gt; Intel showed a 1000 MHz chip, and it's so flustrating to see the superior
</EM><BR>
<EM>A&gt; alpha fall/lag behind.  How long has the alpha been at 500 MHz and with
</EM><BR>
<EM>A&gt; chips that were produced with the .35 micron process???? (imagine them at
</EM><BR>
<EM>A&gt; .18?)
</EM><BR>
<P>There's a big difference between a prototype and a product.
<BR>
Or looking at it a different way, there's a differnece between a processor
<BR>
and a system.
<BR>
<P><EM>A&gt; I sure do hope the IBM fabs get geared up soon.  I'd really like to kick
</EM><BR>
<EM>A&gt; some Intel butt.  It was pretty fun back in &quot;the day&quot; to go faster when
</EM><BR>
<EM>A&gt; the P75 was the hot intel offering, now with the PIII 500 MHz whats an
</EM><BR>
<EM>A&gt; alpha lover to do??
</EM><BR>
<P>Use FP a lot. Int has never been Alpha's particular speciality.
<BR>
And Bang per buck always has had Intel on the throne.
<BR>
<P>Phil
<BR>
<P>These stories from The Register.
<BR>
<P>----------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>High-end Alpha spreads like Wildfire
<BR>
<P>Further confirmation that Compaq is pushing ahead using Alpha as a
<BR>
high end system is likely to provoke fear and loathing at Intel.
<BR>
<P>According to our mole deep down in Compaq's skunkworks, the company is
<BR>
set to demonstrate Win64 running on Alpha in the very near future.
<BR>
<P>Further, Compaq has successfully booted a Wildfire system, the same
<BR>
source said. Wildfire is likely to be announced before Christmas in a
<BR>
16 CPU version, with a 32-way system available next year. The CPU will
<BR>
be the EV67.
<BR>
<P>And Compaq is also benchmarking 667MHz EV6 TurboLasers, with initial
<BR>
benchmarks showing blazing speeds.
<BR>
<P>Intel marketeers in Santa Clara are now likely to be anxiously
<BR>
scratching their heads and wondering about Compaq's dual 64-bit
<BR>
strategy. =AE
<BR>
<P>----------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>Alpha chip to clock 1.4GHz in copper
<BR>
<P>Details of the Alpha roadmap leaked to The Register show how serious
<BR>
the consortium is in its attempt to give Intel a run for its money.
<BR>
<P>Samsung and API will move to a .13 micron process in 2001, while the
<BR>
EV68 platform, using aluminium interconnects, will achieve a one
<BR>
gigahertz clock rate by the end of this year.
<BR>
<P>That will be followed by a copper version of the EV68 platform which
<BR>
will have a clock speed of 1100MHz, also by the end of this year.
<BR>
<P>Towards the end of next year, the consortium will introduce the EV7
<BR>
copper platform, with clock speeds of 1100MHz, while the EV8 copper
<BR>
platform is likely to arrive in 2001 with clock frequencies of
<BR>
1400MHz.
<BR>
<P>API itself will make 1-2, 1-4, and 1-8 way Alpha boards. The 264DP and
<BR>
164LX/UX platforms will be replaced later this year with Slot B (K7
<BR>
and Alpha compatible) boards, as revealed here earlier.
<BR>
<P>There will be a new uniprocessor board based on the AMD-developed
<BR>
Irongate support chip instead of the current DEC Pyxis [and Tsunami - awg]
<BR>
chipset.
<BR>
<P>Our source scoffed at Intel senior VP's suggestion that the Alpha
<BR>
could not succeed because Compaq could not afford the fab
<BR>
investment. That problem, he said, is solved by the Alpha
<BR>
consortium. =AE
