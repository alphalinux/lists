<EM>&gt;Intel showed a 1000 MHz chip, and it's so flustrating to see the superior
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;alpha fall/lag behind.  How long has the alpha been at 500 MHz and with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;chips that were produced with the .35 micron process???? (imagine them at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;.18?)
</EM><BR>
<P>No offense young Jedi, but I may have to use some of the logic you are
<BR>
promoting as an organic fertilizer supplement this summer.  
<BR>
There are numerous flaws in your statement, but I'll pick out the most obvious
<BR>
(anyone who's had a systems architecture course probably will want to stop
<BR>
&nbsp;reading here :-)
<BR>
<P>1. Faster clock rate is not always better
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounding the death dirge for the Alpha architecture because Intel 
<BR>
finally matches the clock rate DEC had achieved two (?) years ago with an x86 
<BR>
is foolish at best.
<BR>
Architectures are not all created equal.  Recall the 50Mhz Motorola 68040
<BR>
provided as an upgrade to the stock Amiga 4000, which at 50MHz had overall 
<BR>
performance equal to the Pentium at 100MHz or 120MHz.  Same could be said
<BR>
about the SuperSPARC line.    
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the coin, remember the Exponential (XP) processor
<BR>
which promised to clean house in the consumer computer market? Their 
<BR>
design at 500Mhz was architecturally inferiour to the current x86 on the 
<BR>
market at the time on every operation (as I recall).  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoting clock speed is more a tool of the marketing department 
<BR>
than the engineering dept.  As far as architectural simplicity and beauty, 
<BR>
the Alpha has got x86 beat by a long shot. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
2. Systems are complex, one variable does not determine overall performance
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit of SGI philosophy I have adopted when evaluating a
<BR>
system I've never touched before.  You see, SGI recognized a long time back
<BR>
that processor speed is not the limiting bottleneck for most applications.
<BR>
This also is mentioned in Eric Raymond's now-outdated Linux hardware guide.
<BR>
By speeding up things like the graphics subsystem, disk subsystem, 
<BR>
memory bus, etc. you are able to enhance overall usability and performance
<BR>
by a wide margin.   
<BR>
<P>3. An overclocked x86 with nitrogen cooling is still an x86
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intel has this nasty little habit of darn little variety and 
<BR>
virtually no innovation to speak of.  Oh, they add 'multimedia' instructions 
<BR>
once in a blue moon but those are mostly of no consequence to Un*x users 
<BR>
(well, mpg123 can use the MMX/3Dnow! insn set).  Intel relies on the 
<BR>
gullibility of the general populus to purchase their processors solely
<BR>
on the image presented on the tele.  Their marketing team and 
<BR>
Hired Chimpanzees In Spacesuits (HCIS at Intel Corp.) are extremely
<BR>
effective at selling the unsuspecting person a processor which 
<BR>
performs no more than 5% better than the last generation chip, 
<BR>
but retails at 300% the price of the prior product.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I sure do hope the IBM fabs get geared up soon.  I'd really like to kick
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some Intel butt.  It was pretty fun back in &quot;the day&quot; to go faster when
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who says we aren't kicking Intel butt right now? Check out some
<BR>
of the links under &quot;Hardware&quot; at &lt;<A HREF="http://www.alphalinux.org/">http://www.alphalinux.org/</A>&gt;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;the P75 was the hot intel offering, now with the PIII 500 MHz whats an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;alpha lover to do??
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not get sucked in by Intel marketing droids and stop acting 
<BR>
paranoid?
<BR>
<P>Best regards,
<BR>
Daniel
