<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It seems I'm getting close to get my stuff working on my SX.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But in fact this task requires much more RAM which I need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I can afford for my own machine. This task is for project
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and that project has some budget :-) I contacted local
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supercomputer facilities but their requirement to sign
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a contract for 4 years minimum (with price about several $K
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; each) doesn't seem terrible attractive to me. So, I'd be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happy to promote AlphaLinux machine if I'd be able to find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good prices. There is NO modern Unix machines at all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in my University which can help so I'll definetely need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to buy something and the only competitor I see so far
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a Pentium Linux :-) I'm writing this message from a PII350,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which isn't too bad but we have hard time trying to get its RAM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at least above 512MB  (prices for 256MB modules I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; got from European suppliers are about $1K each).

<P>Pentium class is out of the question.  32 bit address space limits you to
<BR>
4GB.  In practice, because of how the memory is segmented, you can only put
<BR>
1GB on any Intel system.  There are patches to hack it up to 2GB, but at the
<BR>
expense of larger per-process memory usage (IIRC).  Apparently the Xeon
<BR>
class processors support 36-bit addressing, but in a stupid and archaic
<BR>
(typical Intel) method of segmentation/bank switching.  There was discussion
<BR>
yesterday on the kernel list about adding support for this to the kernel,
<BR>
and the response was generally negative.  You never know though, someone
<BR>
might write it...
<BR>
<P>I'm interested to hear a response on the question of using only 64-bit PCI
<BR>
slots on alpha...  PCI is another Intel design.  People over there have
<BR>
their brains hardwired to 32-bit...
<BR>
<P>Also take a look at UltraPenguin Linux on Sparc 64's.  I don't know if they
<BR>
support more memory, but it's worth a look since it's theoretically
<BR>
possible.
