<EM>&gt; If you look at both of these 'free' outputs, you will notice that a good 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; amount of memory is tied up in both cached and shared memory allocation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My system shows approx. 11M of physical memory free.  However, if I were to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; launch Netscape 4.51 (memory footprint of what, 30M?) I could do so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without dipping into swap space.  
</EM><BR>
<P>what you say is true, but i was more concerned with the -/+ buffers/cache
<BR>
line of the free(1) output.  that line, if i understand it correctly,
<BR>
indicates what your are using and have available if you dont count buffers
<BR>
and cache.  in your example, it shows that you have about 40M used and
<BR>
about 87M free.  *those* are the numbers that i'm wondering about.  on my
<BR>
machine, the -/+ buffers/cache used climbs to ~110M during the activity of
<BR>
the day, then drops down to ~25M during the night.
<BR>
<P>when i compare the 110M to the output of &quot;ps axm&quot; during a quiet time in
<BR>
the day (i.e., no user jobs running), i see that the the total memory used
<BR>
doesn't seem to add up to the 110M that free(1) indicates.  and yes, X has
<BR>
the biggest memory footprint on an idle machine...
<BR>
<P>at first i thought there was a memory leak somewhere, but when it went
<BR>
back down to something reasonable over night, i figure that i must not be
<BR>
understanding something.
<BR>
<P>any other ideas?
