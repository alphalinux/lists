<P>
Thanks for all the advice I've received so far!
<BR>
<P>First about my 2940U2W question:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;My MILO is an LX164 MILO (2.0.30) from RH 5.0 and 
<BR>
&nbsp;is currently burnt into the flash rom on board.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;I would very much like to upgrade it at least to 
<BR>
&nbsp;a 2.0.35 based MILO, because those would recognize 
<BR>
&nbsp;Adaptec 2940U2W (which seems to be the only realistic 
<BR>
&nbsp;LVD-alternative to me so far; I need to connect 
<BR>
&nbsp;FAST-2 SCSI as well as LVD/SE drives without losing 
<BR>
&nbsp;the Ultra2 and I can't afford any of the dual channel 
<BR>
&nbsp;LVD cards by Symbios or Intraserver). 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;I also need to burn the new MILO into the flash rom, 
<BR>
&nbsp;because neither AlphaBIOS 5.66 nor SRM do recognize 
<BR>
&nbsp;the 2940U2W. I tried putting fmu.gz and 2.0.35 MILO on
<BR>
&nbsp;a same floppy and running fmu.gz, but apparently the
<BR>
&nbsp;fmu.gz contains a MILO binary, since the new flash
<BR>
&nbsp;gave me the old 2.0.30 MILO. The problem is that I 
<BR>
&nbsp;could't find 2.0.35+ version of the fmu.gz anywhere. 
<BR>
&nbsp;Can I create the fmu.gz somehow by myself from a 
<BR>
&nbsp;2.0.35 MILO?
<BR>
<P>Then about the kernel boot problem:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;My current MILO (the one in the flash rom) does 
<BR>
&nbsp;recognize my current SCSI-card and I haven't had
<BR>
&nbsp;any problems with it so far. The question still
<BR>
&nbsp;remains, why does the 2.2.3 kernel, booting from
<BR>
&nbsp;LX164 MILO, think it is running on an EB164, not 
<BR>
&nbsp;on a LX164 based AlphaPC?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;With the &quot;Generic&quot; kernel I meant that in config
<BR>
&nbsp;phase I set my Alpha type as &quot;Generic&quot;, instead
<BR>
&nbsp;of LX164 or PC164. I have tried booting with an
<BR>
&nbsp;EB164 kernel, which didn't work (!?). I still
<BR>
&nbsp;need to try a PC164 option.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;I've also been wondering whether the 2.0.30 MILO 
<BR>
&nbsp;could be too old for a 2.2.3 kernel?
<BR>
