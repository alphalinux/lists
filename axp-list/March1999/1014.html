<P>Here, Here, I whole heatedly agree......I consider myself fairly
<BR>
competent on Linux and other flavors of *nix, but I was not always
<BR>
that way. We all gotta start somewhere, and lets be honest, sometime
<BR>
the man pages are not the most informative things around.
<BR>
<P>And as for this comment:
<BR>
<P>&quot;&gt; If you cannot figure out how to setup a bloody ftp server then you
<BR>
<EM>&gt;probably shouldn't be running Linux.....&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>on the previous message, all I gotta say is that I didn't know you
<BR>
were born with all your knowledge of computers and a keyboard in your
<BR>
hands.....or is that in you're a**.......
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I guess my point is that I still ask what some would consider
<BR>
&quot;newbie&quot; questions....so what.....we all gotta learn. If we are not
<BR>
willing to help a new person, can't say there is much hope for the OS
<BR>
itself.....
<BR>
<P>Just my .02
<BR>
<P>William
<BR>
<P>PS -&gt; I know.....I sent this with Microsoft Outlook, so keep the
<BR>
hypocrite comments to yourself...I use MS at work.

<BR>
<P>i am running this on a alpha machine infact its a 200 4/233 machine. 
<BR>
If i
<BR>
dont ask questions to people that know the answere how am i supposed
<BR>
to
<BR>
learn.  this is a mailing list for questions about redhat linux on
<BR>
alpha
<BR>
which i am running.  no one has specified that this is or is not for
<BR>
newbie
<BR>
questions.  till the owner of this mailing list ask me to stop sending
<BR>
these
<BR>
questions i will continue to send them.  if you had a question for one
<BR>
of
<BR>
the people on this mailing list and told you to stop sending them in
<BR>
because
<BR>
they thought you were some kind of novice wouldnt you feel like shit. 
<BR>
well
<BR>
you should make people feel like shit because you know more than them.
<BR>
always remember there is always someone out there that is alot smarter
<BR>
than
<BR>
you.  So do not knock down people that dont know as much as you but
<BR>
are
<BR>
willing to learn.  Linux is a learning opportunity that i took and if
<BR>
you
<BR>
dont want to help you dont have too.  If you dont like helping out
<BR>
others
<BR>
then you shouldnt be on this mailing list.  But to those that have
<BR>
been
<BR>
helpful thank you.   just dont be a jerk.

<EM>&gt;&gt; I have some instructions on setting up a server.  Im trying to
</EM><BR>
follow
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; the instructions but they are not in that great of detail so i am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; kinda lost.  the instructions are as follows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; create the dev dir (/usr/ftp/dev) and user the mknod command to
</EM><BR>
copy
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; the /dev/zero file.  you need to retain the same major and minor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; device numbers as the /dev/zero file in /dev.  Thi device file is
</EM><BR>
used
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; also by ld.so (hence ls). Do this step only if ls requires the /lib
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; directory files mentioned earlier.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; i still dont get how to use mknod to copy the files?  and as for
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; major and minor i dont understand.  I tried reading the manual
</EM><BR>
pages
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; but that was no help.  thank you
