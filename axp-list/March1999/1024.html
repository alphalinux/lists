More on this particulr problem later.  But first a tirade.  
<BR>
<P>I withdraw the question.  I can see from the Ken Dawg's response to other
<BR>
questions that this is not the place to bother the &quot;all knowing ones&quot; with
<BR>
trivialities.  It's a shame.  I have an electric car based largely on the
<BR>
helpfulness I found on the EV mailing list.  I wonder if the NT communitee
<BR>
is any friendlier.  No wonder software companies are more inclined to
<BR>
support windows.  :-\
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok that's enough sarcasm.  I know that Mr. Dawg doesn't represent the
<BR>
linux communitee.  I even know where he's coming from.  As someone who's
<BR>
first home computer has 16k of ram, and who remember's the horror of seeing
<BR>
your program stored on a stack of punch cards that just tipped over and
<BR>
scattered, I've always known at least a bit more about computers than the
<BR>
people around me.  Those newbie questions can wear a little thin.  HOWEVER,
<BR>
you're not going to get anywhere in life if you're not willing to help
<BR>
other people out.  That's especially true when you find yourself on the
<BR>
fringes.  If you don't help the newbies onto your OS, then they'll just go
<BR>
elsewhere.  Then the software developers will figure it's not worth
<BR>
supporting your platform.  I watched something like that  happen to OS/2.
<BR>
The folks at IBM decided not to support the home market. Too much work.
<BR>
Too many supid questions.  For some reason it never occured to them that
<BR>
business execs are probably going to want to have the same stuff at work
<BR>
that they have at home.  How many people do you know w/ OS/2 now? (Besides me)
<BR>
<P>........................................................................
<BR>
<P>Enough waste of bandwidth.  As for the above problem:  It's solved... sort
<BR>
of.  I popped the case, and the video card is not an E1 as stated in the
<BR>
manifest, but an E2.  A quick look at supported hardware list at redhat
<BR>
told me that E1 is the only flavour that's supported.  The folks probably
<BR>
ran out of E1's and figured they were doing someone a favor by dropping
<BR>
inthe next higher model.
<BR>
<P>So at the risk of offending Mr. Dawg (or perhaps with the intent of
<BR>
offending him) I'll ask another silly question.  Does anyone know of a fix
<BR>
that allows support for the E2?  If so, how stable is it? Failing that, I
<BR>
guess I'll have to accept that I'm not done spending money yet.
