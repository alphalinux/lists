<P><EM>&gt; No, No, No.... this looks like the older TurboChanel machines. This will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; NOT run Linux, and it (or ones just like it) have been on Ebay for months.
</EM><BR>
<P>You could still buy it for $51 and swipe the memory and stuff out of it.
<BR>
That alone is worth it's current price. You could then plop that stuff
<BR>
in a BB multia and be on your way.
<BR>
<P>BTW I suspected it was a turbo channel machine but wasn't certain.
