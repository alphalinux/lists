<P><P>SYRACUSE, New York (AP) -- A Pennsylvania man's lawsuit naming God as a
<BR>
defendant has been thrown out by a court in Syracuse. 
<BR>
<P>Donald Drusky, 63, of East McKeesport, Pennsylvania, blames God for
<BR>
failing to bring him justice in a 30-year battle against his former
<BR>
employer, the steelmaker now called USX Corp. 
<BR>
<P>The company fired him in 1968, when it was called U.S. Steel. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;Defendant God is the sovereign ruler of the universe and took no
<BR>
corrective action against the leaders of his Church and his Nation for
<BR>
their extremely serious wrongs, which ruined the life of Donald S.
<BR>
Drusky,&quot; the lawsuit said. 
<BR>
<P>Drusky wanted God to return his youth and grant him the guitar-playing
<BR>
skills of famous guitarists, along with resurrecting his mother and his
<BR>
pet pigeon. If God failed to appear in court, federal rules of civil
<BR>
procedure say he must lose by default, Drusky argued. 
<BR>
<P>U.S. District Judge Norman Mordue last week found the suit -- which also
<BR>
named former presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, the television
<BR>
networks, all 50 states, every single American, all federal judges, and
<BR>
the 100th through 105th congresses as defendants -- to be frivolous.
