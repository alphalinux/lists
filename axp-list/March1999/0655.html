<P>
About 10 minutes after sending the message below it locked up again.
<BR>
<P>names: noname = the AXPpci33 server that locks up. mustang = the local
<BR>
system I use as a workstation.
<BR>
<P>1. This time there where no print jobs, so you can cut that off.
<BR>
2. I had two (2) telnet connections to &quot;noname&quot; from &quot;mustang&quot;.
<BR>
2.a. one of them was telnet'ed again to my ISP but otherwise idle.
<BR>
2.b. in the other telnet session I decided I wanted to try and run mozilla
<BR>
remotly (on noname) and typed '/usr/local/mozilla/mozila&amp;', it then about
<BR>
10 seconds later locked up.
<BR>
3. I had a local mozilla running (on &quot;mustang&quot;) going through &quot;noname&quot;
<BR>
(who provides masquerading) to the Internet.
<BR>
<P><P>The way I see it this only leaves:
<BR>
1. a ethernet problem?
<BR>
2. a telnet problem?
<BR>
3. some other network related problem?
<BR>
4. a X Window + network problem?
<BR>
<P>Does anyone have an idea, even a far fetched one?? More then one lockup a
<BR>
month is too much, let along two on one day...
<BR>
<P><P><P>TIA,
<BR>

Subject: Strage lockup yet again...
<BR>
<P><P>This is starting to get annoying... This time the dialup link was active,
<BR>
I was telnet'en through the machine to my ISP and printing postscript file
<BR>
via ghostscript 5.50.
<BR>
<P>Again, the only errors in the syslog are from ghostscript (normal 
<BR>
unaligned traps)...
<BR>
<P>The entire system locks up, you can't get mouse or keyboard response out
<BR>
of it, and it doesn't respond to pings.
<BR>
<P>It doesn't seem to be hardware related (heat at lest) as I can power it
<BR>
off and then back on again with no problem.
<BR>
<P>The system:
<BR>
Noname (AXPpci33), 32MB RAM, 2GB SCSI-2 HDD, 32x SCSI-2 CD-ROM.
<BR>
RH 5.2 (upgraded from 5.1) my own 2.0.35 kernel (source from gatekeeper).
<BR>
<P><P>Any help would be VERY MUCH appreciated!
<BR>
<P><P>TIA,
<BR>
