<EM>&gt; &gt; OK. I have Linux mostly installed on the XP1000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that arrived today. I'm running into a couple problems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 1. The main board has a 21142 built in that tulip
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    seems unable to run properly. In particular, tulip
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    wants to believe that my 100Mb hub is 10Mb. Also,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Are you using a &quot;REAL&quot; cat 5 cable?  Or a home made?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Real cables. I only rarely build my own when I need a
<BR>
custom length for racks.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;    since this is a kernel from gatekeeper, it appears
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    tulip is built in, not a module since lsmod doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    show anything. So, I'm off downloading the latest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    2.2.3 kernel to see if I can get this puppy to behave.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    Has anyone gotten 21142's to behave and was it tulip
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    or de4x5? Also what version of the driver and any parms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd try both as modules.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's the current plan but since two folks say to go to
<BR>
the latest tulip instead of the one that comes in 2.2.3,
<BR>
I'll try that one instead of the current one.
<BR>
<P>This is the most critical issue since all my stuff is
<BR>
NFS'd to all systems for access.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    to set. If I can't find a working version, I will see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    about disabling the onboard 21142 and installing a 21140
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    based adapter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thats a worst case.
</EM><BR>
<P>True. That's why I'm not a big fan of built in HW on a
<BR>
motherboard for video/SCSI/networking. It requires you
<BR>
to chase drivers vs put in a board you know works. I have 
<BR>
the 2.2.3 src and will build a kernel. I'll try the XP1000
<BR>
first but I'm not hopeful that will build any better than
<BR>
egcs 1.1.2 has. One comment though. After building egcs 1.1.2
<BR>
on my 164LX, I ran one of my benchmarks. It seems for reasonably
<BR>
well laid out loops that use mult/add FP, you can get substantial
<BR>
performance improvement. (from 310 MFLOPS to 456 MFLOPS) Quite
<BR>
an improvement in the scheduling algorithm for 21164's...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 2. I seem to have either heat problems or the memory dimms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    are not up to standard. I can't get the latest egcs1.1.2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Are you using this stock memory?  Did you add your own?  What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exactly did you add?  What happens if it's stock only?  Any ecc
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memory errors in syslog?
</EM><BR>
<P>It's the memory that came in the box so I assume it
<BR>
should work. I plan on bringing a stick over to the
<BR>
local dealer today and see exactly what it is and if
<BR>
they have any. They have a tester to see what it is.
<BR>
<P>I also created and left running a memory hog test that
<BR>
repeatedly accessed 100MB of memory on a 128MB system 
<BR>
which ran 8 hours without a miscompare so I'm leaning
<BR>
away from it being a memory issue. I'm running it now
<BR>
so that it forces the system to page. We'll see how that
<BR>
goes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    to go thru a full build. It builds fine on my 164LX. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    get either core dumps at what appear to be random places
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    or I get a message something like &quot;Unable to dup fd xxxxxxxx
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    to fd 0&quot; while trying to copy the files to the installed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    location. The first location looks obviously bogus.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    Anyone seen that before??
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 3. I added a Symbios 875J based UW SCSI to the system and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are a limited number of controllers supported in the bios,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some ncr, qlogic, and adaptec.  I suspect you might not have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one thats compatible.  You could just boot off ide.  I'd also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; try the controller in another slot (on bus 0).
</EM><BR>
<P>I was hoping since the Symbios was NCR it would be supported. I
<BR>
have some old Symbios SCSI 2 narrow cards I could swap in. The
<BR>
built in SCSI is Qlogic but is an unhappy camper at the moment.
<BR>
I'll have to get the mainboard replaced to get that working
<BR>
again. Anyone know what models are supported or where docs are
<BR>
that tell?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    it appears SRM does not see it or any devices attached to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    it. Is there something I can set to get that recognized by SRM?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    I'm currently booting off the floppy until I get that fixed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    I'd like to boot from that card. Note AlphaBios does see the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    adapter. It is on Bus 0, so I guess it's not sitting across
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    a PCI bridge or anything odd like that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; For your amusement:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 996.15 BogoMIPS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Keep in mind the Bogus part of BogoMIPS. It does seem
<BR>
to indicate though that the 21264 is able to do two instructions
<BR>
per clock on the timing loop where as the 21164 only does one.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'd be more interested in stream numbers:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/">http://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>The streams tests are similar to parts of the benchmark I ran.
<BR>
All they are is about the simplest loops you can code. Not
<BR>
very representative of real code. I have seen old vector code
<BR>
that is like this though I doubt it's in production anymore. 
<BR>
But, they do stress memory if you use large enough arrays and 
<BR>
that I suppose is the point of the tests. Anyway, my tests that 
<BR>
are similar show nowhere near the speed up Compaq quotes on 
<BR>
their WWW site. I suspect the XP1000 has slow memory compared 
<BR>
to the DS20/DP264. Also, it could be gcc/g77 can't do simple 
<BR>
loops well yet and stall the pipeline. On the somewhat more 
<BR>
realistic tests, I see about 700 MFLOPS vs 456 MFLOPS on 21164. 
<BR>
Note the XP1000 is using egcs from RH5.2. I'm hoping egcs 1.1.2 
<BR>
will push that 700 up to high 800's or low 900's, low 900's 
<BR>
being preferred...
