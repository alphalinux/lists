<P><EM>&gt; Are there any caveats as far as upgrading glibc?  More specifically:

<P>Yes and no...

<P><EM>&gt; - Are new glibc libraries supposed to be backwards compatible with all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; old packages?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, however some libs will have to be recompiled (ncurses, most notably)
<BR>
and any binaries compiled on glibc-2.1 systems will not run on glibc-2.0.x
<BR>
systems.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - Are there stable vs unstable releases?
</EM><BR>
<P>The latest tarball should be ok, however I cannot vouch for the integrity
<BR>
of the RPMs available (I'm using Debian and working with our glibc
<BR>
maintainer to supply proper debs for glibc 2.1).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; failed dependencies:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         libcrypt.so.1.1(GLIBC_2.0) is needed by xscreensaver-3.07-3
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         libc.so.6.1(GLIBC_2.1) is needed by xscreensaver-3.07-3
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         libc.so.6.1(GLIBC_2.0) is needed by xscreensaver-3.07-3
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         libm.so.6.1(GLIBC_2.0) is needed by xscreensaver-3.07-3
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         libm.so.6.1(GLIBC_2.1) is needed by xscreensaver-3.07-3
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and then several things broke including &quot;ypbind&quot; and &quot;X&quot;.  Is this normal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or to be expected?
</EM><BR>
<P>There have been some changes in NIS support, so I would expect ypbind to
<BR>
break a bit (although, I haven't seen a breakage here).  As for the
<BR>
libcrypt problems, it's entirely possible that the RPM is not complete
<BR>
since our debs contain and supply libcrypt libs as expected.  Check the
<BR>
/lib dir and see if they are in there.  If not, then the RPM is
<BR>
incomplete.  If they are, then try recompiling xscreensaver (I don't use
<BR>
it, so I haven't run into that problem here)...the problems may be
<BR>
resolved through that route.
<BR>
<P>A side note: You'll probably need to recompile egcs (a recent snapshot
<BR>
would be ideal) and a few others (I'm redoing bash and ncurses now) to
<BR>
make sure things are workable on your system.
