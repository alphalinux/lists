This one takes the cake.  I wonder if he intentionally waited until after 
<BR>
Jon Postel passed away to take credit for his work.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Credit Where It's Due
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Declan McCullagh 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3:00 a.m.  11.Mar.99.PST
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON -- It's a time-honored tradition for presidential hopefuls
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to claim credit for other people's successes.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Al Gore as the father of the Internet?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's what the campaigner in chief told CNN's Wolf Blitzer during an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interview Tuesday evening. Blitzer asked Gore how he was different
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than other presumptive Democratic challengers, such as Bill Bradley.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What do you have to bring to this that he doesn't necessarily bring
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to this process?&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Replied Gore: &quot;I'll be offering my vision when my campaign begins, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it'll be comprehensive and sweeping, and I hope that it'll be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compelling enough to draw people toward it.... I've traveled to every
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;part of this country during the last six years.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the kicker: &quot;During my service in the United States
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huh?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary discussions of how the ARPANET would be designed began in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1967, and a request for proposals went out the following year. In
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1969, the Defense Department commissioned the ARPANET.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gore was 21-years-old at the time. He wasn't even done with law school
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at Vanderbilt University. It would be eight more years before Gore
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would be elected to the US House of Representatives as a freshman
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Democrat with scant experience in passing legislation, let alone
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ambitious proposals.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By that time, file copying -- via the UUCP protocol -- was beginning.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Email was flourishing. The culture of the Internet was starting to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;develop through the Jargon File and the SF-Lovers mailing list.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, politicians weren't completely unaware of the Internet.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to one account, when Senator Ted Kennedy learned in 1968
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that Massachusetts-based BBN had won the ARPA contract for an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;interface message processor,&quot; he sent a congratulatory telegram. It
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thanked the upstanding folks at BBN for their ecumenical spirit in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;devising an &quot;interfaith message processor.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blitzer, unfortunately, didn't appear to know any of that. After Gore
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;took credit for the Internet, Blitzer simply moved on talk about polls
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;showing Texas governor George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole ahead of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vice president.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gore has taken credit for popularizing the term &quot;information
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;superhighway&quot; and around 1991 penned related articles for publications
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such as Byte magazine. But the term &quot;data highway&quot; has been used as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;far back as 1975, before Gore entered Congress.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1990, Gore introduced a bill that would allow the federal
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;government to enter the business of crafting software for teachers to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use. Another Gore plan would create a new federal research center for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;educational computing to support an &quot;information systems highway.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the system he envisioned bears little resemblance to the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PC-dominated Internet.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Supercomputers are the steam locomotives of the information age,&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then-Senator Gore was quoted as saying in one article published in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1990. &quot;In the Industrial Age, steam locomotives didn't do much good
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until the railroad tracks were laid down across the nation. Similarly,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we now have supercomputers going into the seventh generation of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supercomputers, but we don't have the interstate highways that we need
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to connect them.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Within four years, the top-of-the-line US$20 million supercomputers
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will cost less than $400,000. A few years after that, they will be in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the $10,000 to $20,000 range.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the development of the Net has resembled less a government-managed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;industrial project -- such as the orderly interstate-highway systems
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gore hoped for -- and more an anarchic sprawl.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Gore played no positive role in the decisions that led to the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creation of the Internet as it now exists -- that is, in the opening
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the Internet to commercial traffic,&quot; said Steve Allen, vice
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;president for communications at the conservative Progress and Freedom
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foundation.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1993, Gore has become one of the most prominent people in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinton administration on issues related to high technology. He hosts
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;visiting businessmen and takes pride in personally announcing new
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;technology initiatives such as Internet II funding.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also took the lead in supporting the Clipper Chip and continued
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restrictions on the overseas shipments of encryption products.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High-visibility events can be prone to embarrassing slip-ups. At one
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recent White House event, Gore introduced Cisco Systems CEO John
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chambers, who he had met with privately earlier that day.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gore told the audience how much he valued Chambers and one of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;products Cisco produced. But he mispronounced &quot;routers&quot; as root-ers.
