<P>
FYI.
<BR>
<P>One of my UDBs went south.  It would spontaneously reboot either
<BR>
during the SRM bootstrap, or sometime while the system was running.
<BR>
It seemed like a power problem so I resigned myself to losing the
<BR>
box.  Before I gave up entirely, I opened the box, opened the power
<BR>
supply and beheld a substantial mass of cat fur and litter.  The cat
<BR>
would balance on the top of the UDB as it stood vertically.
<BR>
<P>Today, I got out a volt meter and checked the voltages coming from the
<BR>
power supply.  They're good.  I wiggled the connector.  Doing so
<BR>
showed the power light to flicker and the speaker to crackle--note
<BR>
that the speaker is connected to the motherboard through the power
<BR>
connector.  
<BR>
<P>So, I delicately pulled the pins from the power connector, lightly
<BR>
sanded them with 400 grit paper, lightly sanded the connector on the
<BR>
motherboard, and ha!  The machine boots and runs reliably.
<BR>
<P>The message is that Digital engineers appear to be pretty good at
<BR>
building cat-litter-proof power supplies.  %^)
