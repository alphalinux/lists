<EM>&gt; &gt; I've heard that the Ensoniq chip isn't fully PCI compliant -- something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; about incompletely implemented BARs (Base Address Registers, in PCI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; configuration space).  This makes sense in the context of working in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; some slots and not others; it would depend on what resources were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; assigned to the card.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'll ask the person who told me this for more details.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here's the story I got.  I was right about incompletely implemented
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; registers, but it wasn't the BARs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; First, the Ensoniq 1370 only implements four bits of the PCI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; configuration Interrupt Line register.  The PCI-savvy have already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; struck their foreheads and exclaimed &quot;DOH!&quot;; for those who haven't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yet made them familiar with all the details, this register is used by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the PCI configuration software to record the IRQ assigned to the card.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course four bits are sufficient on an obsolete computer architecture
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some of us may be familiar with, but Alpha systems have more IRQs and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thus need more bits.
</EM><BR>
<P>4 bits would only encode values 0-15, so does that imply that the es137?'s
<BR>
need an interrupt vector of 15 or less?  On my LX164 alpha, &lt;15 is assigned
<BR>
to the ISA bridge (I think...) the lowest IRQ I can get for the thing is
<BR>
16...  lspci -v reports:
<BR>
00:06.0 Class 0401: 1274:5000 (rev 01)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsystem: 4942:4c4c
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flags: bus master, slow devsel, latency 32, IRQ 16
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I/O ports at 8800
<BR>
Does this mean that when the card is done playing a block, it issues an
<BR>
interrupt DIFFERENT than 16?  I can see how that might cause a hang if the
<BR>
interrupt was used by a different piece of hardware.  Any sane interrupt
<BR>
handler should handle the spurious interrupt case though, so I suspect your
<BR>
second &quot;quirk&quot; below.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What this means is that a driver that connects to an interrupt based on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information read from this register may connect to the wrong interrupt.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I confess I haven't traced this down in the source code, so I'm not sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in detail what the implications are for Linux.  Since the IRQ assigned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the card depends on the slot it is in, this could conceivably explain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some of the slot-related problems people have reported.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Second, both the 1370 and 1371 are incapable of handling burst
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transactions as a target on the PCI bus.  The way they terminate the burst
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; violates the PCI specification, and thus they hang the bus.  On Alpha, any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quadword access to one of these chips is guaranteed to hang the system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Multiple accesses without an intervening mb may hang the system (this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; depends very much on other intervening accesses).
</EM><BR>
<P>Ugh.  Now I wish I hadn't bought one of these beasts.  How does one acheive
<BR>
quadword transactions (4*16-bit=64-bit) on the 32-bit PCI bus?  If quadword
<BR>
transactions are being used, it must be by the DMA chip, since the driver
<BR>
never does any direct data transfer with the card.
<BR>
<P>Looks like the fix to this will involve pouring over the PCI spec, and the
<BR>
DMA chip's spec.  Too bad all this info isn't in the ES1370 docs.  But of
<BR>
course, what chip manufacturer is going to put &quot;our chip violates all known
<BR>
standards&quot; right in their documentation?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Finally, there may be some difficulty with the 1371 on Tsunami-based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systems (i.e., all EV6 systems to date).  This is still under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; investigation.
</EM><BR>
<P>thanks for the help,
<BR>
