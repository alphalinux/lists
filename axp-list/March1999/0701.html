Hello all,
<BR>
<P>Some time ago I could get my hands on a 166
<BR>
alpha.
<BR>
Some poeple told me it is a Multia.
<BR>
But I know NOTHING about alpha systems, but really
<BR>
nothing at all!!
<BR>
The people from who I got this from neither...(they just used a program
<BR>
that WAS
<BR>
installed on the HDD. But the people who installed it, deleted it again (or
<BR>
formatted the HDD)
<BR>
I took a look at the hardware:
<BR>
I got three terminals (VT520), three keyboards and one 'server',  i got
<BR>
just enough
<BR>
kable to connect one terminal to the server.(The rest is cut for reuse)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About that calbe:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on one side I got a 25 pins male connector (pin 4and 5 connected
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and 6 and 20 connected together) on the other side a 9 pins fe-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;male (pins 4 and 6 connected together)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connections from the 25 to the 9 pin are: 2-3 3-2 7-5
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IS THIS CORRECT??
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not could someone tell me the correct connections?
<BR>
<P>One SCSI-HDD (1G)
<BR>
One HP SureStoreDisk 1000S
<BR>
A bit of RAM and an ethernetcard.
<BR>
I connected the keyboard to the back of the terminal with a PS2 kind of
<BR>
plug and 
<BR>
the terminal to the server by the kable specified above.
<BR>
When I startup I see 'Selftest OK' on the terminal.When I press a key,on
<BR>
the top
<BR>
left a blinking cursor and on the bottom left a '1' .
<BR>
At that stage I can't type anything. The only thing that I get is when I
<BR>
press F3 and that is a SET-UP (Actions; Sessions;...) there I can play a
<BR>
bit with the arrowkeys.
<BR>
Now my questions are:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lock on front of the tower but it's locked and I got no key,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is it alright to cut the two little cables and just connect them 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;together?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howcome I can't type anything?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I access the HDD's or how do I know they are formatted?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that cable that I use to connect the terminal to the server correct?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a distinction between the terminals if they were used for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;different
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;purposses (I mean programmed in the terminal directly) so that I have
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to find the one they used to boot with?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When booting the red and green lights on the removable HDD keep
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burning, is that normal?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got REDHAT5.2 delux edition; is this one corrcet for installing linux 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on an Alpha system?(I still got 5 days to return it)
<BR>
I need some good books on Alpha systems, Linux on Alpha..... . I got some 
<BR>
HOWTO's but nothing is as good as a book. Got some titles?
<BR>
<P>Thanx for the help and sorry for all these questions...
<BR>
Greetings
<BR>
