<EM>&gt; I use Afterstep on my (166, 64M) Multia.  Just make sure you use low-color

<EM>&gt; icons/themes on that built-in TGA card.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed. 
<BR>
<P>I used the 8-bit TGA video on my UDB at 1152x868, and all works well..
<BR>
you do have to know what you are doing when you configure your theme
<BR>
though, to keep the color usage reasonable. I've been using X on 8-bit
<BR>
video machines for awhile, so I have had a lot of practice at this.
<BR>
<P>In short, xv is your friend. Dither your images to the standard colormap
<BR>
and you can't go wrong. 
<BR>
<P>I like a bit of eye-candy here and there. I have a background image
<BR>
(dithered to std. color) and I use Eterm with pixmap backgrounds (also
<BR>
dithered to the std. map). Everything looks decent, is readable and
<BR>
easy to see, and nothing (ok, except Gimp) complains about the color map.
<BR>
<P>Not as nice as my 24-bit console, of course.. where I can just throw
<BR>
any image I like at it, but it is ok. 
<BR>
<P>I have the exact same config on my UDB as I have on my laptop. fvwm is
<BR>
my wm; I don't get fancy with all that.. X is just a really snazzy
<BR>
&quot;screen&quot; for playing with xterms as far as I'm concerned.
<BR>
<P>Now that I think about it, the fanciest wm that I've ever really run
<BR>
(aside from setting up a really old pre 1.0 beta of KDE to check it out)
<BR>
is Afterstep 1.0, which is still on my Pentium. 
<BR>
<P>I'd run AS 1.0 on all my machines, actually.. but I've since lost the
<BR>
source, and AS 1.0 is long gone, so all I have is the binary tarball
<BR>
that I put together for myself awhile back out of the scraps in /usr/local
<BR>
<P>I try to stay close to my roots.. windows/guis are to be distrusted,
<BR>
and terminals are to be loved (DEC VT100's, of course)
<BR>
<P>:)

&quot;Our merchants and master-manufacturers complain much of the bad effects
<BR>
of high wages in raising the price, and thereby lessening the sale of
<BR>
their goods both at home and abroad.  They say nothing concerning the bad
<BR>
effects of high profits.  They are silent with regard to the pernicious
<BR>
effects of their own gains.&quot; - Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations, Book I Chap. IX.
