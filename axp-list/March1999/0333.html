<EM>&gt; &gt; :) Hehheh.. thereby admitting that overclocking a CPU is ok so long as you

<EM>&gt; &gt; cool it well.

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; Actually, I would think, it doesn't work very *long* under those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circumstances. Probably they tried it only for a few hours to make the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; claim, I'd bet it won't last this way for weeks or even month.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, I agree. It's been awhile since I looked at the effects of
<BR>
overclocking, but IIRC, the basic relationship is inversely exponential..
<BR>
the higher you o/c, the less time the machine will work for.. with
<BR>
the cooling affecting the derivative of the relationship.
<BR>
<P>I've been running my P5 (rated at 150 MHz) at 200 MHz happily for about 
<BR>
8 months or so. As soon as the price for 200 MHz CPU's dropped, I o/c'd
<BR>
on the idea that if my proc dies, I can easily buy a new one.. and if it
<BR>
lasts at 200 MHz long enough so that I simply can't get P5 processors
<BR>
anymore, then I have gotten more than my money's worth.
<BR>
<P>Though, when it dies.. I'll be sad to see it go.. It's a classic jalopy
<BR>
machine, hacked together from the remains of a few 386 and 486's ..
<BR>
along with a few IDE drives that never did work quite right, and speedy
<BR>
2x proprietary CDROM drive.. all of which is dumped into a full
<BR>
tower case and glued together with Linux. Every variant of Windows
<BR>
crashes pretty hard on it, but Linux works just fine ;)
<BR>
<P>I'd like to o/c my UDB .. but, that would be a really major chore. Once
<BR>
I get a new Alpha, I'll o/c the UDB on principle, I guess.
