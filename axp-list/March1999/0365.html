<P>
The recent talk on-list about modems on the Alpha got me thinking..	
<BR>
<P>I have a Pentium that houses my old internal 14.4, and this box
<BR>
does IP masq'ing for me to feed internet access to my UDB and a
<BR>
few other machines. 14.4 has been fine for me, I prefer lynx for
<BR>
web browsing, so the slow speed has never much affected me. 
<BR>
<P>Well, I am now planning on putting a few other machines on the
<BR>
10b2 net in my house, these are Windows boxes and will be using Netscape
<BR>
a lot. 14.4 isn't going to cut it :) So I've been thinking of getting
<BR>
a nice new 56k modem.
<BR>
<P>I'd like to get an external so that I can put it on a UDB and have it
<BR>
do the IP masqing for me, since I occasionaly like to reboot my Pentium
<BR>
to DOS to play a game. 
<BR>
<P>I have never had a modem in any of my UDBs, and I'm wondering what the
<BR>
best sort of modem is for it.
<BR>
<P>Should I go with an external modem, if so is the UDB's serial port
<BR>
hardware robust enough to handle this well? How do I keep MILO from
<BR>
chatting with the modem forever? 
<BR>
<P>Or would it be better to go with a PCMCIA modem? I know that these modems
<BR>
will be far more expensive, but I have a few laptops around that I could
<BR>
plug it in to along with the UDB, so I don't have a problem spending the
<BR>
extra money if it will give a bit better performance.
