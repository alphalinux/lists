Gentlemen,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A number of programs are designed to grab memory and hang onto it based on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; events that occur.  Some grab a pretty big chunk at the initialization
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; phase while others try to play nice and only grab chucks as requirements
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dictate.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, but what Matt's system is experiencing is completely normal.  
<BR>
See below.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Review your list of deamons and see where the memory is being used.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;daemons&quot; - the BSD people would have your head in a basket if
<BR>
they ever saw that spelling of the word :-)  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; munch:mnelson&gt; free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;              total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Mem:        515112     506632       8480      34744      27728     454752
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; -/+ buffers/cache:      24152     490960
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Swap:       523640        232     523408
</EM><BR>
<P>And let's compare this to my system with 128M ram:
<BR>
[[dfrasnel@relativity /tmp]$ free
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
<BR>
Mem:        127312     115416      11896      73936      13832      61216
<BR>
-/+ buffers/cache:      40368      86944
<BR>
Swap:       131064        632     130432
<BR>
<P>If you look at both of these 'free' outputs, you will notice that a good 
<BR>
amount of memory is tied up in both cached and shared memory allocation.
<BR>
My system shows approx. 11M of physical memory free.  However, if I were to 
<BR>
launch Netscape 4.51 (memory footprint of what, 30M?) I could do so
<BR>
without dipping into swap space.  This is one of many beautiful features of
<BR>
Linux  - I'll leave it at that without ruining the moment by dissecting the
<BR>
mechanism :-)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only time you should be concerned about how much memory is available
<BR>
(per the output of free, top, etc.) is when your swap space is almost run
<BR>
out yet the machine is doing &quot;nothing&quot;.  At that point, you probably have a 
<BR>
process out of control (memory leak likely) and not addressing the problem 
<BR>
leads to a system crash or at best, serious drop in responsiveness. 
<BR>
<P>Best regards,
<BR>
Daniel
