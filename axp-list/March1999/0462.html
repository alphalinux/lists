<EM>&gt; I've heard that the Ensoniq chip isn't fully PCI compliant -- something

<EM>&gt; about incompletely implemented BARs (Base Address Registers, in PCI

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some slots and not others; it would depend on what resources were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assigned to the card.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'll ask the person who told me this for more details.
</EM><BR>
<P>Here's the story I got.  I was right about incompletely implemented
<BR>
registers, but it wasn't the BARs.
<BR>
<P>First, the Ensoniq 1370 only implements four bits of the PCI
<BR>
configuration Interrupt Line register.  The PCI-savvy have already
<BR>
struck their foreheads and exclaimed &quot;DOH!&quot;; for those who haven't
<BR>
yet made them familiar with all the details, this register is used by
<BR>
the PCI configuration software to record the IRQ assigned to the card.
<BR>
Of course four bits are sufficient on an obsolete computer architecture
<BR>
some of us may be familiar with, but Alpha systems have more IRQs and
<BR>
thus need more bits.
<BR>
<P>What this means is that a driver that connects to an interrupt based on
<BR>
information read from this register may connect to the wrong interrupt.
<BR>
I confess I haven't traced this down in the source code, so I'm not sure
<BR>
in detail what the implications are for Linux.  Since the IRQ assigned
<BR>
to the card depends on the slot it is in, this could conceivably explain
<BR>
some of the slot-related problems people have reported.
<BR>
<P>Second, both the 1370 and 1371 are incapable of handling burst
<BR>
transactions as a target on the PCI bus.  The way they terminate the burst
<BR>
violates the PCI specification, and thus they hang the bus.  On Alpha, any
<BR>
quadword access to one of these chips is guaranteed to hang the system.
<BR>
Multiple accesses without an intervening mb may hang the system (this
<BR>
depends very much on other intervening accesses).
<BR>
<P>Finally, there may be some difficulty with the 1371 on Tsunami-based
<BR>
systems (i.e., all EV6 systems to date).  This is still under
<BR>
investigation.
