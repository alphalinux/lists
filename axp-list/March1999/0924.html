<P>
It seems to me that a lot of people have been caught by the Intel marketing
<BR>
scheme.  The clock rate for a cpu is just one of several factors that are needed
<BR>
to know its true benefits.  The only time that the clock speed should be used by
<BR>
itself is when comparing chips of the same design.  Comparing a PII 233 with a
<BR>
P233 is not right because they have different amounts of cache and differences
<BR>
in architecture (RISC/CISC).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I am interesting in finding out about the state-of-the-art hardware
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and Compaq UK doesn't seem to know much.  They have only 500MHz
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; machines on sale currently.  I recall seeing someone mention some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 667MHz alpha's on this list, or was I just dreaming?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alphas come with 2 different generations of CPUs at many different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speeds. The latest and greatest is the XP1000 box, with a 21264 cpu at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 500 mhz. I'm not sure if you can buy faster 21264-based boxes yet. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; previous generation is the 21164 chip. Your PC164LX has this chip, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; indeed you can buy them at 533, 600, or 667 mhz. Compaq should be able
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to show you benchmarks for various machines; the 21264 is much faster
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than the 21164 at the same clock speed at most tasks.
