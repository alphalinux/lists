<P>
<EM>&gt; Will this machiene run X, StarOffice, WP8 and all that good stuff? Like I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; said I am into learning....
</EM><BR>
<P>X support is TGA only, no commercial apps, and basicly bad for starters
<BR>
like you. I recommended that you either snatch up one of those multias
<BR>
on ebay or wait till the K7/21264 reaches mass production this summer
<BR>
and pick up am SX or LX for almost nothing. Tax refunds are coming soon
<BR>
ya know :)
