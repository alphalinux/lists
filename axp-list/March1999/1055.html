<EM>&gt; I don't think this is going to happen however, as we are seeing that the XP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is really not a great machine, with severe memory bandwidth and quality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; control issues.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with the QC/repair issue. It's tough getting a service tech who
<BR>
works on PC's to understand what you're talking about for the XP1000.
<BR>
Still waiting on them to respond to my request for a new mainboard.
<BR>
<P>So far, I've found the memory bandwidth problem to be two edged.
<BR>
First, it is tied to smart compilers. egcs isn't quite up to the
<BR>
task for certain code styles. egcs can however do quite well with
<BR>
the &quot;right&quot; style of code. I've already mentioned some of those 
<BR>
problems in other posts. The second issue is the bandwidth of the
<BR>
XP1000 memory subsystem. It is not as fast as the DP264, which the
<BR>
SPECFP/stream and my own tests show to be true. It is however, pretty
<BR>
fast in general so overall, I'd say it's a reasonable box. (now that
<BR>
the kernel is stable!!)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And in a couple of months we shall see the newer SlotB designs from Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Processor and AMD affiliates coming to market, at which time the 21264 will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; become an affordable alternative for the market.
</EM><BR>
<P>I hope API does some work on the memory subsystem to get it
<BR>
faster, hopefully staying with commodity parts.
<BR>
<P>AMD in general is a bit worrisome since they keep losing money
<BR>
every time they start up a new chip series.
