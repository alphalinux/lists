<EM>&gt; &gt; If you look at both of these 'free' outputs, you will notice that a good 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; amount of memory is tied up in both cached and shared memory allocation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; My system shows approx. 11M of physical memory free.  However, if I were to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; launch Netscape 4.51 (memory footprint of what, 30M?) I could do so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; without dipping into swap space.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what you say is true, but i was more concerned with the -/+ buffers/cache
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; line of the free(1) output.  that line, if i understand it correctly,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; indicates what your are using and have available if you dont count buffers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and cache.  in your example, it shows that you have about 40M used and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about 87M free.  *those* are the numbers that i'm wondering about.  on my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machine, the -/+ buffers/cache used climbs to ~110M during the activity of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the day, then drops down to ~25M during the night.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when i compare the 110M to the output of &quot;ps axm&quot; during a quiet time in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the day (i.e., no user jobs running), i see that the the total memory used
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't seem to add up to the 110M that free(1) indicates.  and yes, X has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the biggest memory footprint on an idle machine...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at first i thought there was a memory leak somewhere, but when it went
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; back down to something reasonable over night, i figure that i must not be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understanding something.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any other ideas?

<P>We've seen this kind of effect repeatedly on our various Alpha/Linux
<BR>
boxes.  Often, as was pointed out, it has no real negative effects.
<BR>
But we've definitely had cases where we couldn't start up certain
<BR>
applications any more, or could not even telnet into the system any more.
<BR>
<P>Often, it seems that network-related processes contribute to this
<BR>
behavior, especially if there's a problem with the network, or some faulty
<BR>
network setup etc.  We've had cases where a 512 MB machine came up with 
<BR>
4 kB free memory after RPC'ing like crazy during boot-up.
<BR>
<P>Without being experts in this, we've attributed this to some kind of
<BR>
memory fragmentation caused by processes that may be long dead, and which
<BR>
is possibly not cleaned up optimally.  The size of the swap space seems to
<BR>
play an important role here:  with swap space smaller than physical
<BR>
memory, it appears that the system has more difficulties moving large
<BR>
applications (and buffers etc.?) in and out of memory without causing
<BR>
memory fragmentation.  After setting swap space to at least physical RAM
<BR>
size on all machines, this problem has become much less frequent.
<BR>
<P>Be that as it may, we've solved this problem by writing a little &quot;RAM
<BR>
scrubber&quot; application that allocates, and actually accesses, progressively
<BR>
larger chunks of memory, up to a user-defined limit (it doesn't pay much
<BR>
to go all the way into swap space, obviously).  This little program has
<BR>
solved the above problems for us in all cases.
<BR>
<P>An example I just ran on one of our Alphas:
<BR>
<P>&quot;before&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
<BR>
Mem:        515320     506744       8576      14880     383880      13424
<BR>
-/+ buffers:           109440     405880
<BR>
Swap:       590176        144     590032
<BR>
<P>&quot;after&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
<BR>
Mem:        515320      12264     503056       5216        208       3184
<BR>
-/+ buffers:             8872     506448
<BR>
Swap:       590176       1992     588184
<BR>
<P><P>If there's interest, I can post this program here.
<BR>
<P>(BTW, this effect doesn't seem to be unique to Alpha/Linux.  We've seen it
<BR>
on x86/Linux as well as SGI IRIX, albeit to some lesser extent.  In any
<BR>
event, we've installed our little &quot;RAM scrubber&quot;, or &quot;fragbuster&quot;,
<BR>
program, on *all* our Linux/Unix systems.)
<BR>
<P>Hope this was of some use,
<BR>
