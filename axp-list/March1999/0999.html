Hello all!
<BR>
Quiet some time ago I reported that the MPEG-I player from MpegTV (MTV)
<BR>
keeps crashing on my 164SX 533MHz machine using various versions of kernels
<BR>
and libc. Up until now I could not reproduce the effect with any other
<BR>
application so I thought, OK, live with it. Some time later other users
<BR>
reported exactly the same oddities with 164SX boards and MTV. On the
<BR>
baseline it seems that some kind of memory corruption occurs when mtv (or
<BR>
mtvp) and some other load sucking application were running. My test was and
<BR>
is to run mtv and compile a kernel. This results in crashing of mtv
<BR>
(seg-fault or illegal instruction) or compiler (typically sig 11, sometimes
<BR>
illegal instruction).
<BR>
This description allone does not tell much about the problem and since I
<BR>
could not reproduce the effect I kept quiet until now!
<BR>
<P>Today I tried x11amp on my 164SX and see ... it causes exactly the same
<BR>
effect! Either x11amp itself crashes at random times or other processes
<BR>
suddenly vanish! And tell you what: kernel compile crashes again!
<BR>
So where is the connection between mtv and x11amp?
<BR>
<P>Both use X11.
<BR>
Both use the audio device.
<BR>
Both use threads &lt;- my favourite cause for faults!
<BR>
<P>I then tried x11amp on a remote display and the effect is still there so the
<BR>
XFree server cannot be the reason. Still in the game: audio device and
<BR>
threads. Since I never had any similar problem when using any kind of audio
<BR>
application I think we can eliminate that too.
<BR>
So the last guess are the threads.
<BR>
My current setup (the IMHO relevant parts):
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;kernel 2.1.131
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;glibc-2.0.7-29 from RedHat 5.2
<BR>
<P>So here we are again ... any ideas?
<BR>
Is anyone else able to report problems with threads on 164SX boards?
<BR>
Or maybe this is a CPU problem and all 21164PC users could be affected?
<BR>
Are there any other programs out there that toggle this effect?
<BR>
And last but not least: Is there a fix? (and don't tell not to use x11amp,
<BR>
mtv or such multimedia applications ...)
<BR>
Has anything relevant to threads changed from kernel 2.1.131 to 2.2.3?
<BR>
<P>OK. Thanks for your attention ;)
