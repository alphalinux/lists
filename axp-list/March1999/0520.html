<P>
I'm getting a CIA machine check, vector 0x660, reason = 0x21E = corrected
<BR>
ECC error (this is with pc164 MILO, which uses the eb164 codes, yes?).
<BR>
<P>The trouble is I get an infinite number of them in a row, so apparently,
<BR>
the error is not getting cleared before the handler returns.
<BR>
<P>The symptom is the system locks up hard, but if you happen to be in the
<BR>
console window (i.e. not running X), you can see the machine checks going
<BR>
by (but they never get written to the log and the keyboard is dead).
<BR>
<P>What is the proper way to clear the error?  Do I reset the bit and
<BR>
write it back to the CIA_IOC_CIA_ERR register (or clear all the bits)?
<BR>
Just doing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrmces(rdmces());       /* reset machine check pending flag */
<BR>
in core_cia.c doesn't appear to cut it.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps interrupts are not getting turned back on correctly?
<BR>
<P>(I noticed a FIX ME in the palcode where it suggests distinguishing
<BR>
between corrected errors and uncorrected ones.  Perhaps that's the place
<BR>
to ignore this, but going back to the kernel so a printk() can be done
<BR>
to log that the error occurred is good.)
<BR>
<P>I'm assuming of course that this machine check is safe to ignore?
<BR>
Oddly, it's semi-reproducible -- it happens while writing to SCSI disk
<BR>
through an adaptec controller, so perhaps I have a problem there, although
<BR>
I swapped the adaptec for an identical one and the machine check is still
<BR>
reproducible with dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/moo count=large over and over.
<BR>
(I only have one internal disk.)
<BR>
<P>Dr. Tom Holroyd
<BR>
I would dance and be merry,
<BR>
Life would be a ding-a-derry,
<BR>
If I only had a brain.
