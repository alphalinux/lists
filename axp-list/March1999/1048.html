<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Wes Bauske&quot; said:

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1. The main board has a 21142 built in that tulip
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    seems unable to run properly. In particular, tulip
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    wants to believe that my 100Mb hub is 10Mb. Also,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    since this is a kernel from gatekeeper, it appears
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    tulip is built in, not a module since lsmod doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    show anything. So, I'm off downloading the latest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    2.2.3 kernel to see if I can get this puppy to behave.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Has anyone gotten 21142's to behave and was it tulip
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    or de4x5? Also what version of the driver and any parms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    to set. If I can't find a working version, I will see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    about disabling the onboard 21142 and installing a 21140
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    based adapter.
</EM><BR>
<P>Couple of points:
<BR>
<P>a. sometimes, esp. with 100Mbit on 21142/21143, one has to resort to boot
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;line args to force the tulip.c driver to handle a specific media type;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;check Becker's webpages WRT how this gets done.
<BR>
<P>b. AFAIK, the last de4x5.c driver I tried on XP1000 didn't like the new
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chipset (21143-PD or -TD, I can't remember which); this may have been
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;updated since, so it would be worth a try via modules.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2. I seem to have either heat problems or the memory dimms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    are not up to standard. I can't get the latest egcs1.1.2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    to go thru a full build. It builds fine on my 164LX. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    get either core dumps at what appear to be random places
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    or I get a message something like &quot;Unable to dup fd xxxxxxxx
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    to fd 0&quot; while trying to copy the files to the installed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    location. The first location looks obviously bogus.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Anyone seen that before??
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, and I'd say it's not memory-related, I see it on a DP264 as well,
<BR>
and with older (1.0.3a) compilers. I suspect it's a bug in the EV6 support
<BR>
around TLB/cache; I never saw this with older (2.1.120 vintage) kernels,
<BR>
but ever since 2.1.130 or thereabouts, it's been annoying.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3. I added a Symbios 875J based UW SCSI to the system and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    it appears SRM does not see it or any devices attached to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    it. Is there something I can set to get that recognized by SRM?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    I'm currently booting off the floppy until I get that fixed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    I'd like to boot from that card. Note AlphaBios does see the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    adapter. It is on Bus 0, so I guess it's not sitting across
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    a PCI bridge or anything odd like that.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm guessing that that's one of the NT-only cards; Intraserver has 2 models,
<BR>
using the NCR 875 chip, one of which doesn't work under DU, I'm told. I don't
<BR>
know why, but seem to remember something about shared interrupts? Sorry...
