Hi,
<BR>
<P>It seems I'm getting close to get my stuff working on my SX.
<BR>
But in fact this task requires much more RAM which I need
<BR>
and I can afford for my own machine. This task is for project
<BR>
and that project has some budget :-) I contacted local
<BR>
supercomputer facilities but their requirement to sign
<BR>
a contract for 4 years minimum (with price about several $K
<BR>
each) doesn't seem terrible attractive to me. So, I'd be
<BR>
happy to promote AlphaLinux machine if I'd be able to find
<BR>
good prices. There is NO modern Unix machines at all
<BR>
in my University which can help so I'll definetely need
<BR>
to buy something and the only competitor I see so far
<BR>
is a Pentium Linux :-) I'm writing this message from a PII350,
<BR>
which isn't too bad but we have hard time trying to get its RAM
<BR>
at least above 512MB  (prices for 256MB modules I've
<BR>
got from European suppliers are about $1K each).
<BR>
<P>So, if anyone has any info about systems with 4-8 GB RAM
<BR>
I'd be very happy to hear about it.
<BR>
<P>Thank you very much for your help,
<BR>
Rgds,
<BR>
<P>Andrei
