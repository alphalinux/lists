<EM>&gt; &gt; The hack of raising the ISA_DMA_THRESHHOLD will make the SCSI code
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; work. What other drivers dma to user buffers? My myrinet networking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; card does, but supposedly normal video and networking cards do not.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, the sound drivers prolly can. How about the DMA-capable IDE drivers?
</EM><BR>
<P>A quick spin through the IDE code says that it has no bounce buffer
<BR>
stuff -- I wonder how ISA IDE cards work? I guess there aren't any ISA
<BR>
IDE cards that do DMA. Whereas the generic SCSI code is aware of ISA
<BR>
cards, and that's why we think this hack would work.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, it may be easy to add this to the IDE code. There
<BR>
is a routine ide_dmaproc which does all the work. In
<BR>
ide_build_dmatable we see if we need a bounce buffer, and copy write
<BR>
data. In ide_dmaproc for the ide_dma_end case, we copy the read data
<BR>
and free the bounce buffer. Or you can also modify
<BR>
ide-dma.c/ide_setup_dma() to always read to pages that are dma-able,
<BR>
and only have to bounce writes.  This would get all the generic
<BR>
devices; the ones with specific drivers will need similar
<BR>
modifications.
<BR>
<P>The sound code (drivers/sound/dmabuf.c) seems to always use GPF_DMA to
<BR>
get buffers, which isn't quite right, but won't bother us.
