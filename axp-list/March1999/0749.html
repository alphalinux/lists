<P>
I talked to Jakub Jelinek about the sparc64 support and it seems that
<BR>
the following hack will get AlphaLinux working with big memory and
<BR>
bounce buffers today:
<BR>
<P>1) Increase CIA's memory window to as large as possible
<BR>
2) set unchecked_isa_dma = 1 in your SCSI drivers
<BR>
3) increase ISA_DMA_THRESHOLD to the size of the CIA memory region.
<BR>
<P>Recompile and enjoy - 2&amp;3 mean that existing SCSI drivers will start
<BR>
using bounce buffers. This breaks ISA card support (no big deal) and I
<BR>
haven't looked at the appropriate ide driver to see if it uses bounce
<BR>
buffers. This would also break my favorite network driver (myrinet).
<BR>
<P>You can test this in a small memory machine by _reducing_ the size of
<BR>
the CIA memory window.
<BR>
<P>Anyone want to give this a try?
