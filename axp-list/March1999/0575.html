<EM>&gt;&gt; ECC error (this is with pc164 MILO, which uses the eb164 codes, yes?).

<EM>&gt;&gt; The trouble is I get an infinite number of them in a row, so apparently,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; the error is not getting cleared before the handler returns.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Was this with the latest MILO, ie from RH 5.2?
</EM><BR>
<P>That's a good question.  The version of MILO I have says PC164, built
<BR>
against 2.0.35, Oct. 8.  I downloaded it from somewhere inside Digital's
<BR>
ftp pages; all I remember about that is that the HOWTO points at the wrong
<BR>
place, and the latest milos are well hidden.  The old one I had didn't
<BR>
work with the latest kernels, this one does.  I did have to experiment a
<BR>
bit because the manual for my box claims it's an AlphaPC164LX, but the
<BR>
lx164 milos don't work.  Anyhow, it certainly has a 21172...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; I'm assuming of course that this machine check is safe to ignore?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yes, except when it takes over the machine, of course... :-\
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, what I did this morning was to clear the COR_ERR bit in the ERR_MASK
<BR>
register, which means the 21172 will ignore corrected ECC errors.  That
<BR>
seems to have eliminated the problem (at least for now).  However, that's
<BR>
really just a band-aid -- the real problem is that the error wasn't
<BR>
handled properly in the first place -- it wasn't cleared, and when the
<BR>
handler returned it was getting called again instantly, locking the
<BR>
machine.  I may experiment later with the proper way to clear the error
<BR>
(writing zero to the CIA_ERR register is supposed to do it, and that
<BR>
isn't being done).  At least, I could print out the symptom byte, though
<BR>
I don't know what good that would do.  But ignoring it works.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Oddly, it's semi-reproducible -- it happens while writing to SCSI disk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; through an adaptec controller, so perhaps I have a problem there, although
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; I swapped the adaptec for an identical one and the machine check is still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; reproducible with dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/moo count=large over and over.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; (I only have one internal disk.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Which Adaptec? kernel?
</EM><BR>
<P>This is with an Adaptec 2940UW (though I have only narrow devices. :-(
<BR>
I've had the lockup occur with both 2.0.32 and 2.2.3, and a few others in
<BR>
between.  Not surprising, since the cia_machine_check() routine hasn't
<BR>
changed much.
<BR>
<P>The funny thing is the machine check code is coming back as a (platform
<BR>
specific) MCHK_K_CIA_0 (0x21E) rather than a MCHK_K_ECC_C.  The 0x21E
<BR>
corresponds to IRQ0, IPL 20, according to platform.h.  Perhaps it's
<BR>
not really an ECC error, but some spurious interrupt?  In any case the
<BR>
palcode seems to handle this the wrong way; the code that sets
<BR>
MCHK_K_ECC_C is never getting called -- but I have no idea what's going on
<BR>
throughout most of the palcode, so maybe this is correct. :-)

I would dance and be merry,
