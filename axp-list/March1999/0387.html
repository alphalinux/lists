<EM>&gt; Shudder!!!  Don't hardwire location of libraries that way in Makefiles.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is **stupid**!  You will find yourself why in not so distant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; future.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uhm... there are instances where you want to specify the absolute
<BR>
path of a static library, as you will find out in the not so distant future.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; First of all your compiler, nearly certainly, searches /usr/local/lib
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so -lcpml would be just great.  The second, if /usr/local/lib is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not searched by a compiler (not bloody likely) you can always ask
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for that using -L option.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two versions of libcpml on my system, one static and one
<BR>
shared.  Both are located in /usr/local/lib/.  Peter also has the
<BR>
same situation.  The shared libcpml has some 'issues', as I'm sure you are 
<BR>
aware.  As mentioned in my message, this patch was sent to Peter,
<BR>
so he could compile mpg123 linked against a static libcpml.  There
<BR>
are some cflags/ldopt(?) parameters I could set to get around this,
<BR>
but my assumption is that Pete does not have the same setup on his end. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You need to read closely and consider before jumping all 
<BR>
over someone.   I've only been hacking around with Un*x since 1992, so 
<BR>
perhaps you may consider me a 'newbie' or something.
<BR>
Regards,
<BR>
Daniel
