<P>
Here, de-Wordified and heavily excerpted, are some passages from Compaq's
<BR>
announcement about their support for Linux.  I removed the marketing
<BR>
buzz (which shortened the announcement significantly) and also deleted
<BR>
Compaq's claims to be responsible for support (such as donating Linus's
<BR>
first Alpha system) that really came from Digital Equipment Corporation.
<BR>
Despite their attempts at historical revisionism, I think they're to
<BR>
be commended for the direction they're taking.  Next thing you know,
<BR>
they'll be releasing source for CPML and em86 :-)

<P><P>HOUSTON, March 2, 1999 
<BR>
<P>Compaq Computer Corporation today announced the availability of ProLiant
<BR>
1850R, ProLiant 1600 and ProSignia 720 servers preloaded with Linux
<BR>
through Compaq's channel partners.  Earlier this year Compaq announced a
<BR>
similar Linux-ready capability with the AlphaServer 800 and AlphaServer
<BR>
DS20 systems.
<BR>
<P>Further adding to its portfolio of Linux offerings, Compaq also announced
<BR>
the availability of Linux-enabled models of the AlphaPowered Compaq
<BR>
Professional Workstation XP1000, the world's fastest workstation.
<BR>
<P>Today, Linus Torvalds received an AlphaServer DS20 from Compaq, which
<BR>
he will use as his development platform for Linux.
<BR>
<P>Compaq further boosted the unmatched performance of its AlphaServer 800,
<BR>
AlphaServer DS20 and Professional Workstation XP1000 systems running Linux
<BR>
by introducing the Compaq Portable Math Library (CPML) for Linux on the
<BR>
Alpha platform.  A beta version of CPML will be available free on March
<BR>
15, 1999 at the following URL: http:www.unix.digital.com/linux/cpml.htm.
<BR>
<P>Compaq has performed hardware validation and certification for Linux on
<BR>
select Alpha and ProLiant server platforms and will provide customers
<BR>
with Linux-ready systems including the option of preloaded Linux from
<BR>
Compaq's channel partners. Additionally, Compaq Services and Red Hat
<BR>
have agreed to collaborate on services for their mutual customers.
<BR>
<P>To further ease the deployment and installation of Linux on its platforms,
<BR>
Compaq will announce new Linux-focused ActiveAnswers solutions in 2Q99.
<BR>
Compaq ActiveAnswers provides online tools and technical information
<BR>
to plan, deploy and operate business solutions.  These solutions will
<BR>
enable Compaq channel partners and customers to access the latest
<BR>
recommended configurations and installation methodologies for Linux on
<BR>
Compaq platforms.  For more information on Compaq ActiveAnswers, visit
<BR>
