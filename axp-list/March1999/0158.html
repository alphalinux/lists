<EM>&gt; a bit more intimately and having the logistics of cause-and-effect down (no

<P>Well, it was luck in a sense.  I just happened to have my foxglove
<BR>
potpourri on the computer stand (the cleaning crew was in today), and it
<BR>
removing the motherboard, I *did* stub my toe -- jumping around on one
<BR>
leg in a motion that in *retrospect* was highly correlated to the
<BR>
native America Wohoohoo dance.  I'll just have to count my blessings
<BR>
(and try not to complain too much about the sudden change in weather
<BR>
that we're experiencing in the pan-handle today).
<BR>
<P>And it's not even the 5th day of Sorrow (ddate(1) tells me it's
<BR>
Boomtime, (62nd day of Chaos in the YOLD 3165))!
