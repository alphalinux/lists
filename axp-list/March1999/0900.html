</EM><BR>
<P>True. The TurboChannel is not supported, although some work was spent on it,
<BR>
IIRC. And even if it was, you have strange graphics adapters, and you will
<BR>
have trouble to find an X-Serve to run on it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you get the machine you'll need to run NetBSD?? (One of the BSDs will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; run on this, not sure which one).

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; X will run fine on any supported Alpha (not the 3000 series of course).
</EM><BR>
<P>Your VGA/MGA/TGA/whatever has to be supported by XFree86 or Accel-X.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; StarOffice is not on Alpha, though ApplixWare is, WP8 is Intel only, though I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; read reports from a couple of guys within Compaq that they have it running
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; under em86, I've also heard that Corel might port it to Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<P>... and while Linux-Alpha runs Digital Unix binaries, you still have trouble
<BR>
to get them working, cause you need a license for the shared libraries. Note
<BR>
that you need a 2.2 kernel for DUX-4.x binaries.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As for speed of the Multia (166MHz) it think a P90 is about right. I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a P100 and it keeps up with that most of the time. Kernel compiles take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; longer, but I don't see that as a problem. The Multia is a good box to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; learn/play with, and the best part is they are cheap :)
</EM><BR>
<P>My feeling is that the alphas are as fast as their intel counterparts when
<BR>
compared with the same MHz (This was a comparison of a axp21164-266 against
<BR>
a PII-266). For floating point, the alpha is much stronger. On the other
<BR>
hand, I don't know about the old 21064 chips.
<BR>
<P>Compiling is always slower on the alpha. It's a RISC and the compiler has
<BR>
much more work to do to get reasonable code produced. (More instructions to
<BR>
be generated, less dense code, more issues wrt instruction scheduling, ...)
<BR>
Also your binaries are larger by a factor of 1.5, so your memory and disk
<BR>
subsystem have to perform a little bit better to keep up with intel ...
<BR>
<P>Regards,
