<EM>&gt; OK. I have Linux mostly installed on the XP1000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that arrived today. I'm running into a couple problems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1. The main board has a 21142 built in that tulip
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    seems unable to run properly. In particular, tulip
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    wants to believe that my 100Mb hub is 10Mb. Also,
</EM><BR>
<P>Are you using a &quot;REAL&quot; cat 5 cable?  Or a home made?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    since this is a kernel from gatekeeper, it appears
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    tulip is built in, not a module since lsmod doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    show anything. So, I'm off downloading the latest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    2.2.3 kernel to see if I can get this puppy to behave.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Has anyone gotten 21142's to behave and was it tulip
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    or de4x5? Also what version of the driver and any parms
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd try both as modules.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    to set. If I can't find a working version, I will see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    about disabling the onboard 21142 and installing a 21140
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    based adapter.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats a worst case.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2. I seem to have either heat problems or the memory dimms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    are not up to standard. I can't get the latest egcs1.1.2
</EM><BR>
<P>Are you using this stock memory?  Did you add your own?  What
<BR>
exactly did you add?  What happens if it's stock only?  Any ecc
<BR>
memory errors in syslog?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    to go thru a full build. It builds fine on my 164LX. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    get either core dumps at what appear to be random places
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    or I get a message something like &quot;Unable to dup fd xxxxxxxx
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    to fd 0&quot; while trying to copy the files to the installed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    location. The first location looks obviously bogus.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Anyone seen that before??
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3. I added a Symbios 875J based UW SCSI to the system and
</EM><BR>
<P>There are a limited number of controllers supported in the bios,
<BR>
some ncr, qlogic, and adaptec.  I suspect you might not have
<BR>
one thats compatible.  You could just boot off ide.  I'd also
<BR>
try the controller in another slot (on bus 0).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    it appears SRM does not see it or any devices attached to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    it. Is there something I can set to get that recognized by SRM?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    I'm currently booting off the floppy until I get that fixed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    I'd like to boot from that card. Note AlphaBios does see the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    adapter. It is on Bus 0, so I guess it's not sitting across
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    a PCI bridge or anything odd like that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For your amusement:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 996.15 BogoMIPS
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd be more interested in stream numbers:
