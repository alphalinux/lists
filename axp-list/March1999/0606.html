First thing, buy.com /now/ says they will not send a replacement of the
<BR>
CDR media which they lost.  Stinks.
<BR>
Second, here's another one of Shriver's posts.  Someone also claims he is
<BR>
&quot;harassing&quot; them because they called his bluff on being a research
<BR>
associate.  I'll forward whatever I receive from that.

<P>As for the flames, I understand, there are a lot of &quot;starving college&quot;
<BR>
people who are too lazy to get a job to pay for a computer. But in
<BR>
reality, I have two jobs, and it bothers me when I hear stories about how
<BR>
company X upgrades all of their workstations and end up scrapping
<BR>
perfectly good equipment.
<BR>
<P>The intension of my leter was not to beg for people to give me their own
<BR>
equipment, but more of a &quot;hey if you are a big business that wants a tax
<BR>
write off of are going to throw it away, might as well give it to someone
<BR>
who needs it&quot;.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
Sincerely,
<BR>
