<P>
Jay points out that I should be a bit more clear:
<BR>
<P>1) My PCI bus example refers to a &quot;feature&quot;/bug in the previous
<BR>
generation Digital PCI chipsets that no one would have ever noticed if
<BR>
it wasn't for gigabit networking. Jay tells me that the new XP1000
<BR>
motherboards have been clocked very close to the maximum bandwidth
<BR>
with 64-bit PCI cards.
<BR>
<P>2) My PCI bus example was just an issue of &quot;peak verses actual&quot; and
<BR>
wasn't directly relevant to SCSI disks. A single SCSI controller can't
<BR>
max out the PCI bus anyway.
<BR>
<P>These days you can buy RAID systems that can begin to get close to the
<BR>
PCI bus peak bandwidth, but it's hard. One example with IDE RAID would
<BR>
be the systems at www.raidzone.com, which have &quot;bonnie&quot; results of 60
<BR>
megabytes/sec reads, which is 50% of the PCI peak. (They don't have an
<BR>
AlphaLinux driver, but they do have Intel Linux...)
