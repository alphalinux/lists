<P>
I'm having a few problems with ethernet connections between two machines.
<BR>
<P>One is a XL300 the other is a Cyrix i686 running at 200MHz. The XL300 is
<BR>
running 2.2.0-pre8 compiled with egcs-1.0.3 and the i686 is running the
<BR>
same kernel compiled with gcc 2.7.2.3. Both are compiled as modules.The
<BR>
ethernet card for the XL300 is the onboard DC21040 chip, /proc/pci:
<BR>
<P>PCI devices found:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bus  0, device   6, function  0:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethernet controller: DEC DC21040 (rev 36).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medium devsel.  Fast back-to-back capable.  IRQ 29.  Master Capable.  Latency=96.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I/O at 0x9000 [0x9001].
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0x9000000 [0x9000000].
<BR>
<P><P>And the card for the i686 is an Accton Cheetah Fast ethernet, /proc/pci:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bus  0, device  15, function  0:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethernet controller: DEC DC21142 (rev 48).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medium devsel.  Fast back-to-back capable.  IRQ 11.  Master Capable.  Latency=64.  Min Gnt=20.Max Lat=40.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I/O at 0xf400 [0xf401].
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xffae7f80 [0xffae7f80].
<BR>
<P>I have at one stage had these cards working quite well together (approx
<BR>
1Mbyte/s) but it seems it was just luck (and I can't remember how I did
<BR>
it).
<BR>
<P>If I use the de4x5 driver on the XL300 and the tulip (the de4x5 doesn't
<BR>
work on the i686) I can eventaully get them up and running by loading and
<BR>
unloading the module while the other machine is pinging it. At the moment
<BR>
I'm getting about 750 KBytes/s. I just swapped the tulip driver for the
<BR>
de4x5 driver and it still works with about same transfer rate. It seems to
<BR>
make a difference which machine is up first. If I then try to use the
<BR>
XL300 as an NFS serve, the client reports:
<BR>
<P>nfs: server mort not responding, still trying
<BR>
nfs: task 82 can't get a request slot
<BR>
<P>This is reported when trying to open an 8192 byte file.
<BR>
<P>I've set /etc/conf.modules to contain the following on both machines:
<BR>
<P>alias eth0 tulip
<BR>
options tulip options=12
<BR>
<P>There is no change if I change the  options to 9 or 11.
<BR>
<P>On the i686 the driver (I assume it's the driver as it's not in
<BR>
/var/log/messages nor `dmesg`) reports that the media is fixed at 10baseT
<BR>
(since this is a 10/100Mbit card) on the XL300 this is not reported.
<BR>
<P>tulip-diag (on the XL300 reports);

<P>tulip-diag.c:v1.08 2/28/99 Donald Becker (<A HREF="mailto:becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov?subject=Re:%20Tulip%20on%20XL300">becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov</A>)
<BR>
Index #1: Found a Digital DC21040 Tulip adapter at 0x9000.
<BR>
&nbsp;Port selection is 100mbps-SYM/PCS 100baseTx scrambler, half-duplex.
<BR>
&nbsp;Transmit started, Receive started, half-duplex.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rx process state is 'Waiting for packets'.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tx process state is 'Idle'.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The transmit unit is set to store-and-forward.
<BR>
&nbsp;Use '-a' to show device registers,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'-e' to show EEPROM contents,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;or '-m' to show MII management registers.
<BR>
<P>This always seems to be the output whether the two boxes can ping each
<BR>
other or not. Does anyone know if this program actually works?
<BR>
<P>On the i686 tulip-diag reports 
<BR>
<P>tulip-diag.c:v1.08 2/28/99 Donald Becker (<A HREF="mailto:becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov?subject=Re:%20Tulip%20on%20XL300">becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov</A>)
<BR>
Index #1: Found a Digital DS21143 Tulip adapter at 0xf400.
<BR>
&nbsp;Port selection is 10mpbs-serial, full-duplex.
<BR>
&nbsp;Transmit started, Receive started, full-duplex.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rx process state is 'Waiting for packets'.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tx process state is 'Idle'.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The transmit threshold is 72. 
<BR>
&nbsp;Use '-a' to show device registers,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'-e' to show EEPROM contents,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;or '-m' to show MII management registers.
<BR>
<P>Which seems fine.
<BR>
<P>And one last thing I have tried the following tulip drivers:
<BR>
v0.89H v0.90 &amp; v90q
<BR>
<P>and for the de4x5:
<BR>
V0.543
<BR>
<P>Does anybody have any idea as to what is going on.
<BR>
<P>regards
<BR>
