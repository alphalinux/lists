<EM>&gt; blank itz a linux native partition.. 
</EM><BR>
<P>The fact that it says &quot;native linux&quot; in fdisk does not mean that it 
<BR>
has a filesystem on it, just that the partition type is set to 
<BR>
&quot;native linux&quot; (82 I think). If you never made a filesystem on it you 
<BR>
will not be able to mount it. If you just did a RH install then you 
<BR>
would have had to check that you wanted a filesystem made on that 
<BR>
partition, also I don't remember if it will even ask if you don't 
<BR>
have the partition as part of the tree already. In other words, if 
<BR>
during the install you didn't pick this partition and say I want it 
<BR>
mounted to /home or where ever then I don't think RH install will 
<BR>
offer to make a filesystem on it.
<BR>
<P>If nothing is on it make a filesystem again anyway, it won't hurt. 
<BR>
The command you want it mkefs if I remember correctly. Use man or --
<BR>
help (-?) and it should tell you what you need.
