<EM>&gt; Jay&gt; On Alpha, in addition to the direct-map DMA windows which are currently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jay&gt; used, one can define what we call &quot;scatter-gather&quot; DMA windows. The range of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jay&gt; PCI addresses that fall into one of these windows are re-directed to host
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jay&gt; memory via a page table, where the address in a PTE can be *any* page in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jay&gt; possible installed memory - no bounce buffers needed... :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I suspect this is what the original poster was referring to.  In any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; case, for 2.3 at least, this would be the best target to shoot for, IMO.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How much effort would be required to implement this scheme?  If the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; `scatter-gather' were set up at device resolution, rather than page
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resolution, would the drivers even require modification?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  It still requires that a driver allocate a section of memory that it
<BR>
is going to be using for PCI communication.  There's no way around this.
<BR>
<P>I (the original poster) don't know if a scatter-gather solution is required
<BR>
(it is supported by alpha hardware, I don't know about others).  It may be
<BR>
possible to do it without scatter-gather support in hardware.  At any rate,
<BR>
it looks like all device drivers that are going to be using PCI transfers
<BR>
will have to do something like:
<BR>
<P>bus_alloc(&lt;buffer address&gt;, &lt;size&gt;);
<BR>
out(virt_to_bus(&lt;buffer address&gt;), HARDWARE_DO_SOMETHING_PORT);
<BR>
[...]
<BR>
bus_dealloc(&lt;buffer address&gt;);
<BR>
<P>virt_to_bus is currently implemented, but cannot on the fly determine how to
<BR>
reallocate mappings so as to not clobber another device, unless it is told
<BR>
(via my bus_alloc or something similar) who is using what regions of the PCI
<BR>
address space.
<BR>
<P>Note that using this bus_alloc/bus_dealloc implementation allows the driver
<BR>
to keep several buffers.  Also note that giving the hardware a different
<BR>
address within the buffer should work fine too.  (out(virt_to_bus(&lt;buffer
<BR>
<EM>address&gt; + 0x4000), HARDWARE_DO_SOMETHING_PORT) etc.)
</EM><BR>
<P>On alpha scatter-gather is simply an address translation scheme that allows
<BR>
small granularity (8kb).  I don't know how much kernel support beyond
<BR>
bus_alloc/virt_to_bus/bus_dealloc would be required to implement bounce
<BR>
buffers using the scatter-gather mappings.  Perhaps someone who understands
<BR>
bounce buffers would care to comment?  (I'm still not sure what they are...)
<BR>
<P>I wonder if it would be possible to take a poll of hardware owners to
<BR>
determine which chipsets support scatter-gather.  I don't know if this is
<BR>
part of the PCI spec, or a hack implemented by Digital and Sun.  Will Merced
<BR>
chipsets support scatter-gather?  At any rate, a generic
<BR>
bus_alloc/bus_dealloc should be able to hide whatever memory-&gt;bus remapping
<BR>
the hardware supports...whether scatter-gather exists on all chipsets or
<BR>
not.
<BR>
<P>Most importantly: if bounce buffers are required to access memory &gt;1GB from
<BR>
PCI, can it be done with a simple bus_alloc/virt_to_bus/bus_dealloc?  Or
<BR>
must we implement a more complex solution that can handle both cases?
