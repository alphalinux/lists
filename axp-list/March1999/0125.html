<EM>&gt; directed to do some reading from teh faq's/howto's and Linux Redhat 5.2

<EM>&gt; DISTRIBUTION documentation?

<EM>&gt;         As I said, I don't mind helping newbies if I can, but I think he

<EM>&gt; would most certainly be better helped by pointing him to self-help

<EM>&gt; materials to allow him to learn some fundamentals...

<P>Everybody likes to have someone try the same thing when they
<BR>
have a problem getting something to work to verify whether they
<BR>
screwed up or the SW screwed up.
<BR>
<P>Good point on what system he's using though. It's hard to tell.
<BR>
Just to be clear. This list is specifically for DEC/Compaq Alpha
<BR>
processor based systems. If you have something other than that,
<BR>
use another list, maybe redhat-list would work.

<EM>&gt; &gt; My midnight commander can't open a file to read , how come?

<EM>&gt; &gt; Kindly help me out if anyone have the solution.

<P>I loaded mc-4.1.3[35]-2.[alpha|intel].rpm from RH5.2 on my
<BR>
Intel and Alpha and it works as expected on either system. So,
<BR>
either RH5.1 has a bad mc*rpm or you need to look at the
<BR>
commands at the bottom of the mc screen. They refer to the
<BR>
function key to press to make the requested function occur.
<BR>
<P>&quot;4Edit&quot; means hit F4.
<BR>
<P>Or, type &quot;man mc&quot; and read what it says.
<BR>
<P>Also, make sure your file permissions give you read authority.
