<P><EM>&gt;Any idea why the new faster CPU (833 MHz) has only 4 MB of cache while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the previous CPU had 8 MB?  It seems that faster CPUs would need more L1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cache in order to be able to keep running faster.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which should have been L2 cache.

<P>And Maurice W. Hilarius replied:

<P><EM>&gt;The memory bus front side bus speed on a UP2K is 83MHz.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;With the 667 it was memory bus speed time 8.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;With the 750  it &quot;featured&quot; a multiplier of 10 times 75MHz. So the memory 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fsb was running at 75MHz, and the larger 8MB cache was needed to keep it at 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;full speed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;With the 833 it is running a 10x multiplier of 83, plus it is DDR cache, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;giving an effective cache access speed that is twice as fast as the older 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;CPU modules.
</EM><BR>
<P>and later Tom Heibel wrote:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;DDR cache is a Double Data Rate cache memory.  In laymans terms, it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a bi-directional memory chip.  This means it can accomplish the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;speed and better latency than a system with twice as much non DDR
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cache.
</EM><BR>
<P>So let me state what I think is what I understand:
<BR>
<P>The DDR cache is a bi-directional memory that can provide twice the
<BR>
data rate as non-DDR cache.  So does this mean it can do both read and
<BR>
write simultaneously?  Does this also mean that the non-DDR cache
<BR>
memories had to split its clock cycles between reads and writes?
