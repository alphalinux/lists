<P><EM>&gt; Just a couple points I've noticed about RH7.0
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; running on Intel. RH appear to be moving toward
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the MS model of SW. First there was kudzu, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I always disable. Second, they've added a daemon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; called rhnsd which appears to be designed to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; automatically retrieve SW updates for you, again,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I immediately disabled it. Third, they've totally 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; screwed up inetd configuration by switching to xinetd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which looks nothing like inetd and in fact is broken.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sad, but true.. I really dislike how they do all this without giving you
<BR>
a choice over the matter. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm sure there are other things I haven't noticed yet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you expect RH to install your devices the way they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see fit and you expect them to update your SW for you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (consider how this could effect a real server) then by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all means install RH7.0.
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly how I see it. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; They've finally crossed the point where I'm actively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looking for another distribution to replace them.
</EM><BR>
<P>I went to Debian from RedHat some years ago and haven't looked back
<BR>
since. One of the final straws, for me at least, was having
<BR>
configuration files overwriten with new &quot;stock&quot; ones. Having your apache
<BR>
(just an example) config replaced with a generic one is completely
<BR>
unacceptable! Plus you don't know what state software is in when you
<BR>
install it (is it known to be stable or unstable). I've OFTEN found
<BR>
Debian's unstable tree to be more stable to any of RH's .0 releases.
<BR>
RH's fix to security problems (as far as I've ever seen) has been to
<BR>
release the latest version of the said software (often a beta version),
<BR>
where with Debian most security fixes are back ported to a known stable
<BR>
version...
