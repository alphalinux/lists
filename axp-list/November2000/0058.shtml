<EM>&gt; Maurice,

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks for the help.  This is an issue we all need to overcome if we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are going to use PCI modems in any Linux box because the motherboards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being produced today have no ISA slots at all.
</EM><BR>
<P>PCI modem is not the same thing as &quot;winmodem&quot; although you have a pretty
<BR>
good chance that a random sample of the first will turn out to be the
<BR>
later.  Real modem cards, even PCI, happen to work on Linux for &quot;always&quot;
<BR>
and likely this includes Alphas although I never tried.  Flipping
<BR>
power on a external modem always beats rebooting a machine because
<BR>
a modem &quot;hanged&quot;.  Modems work in a pretty harsh environment, with
<BR>
all line noise, pretty broad specs and unexpected &quot;signals&quot;, so &quot;hangs&quot;
<BR>
are not that infrequent.  Not mentioning a buggy firmware with is
<BR>
an everyday event.
<BR>
<P>Lightning hits on your phone lines, frying your external modem but
<BR>
not a motherboard, are also something to think about.
<BR>
<P>In general, in my opinion, &quot;winmodem&quot; as a concept sucks badly for
<BR>
various reasons.  There are people which are trying to do something with
<BR>
that stuff (a &quot;smart&quot; telecomunication card, for example, which is not
<BR>
precisely a modem) and you can visit <A HREF="http://linmodems.org/">http://linmodems.org/</A> to see how
<BR>
this goes.  Usually not so great mostly due to a lack of technical specs
<BR>
from manufacturers.  There is no such thing as a &quot;standard&quot; for these
<BR>
and implementations vary widely.
<BR>
<P>For x86 machines there is a binary-only module from Lucent which allows
<BR>
some of these contraptions to work as modems.  It is good only with some
<BR>
kernel versions, pretends to work with some other but it is not
<BR>
reliable, and is a constant source of much aggravation and horror
<BR>
stories.
