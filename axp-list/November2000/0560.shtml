<P>
Ya know..  Normally I wouldn't reply to this clearly off-topic
<BR>
flame-bait post, but I've read too much of this stuff lately and I'm
<BR>
starting to think that some people might actually believe these kind
<BR>
of of things about Red Hat.
<BR>
<P>First and foremost, if Red Hat were a company like MicroSoft, I (as a
<BR>
developer) probably wouldn't even be drafting a response to this.  At
<BR>
Red Hat I'd like to think that we're a member of the Community that
<BR>
makes Free Software/Open Source Software work.
<BR>
<P>First, you can very easily disable kudzu.  Type &quot;chkconfig kudzu off&quot;
<BR>
and you're done.  I'd like to see you disable the hardware
<BR>
auto-detection in Windows...
<BR>
<P>The Red Hat Network Daemon will not automatically do anything to your
<BR>
system at all until you configure it to do something.  You are in
<BR>
complete control over whether or not to use the service.  Updates are
<BR>
still delivered via FTP as they always have, so nothing has changed.
<BR>
<P>As far as inetd v/s xinetd goes... well, I'd have to say that I've
<BR>
heard not as many complaints as I have praises of xinetd.  But with
<BR>
Red Hat Linux you're welcome to modify it to use inetd if you so
<BR>
desire, that's your choice.  It's also your choise to use another
<BR>
distribution if it suits your needs better.  Instead, I'd rather have
<BR>
users submit *detailed* bug reports to bugzilla or participate in
<BR>
development discussion on redhat-devel-list@redhat.com.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,

<EM>&gt; Just a couple points I've noticed about RH7.0

<EM>&gt; running on Intel. RH appear to be moving toward
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the MS model of SW. First there was kudzu, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I always disable. Second, they've added a daemon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; called rhnsd which appears to be designed to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; automatically retrieve SW updates for you, again,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I immediately disabled it. Third, they've totally 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; screwed up inetd configuration by switching to xinetd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which looks nothing like inetd and in fact is broken.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm sure there are other things I haven't noticed yet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you expect RH to install your devices the way they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see fit and you expect them to update your SW for you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (consider how this could effect a real server) then by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all means install RH7.0.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They've finally crossed the point where I'm actively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looking for another distribution to replace them.
