<P>
With regards to your message at 10:49 PM 11/30/00, W Bauske. Where you stated:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Both the UDMA and SCSI Ultra80 and 160 buses are certainly capable of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 40MB/sec transfer rates.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; As for drives:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; A drive can do a sustained throughput limited by the interface between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; heads and media.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; At 5400rpm this is around 15MB/sec. At 7200 this is about 21MB/sec, and at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 10Krpm around 28MB/sec. Finally, at 15Krpm it is at roughly 42MB/sec.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; As NO IDE drives are available that go faster than 7200rpm, the maximum
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sustained throughput for large files or data streams is around 21MB/sec.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You're assuming the linear density on the track stays
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;constant. It probably doesn't. If you increase the bits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;per inch, the speed will increase. One of my 80GB 5400rpm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;drives under 2.4.0test10 on an Athlon box:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;/dev/hdf:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.83 seconds =154.22 MB/sec
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  2.25 seconds = 28.44 MB/sec
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Also read a 10GB file in 367 seconds. That would be 29257270
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bytes/sec. on average on a 5400rpm drive. The hdparm rate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is 29821501 bytes/sec. Test file:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Write performance under 2.4.0test10 is relatively horrible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;compared to a 2.2.xx kernel. Don't know what they have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;messed up. It's about half what the read speed is above.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There are some really nice fixes in the 2.4.0testxx series.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I can mount an 80GB file system in under a second. On the 2.2.xx
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;series, it could take 30 seconds or so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

Density is key to some of this, but, for example, the highest density 7200 
<BR>
IDE drives are the Seagate Barracuda ATAIII and Maxtor DiamondMax Plus 60.
<BR>
Both have 3 platters, each holding 10GB a side.
<BR>
Here is some recent testing of these using HDTach.
<BR>
As you can see they can pull 30MB/sec in reads, but only 20MB/sec in writes.
<BR>
Again buffering is the biggest difference between the two rates.
<BR>
Think of it this way:
<BR>
How can the rates be different?
<BR>
Same platter, same rotation speed, same density, same heads, same bus, same 
<BR>
everything. It's not like the drive is  slowing down it's spin rate for writes!
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.gamersdepot.com/hardware/storage/maxtor/dmaxplus_60/004.htm">http://www.gamersdepot.com/hardware/storage/maxtor/dmaxplus_60/004.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>Especially interesting to see as the write proceeds to fill the disks, the 
<BR>
rate drops from about 23MB/sec to under 20MB/sec.
<BR>
This is because it is going from the longer outer tracks to the shorter 
<BR>
inner ones.
<BR>
Same spin rate means less media is passing the heads.
<BR>
<P>As for price these are $299 USD SRP drives. 60GB, 7200rpm, 2MB cache.
<BR>
That's $4.98/GB
<BR>
<P>The fastest UltraSCSI160 is the Seagate Cheetah 15X 18.2GB unit, which 
<BR>
costs around $490 USD
<BR>
That's $26.90/GB
<BR>
<P>So, IDE is definitely cheaper!
<BR>
<P>Of course the U160 Cheetah has 8 times as much cache, 2 more years of 
<BR>
warranty, and a MTBF that is 1/3 of the IDE Maxtor..
<BR>
And, it is literally 2.3 times as fast.
<BR>
