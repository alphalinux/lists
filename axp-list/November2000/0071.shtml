<P>
Here's somewhat of a different tack on this issue. (And more than &quot;enough
<BR>
blue sky to patch a dutchman's pants.&quot;)
<BR>
<P>Personally, I'm of the opinion that somewhere in the 2005-2007 time frame,
<BR>
if not before, we are likely to see the end of what we all call the
<BR>
mid-range computer today. By then the market will have become much
<BR>
polarized, maybe even completely -- into lots of &quot;smart&quot; things, which you
<BR>
can't do much with beyond their &quot;programmed by the manufacturer&quot; abilities;
<BR>
and really big boxes to run them.
<BR>
<P>What we all call a &quot;Personal Computer&quot; today, will be replaced by a real
<BR>
&quot;Home Computer&quot; -- that is one that runs like a refrigerator and truly is a
<BR>
general purpose home server. However, I would assume it to be several times
<BR>
more powerful than something like an ES40 today, and it will be in the
<BR>
$2-5000 price range. Retrofitting older houses will be expensive, but that
<BR>
will just be rolled into the cost of new housing. Access to this box will
<BR>
be via an assortment of Blue-Tooth and other wireless &quot;smart things.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>In the commercial market we'll see much the same thing happening.
<BR>
Larry Ellison's Network Computers were ahead of their time but that will be
<BR>
everybody's desktop and they will be running on 100meg (minimum) LANs
<BR>
connected to massive ASP (application Service Provider) systems.
<BR>
(This trend is often called &quot;sever consolidation,&quot; and Oracle has actually
<BR>
bet the farm on it.)
<BR>
<P>What I'm expecting is that there will be really rinky-dink machines on the
<BR>
low end and really incredible Wildfire/Sierra class machines on the top...
<BR>
The high end will be provided by Alpha and Power and the low end by AMD and
<BR>
maybe Alpha and PowerPC -- but they're all going to look an awful lot
<BR>
alike, and not much like the x86 world we know today.
<BR>
<P>There will be so much difference in computing coming in the next few years
<BR>
that we'll look back on today just as today we look back on the PDPs that
<BR>
gave birth to Unix... difficult to believe that they were THAT slow and
<BR>
had only 4K of memory. (Yes, K, not meg.)
<BR>
<P>Intel, Sparc and Parc will be history. None of those architectures have a
<BR>
long term future. And they barely have a short-term one.
<BR>
<P>Forbes (current issue) just did another piece on the fact that Sun is still
<BR>
(a year later) having trouble keeping their high end Enterprise Servers 
<BR>
running. They're now claiming that it's cosmic rays effecting the cache
<BR>
chips! It is undoubedly true, but it's an incredible, &quot;oops.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&quot;Windows&quot; on the desktop is good for another 3-5 years, maybe. Gates knows
<BR>
this, that why his push into the data-center and into the &quot;set-top&quot; world,
<BR>
with the X-box.
<BR>
<P>Windows/Palm/or Linux for the &quot;hand-held&quot; stuff? Hmmm... one wonders if the
<BR>
low end is in fact going to belong to Transmeta instead of AMD. We won't
<BR>
know for a couple of years yet. [At 40watts it certainly won't be an IA64.]
<BR>
<P>But, despite all this, I'm stil pushing the Compaq folks to drive up Alpha
<BR>
volumes by moving back to the desktop. Support for &quot;real&quot; graphics boards
<BR>
and other consumer oriented things, like USB and Firewire, are essential,
<BR>
along with applications.
<BR>
<P>But alas and alack, Alpha's problem is still Stealth Marketing. Many of us
<BR>
hoped that Alpha and Tru64 would benefit from Compaq's marketing know-how,
<BR>
but it seems that only the only people within Compaq who know what the
<BR>
word marketing means, sell &quot;Industry Standard Servers (x86)&quot; or VMS.
<BR>
Aha... but maybe that's Alpha's saviour -- VMS. VMS is now free to
<BR>
educational sites. And VMS has a history of desktop support and clusters!
<BR>
And they are the ones that taught SUN how to &quot;market&quot; into Education.
<BR>
-- Give'em away so people grow-up on 'em, then they'll buy them when they
<BR>
start their own businesses -- sad, but Palmer forgot that in trying to
<BR>
&quot;upscale&quot; things.
<BR>
<P>IBM's new Power series will give Alpha a run for the High-end, but
<BR>
fortunately, Alpha and Power share a lot of similar ideas as well as
<BR>
Fabrication technologies.
<BR>
<P>Alpha and Tru64 volumes ARE going up, that means that prices should start
<BR>
coming down. Hopefully soon.
<BR>
<P>Now, if I could only convince Compaq folks that lowering prices increases 
<BR>
demand.
<BR>
<P>There's a Unix knowledge contest starting next week -- check out the Tru64
<BR>
home page (www.tru64unix.compaq.com), there are some nice prizes. Maybe,
<BR>
this marks the beginning of some serious Alpha marketing.
<BR>
<P>Alpha has a future. IA64 blew it. And Bill Joy claims that he's terrified
<BR>
of &quot;nano-technology.&quot; I contend that's because he knows that Sun has no
<BR>
place in that world.
<BR>
<P>Now if we could just find some applications...
<BR>
<P>In 2006 it will be an interesting exercise to see how much I underestimated
<BR>
the changes.
<BR>
<P><P>Enough rampant speculation, it's obviously been a long day...comments?
