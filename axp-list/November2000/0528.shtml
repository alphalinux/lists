<EM>&gt; Check their updates page for info. What comes on the CD you buy is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; broken. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok.  I didn't buy a CD.  I just grabbed the src.rpm from a local ftp site and 
<BR>
compiled it.
<BR>
<P>&lt;Warning &quot;rambling mode on&quot; &quot;and it's getting late here&quot;&gt;
<BR>
<P>I'm under the impression that when you install a new release, you get what you 
<BR>
asked for (or deserve, depending how you see it).
<BR>
<P>Usually, you have spent quite some time setting up your systems, and you know 
<BR>
their quirks, and how they run.  Just installing a new release is like opening 
<BR>
a whole new can of worms.  I try to avoid it.
<BR>
<P>All my systems still display &quot;RedHat release 5.2&quot; (or even 5.0), but have 
<BR>
evolved over time, when there was some need.  They now tend to run a 2.4.0 
<BR>
kernel, with glibc 2.2, for example.
<BR>
<P>I think you are better off, in the long run, to reuse your current setup, and 
<BR>
update the necessary pieces.  This way, it won't be such a black box.
<BR>
<P>Setting up a new system is not a problem either: just boot it using some CD
<BR>
that came with one of those colorful Linux magazine, and do a minimal install
<BR>
in a small partition that will become the swap partition of the new system.
<BR>
Then boot this minimal setup, copy &quot;your&quot; current setup from another of your 
<BR>
machines, edit some /etc files, and you are all set, with no nasty surprises.
<BR>
<P>I guess I'm a bit old-fashioned, but that's the way I like it.  Needless to 
<BR>
say, I tend to want to compile all my stuff from source (and tweak the SRPMS 
<BR>
too, of course :)
<BR>
<P>&lt;/Warning &quot;rambling mode on&quot; &quot;and it's getting late here&quot;&gt;
<BR>
<P>Ah well, sorry for the rambling.  Time to go to sleep, I guess...
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
