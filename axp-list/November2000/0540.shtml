<P><EM>&gt; Seems you have a situation different from mine. inetd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is never heavily loaded on my systems. Any daemons that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do lots of work run independently and are not started
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by inetd. I would hope your POP3 and FTP daemons are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; able to run stand alone as many daemons can, to support
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heavy loads and bypass any intermediate SW like inetd.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I mean, what inetd does is pretty simple. It listens
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on sockets and when it gets a request, forks the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appropriate server to handle it. Not rocket science here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It should not fall down. The only thing I can think of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that it might get wrong is setting the backlog levels on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the sockets it listens to. Then you'd get dropped connections
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; under heavy load. Then again, inetd does support users
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; setting their own length backlog.(-q length) I'd be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; curious exactly what you mean by &quot;take a dump&quot;. If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; got connection errors, you just mis-configured inetd.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's simply a memory usage issue.  The problem was that a program called
<BR>
&quot;webtrends&quot; would automatically upload web pages.  To do this it would
<BR>
start several FTP sessions, very quickly.  This was the primary usage for
<BR>
FTP on that machine. Inetd would start to use more and more memory.  It
<BR>
would then stop responding and ALMOST lock up the machine. After about
<BR>
five minutes it would wake up again.  This same problem also happened with
<BR>
POP3 servers.
<BR>
<P>Same programs under TCP server, no problem, I could actually run SEVERAL
<BR>
web trends reports concurrently.  I mean 1/2 gig of memory on an Ultra 2
<BR>
should NOT be overwhelmed by a P266 running a damn web trend report!
<BR>
(haven't found a POP3 daemon that is too secure to be honest, I still run
<BR>
QMAIL's pop3daemo through TCP server.  I have switched to PRO ftp in
<BR>
Daemon mode and that causes no problems either)
<BR>
<P>As you said, Inetd is a SIMPLE program, what it does is not hard or
<BR>
complicated.  That is why it's performance was simply un-acceptable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; True, but some of us need newer distributions to support
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what we do. Consider how you'd support large files (2GB+) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and 100's of GB of disk on both Alpha and x86. I deal with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TB's of data on both platforms regularly.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then I'd have to say that NO distrobution is going to be good for you.
<BR>
&quot;rolling your own&quot; seems to be the ideal solutions.  After all the things
<BR>
that you require are specific to your site.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Lots of people don't care about those sorts of things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though so they can live with down level distributions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even RH7.0 is not capable of cleanly running a 2.4.testxx
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kernel. Modules are fun, they like to play hide n' seek.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I sympthize with you there.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; They hit my limit on what I consider problems. More a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; straw that broke the camel's back than any single thing.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's too bad.  I can relate, my frustration level at certain points have
<BR>
been pretty high.  The 6.0 release comes to mind as causing my blood
<BR>
pressure to go up.  Only installed it on the test machine, never ever went
<BR>
into produciton (Only 4.2, 5.2 and 6.2 distro have made it into
<BR>
production)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I mention the issues that concern me here because RH
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people occasionally reply on this list and maybe they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; listen too.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps we on the list could suggest things that we are looking for in an
<BR>
install?  
<BR>
<P>After talking to some RH people at length I understand why the released
<BR>
7.0 RH has always had lots of releases, and the .0's tend to be &quot;bleeding
<BR>
edge&quot;.  Groups like debian release things MUCH more slowly.  Packages and
<BR>
updates tend to come out more slowly IMHO.  The good thing is that EVERY
<BR>
package imaginable seems to be available! 
<BR>
<P>Again in the end, a &quot;roll you own&quot; approach will probably work best.  For
<BR>
a companies with several installs I make my own CD's to do just that.
