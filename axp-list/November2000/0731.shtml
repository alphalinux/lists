<EM>&gt; With regards to your message at 04:07 PM 11/30/00, Michal Jaegermann. Where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you stated:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt;snippage&gt;&gt;I never said that.  25 MB/sec were numbers I have seen myself from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;modern IDE (ATAPI) drives and with UDMA on.  I would not be surprised
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to clock up to 30 with a higher density media but Paul was talking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;about 40ies.  Yes, I know that the current ATA specs allow for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;100 MB/secs and Linux actually has capabilieties to use that.  Still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;you need drives. :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>OK. Misunderstood which drive you were referring to.
<BR>
Still though, I'm pretty sure I saw in the 30's under
<BR>
2.2.xx kernels.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Quite often a limiting factor is also a controller.  With older boards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and built-in IDE controllers you will not get even close to numbers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;we are talking about.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    Michal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Both the UDMA and SCSI Ultra80 and 160 buses are certainly capable of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 40MB/sec transfer rates.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As for drives:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A drive can do a sustained throughput limited by the interface between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heads and media.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; At 5400rpm this is around 15MB/sec. At 7200 this is about 21MB/sec, and at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 10Krpm around 28MB/sec. Finally, at 15Krpm it is at roughly 42MB/sec.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As NO IDE drives are available that go faster than 7200rpm, the maximum
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sustained throughput for large files or data streams is around 21MB/sec.
</EM><BR>
<P>You're assuming the linear density on the track stays 
<BR>
constant. It probably doesn't. If you increase the bits 
<BR>
per inch, the speed will increase. One of my 80GB 5400rpm 
<BR>
drives under 2.4.0test10 on an Athlon box:
<BR>
<P>/dev/hdf:
<BR>
&nbsp;Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.83 seconds =154.22 MB/sec
<BR>
&nbsp;Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  2.25 seconds = 28.44 MB/sec
<BR>
<P>Also read a 10GB file in 367 seconds. That would be 29257270
<BR>
bytes/sec. on average on a 5400rpm drive. The hdparm rate
<BR>
is 29821501 bytes/sec. Test file:
<BR>
<P>-rw-r--r--    1 root     root     10737418240 Nov 30 22:18 junk1
<BR>
<P>Keep in mind this is a $270 drive.
<BR>
<P>I think this is slower than I saw under the 2.2.15prexx kernel 
<BR>
I used to run. If I get time this weekend, I'll reboot back to 
<BR>
it and make sure I wasn't hallucinating.
<BR>
<P>Write performance under 2.4.0test10 is relatively horrible
<BR>
compared to a 2.2.xx kernel. Don't know what they have
<BR>
messed up. It's about half what the read speed is above.
<BR>
There are some really nice fixes in the 2.4.0testxx series.
<BR>
I can mount an 80GB file system in under a second. On the 2.2.xx
<BR>
series, it could take 30 seconds or so.
