<EM>&gt; If you log into the machine and run free you will get an amount of used
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and free ram.  Compare this to the amount you get after running X and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then exiting and you get a different number.  Now log out and in and you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get yet a different number.  All lower than the one you started with. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now is this a good example of a memory leak or am I thinking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incorrectly.  Shouldn't you have the same amount of ram before and after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; running a task and then exiting?
</EM><BR>
<P>Not really.  In almost every case, some/most of the memory that was used
<BR>
by the applications will remain &quot;used&quot; as cache or shared mem (look at the
<BR>
right columns in free's output).  It will be reclaimed and reallocated as
<BR>
needed, though, by the VM.  To be honest, 128MB RAM is not a lot in a RISC
<BR>
machine, but it should be adequate for most tasks (I've been running with
<BR>
the same amount of RAM for years now).  He may hit swap every so often,
<BR>
though, especially when trying to run Netscape plus a few other X apps
<BR>
simultaneously.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; His concern is that when he runs xinit and then netscape, his machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; locks up hard.  It seems to be a memory problem as he can't telnet in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and he can't move his mouse (which is usually hardware).  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you have any idea about what I am saying and possibly a way of fixing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or explaining why this happens, could you let me know.  I'd appreciate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any help I can get.  Thanks
</EM><BR>
<P>What kernel is he running?  It sounds like either the VM is falling over
<BR>
(not surprising), he's got a problem when exceeding physical RAM (problem
<BR>
with swap...or the VM again), or he's got some defective RAM (doubtful
<BR>
since there would be some other warning signs).  If it's either of the
<BR>
first two, though, it is probably kernel related, hence the question...
