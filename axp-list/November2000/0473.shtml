<P>This has happened with my UP1000 from time to time,
<BR>
when I have experimented with different kernels.
<BR>
My general suspicions and impressions are that
<BR>
<P>1.  The 2.2.14 and 2.2.16 Alpha kernels from RedHat
<BR>
both have problems or lack features.
<BR>
<P>2.  The 2.2.16 Alpha kernel from the RedHat updates
<BR>
directory fares better than 2.2.14, but it lacks ide dma,
<BR>
a must.
<BR>
<P>3.  The best Kernels for UP1000 are those you roll
<BR>
yourself.   Obtain a stock 2.2.16 or 2.2.17 kernel
<BR>
from ftp.kernel.org:/pub/linux/kernel/2.2.
<BR>
Obtain patches from ftp.alphalinux.org/pub/people.
<BR>
The patch for ide dma, really a must, is in hedrick/ there.
<BR>
The patch for software raid, not so important, is in ...
<BR>
arg!  I can't recall at the moment.
<BR>
<P>4.  There may be other patches here that you might
<BR>
want to apply, but there appears to be now documentation
<BR>
anywhere about these options and the ramifications
<BR>
of applying or not applying them.  It seems that the
<BR>
only way to find out is to query this list.
<BR>
(Someone correct me if I'm wrong here.)
<BR>
<P>5.  Gnome in RH 6.1 and maybe 6.2 can cause problems
<BR>
with some alpha systems.  It's forced me to used kde
<BR>
exclusively, at least for now.
