<EM>&gt; probably in our 'mpich-1.2.0' package but until that is resolved

<EM>&gt; we need to turn of the printing since particularly on our Red Hat

<P>Find attached to the end a posting by Michal last May that includes a
<BR>
potentially useful code snippet (after modification) for controlling
<BR>
the printing of those messages, along with some reasonable explication
<BR>
re: cause/cure of unaligned accesses.
<BR>
<P>Sure, you can make the *messages* go away, but your program's
<BR>
performance is going to continue to be terrible, as the traps into the
<BR>
kernel to handle the unaligned access will still be happening.
<BR>
<P>Take Matt's suggestion and go for the fix as well.
<BR>
<P>Good luck.

<P>David Huggins-Daines posted a very informative archive on the &quot;unaligned
<BR>
trap&quot; problem which explains what it is in a much greater detail than
<BR>
FAQ entry on www.alphalinux.org. :-)
<BR>
<P>I still have some commments.  First, it looks like that one again it is
<BR>
a time for a &quot;periodic posting&quot; (it was posted on this list in the past
<BR>
more than once) of a program which is of a great help if one is hunting
<BR>
for troublesome spots.  An advantage of it is that you will get a bomb
<BR>
instead of a trap and a message so you can catch its location in a
<BR>
debugger like gdb.  Here it goes:

</EM><BR>
<P><P>A C compiler, by its definition, is free to allocate a structure with
<BR>
&quot;holes&quot; so sizeof(struct foo) __may__ turn out to be, say, 24 even if
<BR>
sum of sizes of this structure elements are 12.  In this particular case
<BR>
you can, probably, assume that a compiler is relatively &quot;sane&quot; and that
<BR>
sizeof(struct foo) is indeed 12 even without checking but I have seen
<BR>
problems caused by similar, if not so blatant, assumptions.  The problem
<BR>
is compounded by the fact that C does not really provide a good portable
<BR>
way out of this bind (save, possibly, of making this into an array of
<BR>
bytes).  gcc has for such occasions , mentioned by David, '__attribute__
<BR>
((packed))' construct but this is a compiler specific extension.
<BR>
<P>If you peek inside Linux kernel headers (NOT glibc headers) then
<BR>
you will find multiple instances where '__attribute__ ((packed))'
<BR>
was used as a layout of many structures has to be tightly controlled.
<BR>
<P>A code generated by gcc to access structure elements may not be the
<BR>
same in an absence or presence of '__attribute__ ((packed))' - even
<BR>
if a structure layout in memory happens to be identical.  In the later
<BR>
case you will not see &quot;unaligned access&quot; messages - if your code
<BR>
was otherwise correct. :-)  If a code is meant to be used with
<BR>
some other compiler you may use a preprocessor to hide conditionally
<BR>
such bits (define a macro which expands to __attribute__ ((packed))
<BR>
or to nothing - depending on a compiler used) but what other compiler
<BR>
will do with your structures and a code cannot be predicted in advance.
<BR>
<P>Last, but not least, I encountered cases when &quot;unaligned accesses&quot;
<BR>
were side-effects of real bugs.  For example, trying to store
<BR>
long in a space which was allocated for int, or an attempt to
<BR>
access a wrong location on a stack, __may__ end up with an
<BR>
unaligned trap.  OTOH it may not, so do not take that for a reliable
<BR>
indicator, but problems of that sort are worth of an investigation
<BR>
not only for a performance reasons.
