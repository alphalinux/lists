<EM>&gt; &gt; Spec wise, the DS20E should be faster.

<P>Just for grins, if you like STREAM so much, run two simultaneous
<BR>
tests on a DS20E and a UP2K and see what the aggregate bandwidth
<BR>
is. I would suspect with a switched architecture, a CPU talks to one 
<BR>
bank at a time. So, unless you run a problem that forces use of all 
<BR>
memory banks, it probably makes no difference compared to a UP2K. 
<BR>
Once you cross that line, I suspect you'll see a difference. Pick 
<BR>
the STREAM total data size to be, say 45% of your memory so with 
<BR>
two active, you use 90% of real memory. Note STREAM uses something 
<BR>
like 3 arrays so one array needs to be 15% of memory.
<BR>
<P>That should give the memory systems a good workout. Make sure you 
<BR>
populate all memory banks on both systems to keep it consistent. 
<BR>
If that doesn't show the difference, then it probably means the 
<BR>
cross bar switch is falling down on the job or there is an OS problem.
<BR>
<P>In the end, the only truly good way to measure a system is with your 
<BR>
own codes and with your configuration. At least then you see what the 
<BR>
system does with your environment.
