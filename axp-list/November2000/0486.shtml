<EM>&gt; UP1000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 128MB Ram
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 20GB IDE Drive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RH 6.2 Stock, no updates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I reloaded the machine myself just to make sure, but it still does it. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you log into the machine and run free you will get an amount of used
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and free ram.  Compare this to the amount you get after running X and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then exiting and you get a different number.  Now log out and in and you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get yet a different number.  All lower than the one you started with. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now is this a good example of a memory leak or am I thinking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incorrectly.  Shouldn't you have the same amount of ram before and after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; running a task and then exiting?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, think of disk caching. Also, If I rememebr correctly, 6.2 has kernel
<BR>
2.2.14-?, that's rather old...I would at least put the 2.2.16-3 update on
<BR>
there. There's also a glibc update, but I think that was security related?
<BR>

<EM>&gt; His concern is that when he runs xinit and then netscape, his machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; locks up hard.  It seems to be a memory problem as he can't telnet in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and he can't move his mouse (which is usually hardware).  
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I wouldn't say that is immediatly hardware, especially if it is always
<BR>
triggered by X+Netscape. How long does the machine run w/o X+Netscape?
