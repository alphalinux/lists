<EM>&gt; &gt; Sure some config files are overwritten,

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Key word: SOMETIMES.  I've run into situations on RH servers that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inherited where config files where just overwritten without notice and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without a backup.

<P>That has never happened to me, as far as I can remember.
<BR>
(Maybe it did and it wasn't a big deal at the time.)
<BR>
I update Red Hat systems frequently, both intel and alpha.
<BR>
I have had problems with updates, particularly
<BR>
recently upon going to 7.0 on some intel systems, where
<BR>
I didn't look to see if the video card was supported.
<BR>
That was my fault.   I think updating RH
<BR>
is easier than updating Tru64 Unix, and certainly easier
<BR>
than updating or installing Windows.   The rpm system
<BR>
has always been a good idea, in my opinion, even though its implementation
<BR>
has had growing pains.
<BR>
<P>I have nothing against Debian.   I think it is not good
<BR>
to pit one Linux/Unix against another.    Remember,
<BR>
the true center of selfishness is in Redmond, WA.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; The upside of this is that you must pay attention
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to these changes right away.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Again, SOMETIMES.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again,  I've not had problems in this way.
<BR>
There are problems...but we live with them
<BR>
because they are not as bad as the popular alternative.
