<EM>&gt; With regards to your message at 11:52 AM 11/24/00, James Fowler. Where you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stated:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Compaq was showing RH7.0 at COMDEX on a DS10.  RH also said, when I asked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;them for an Alpha CD, that RH7.0 was finished and all set to be released.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I don't know what the delay continues to be.  Both COMPAQ and RH said the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;same thing when I asked them about getting a copy/iso of RH7.0 for Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If they aren't telling the truth at tleast they got their story straight.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;;-)  I think that it should be publically released any day.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;James
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, if it is any help, they haven't sent us a new beta copy in about a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; month now..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Just a couple points I've noticed about RH7.0
<BR>
running on Intel. RH appear to be moving toward
<BR>
the MS model of SW. First there was kudzu, which
<BR>
I always disable. Second, they've added a daemon
<BR>
called rhnsd which appears to be designed to 
<BR>
automatically retrieve SW updates for you, again,
<BR>
I immediately disabled it. Third, they've totally 
<BR>
screwed up inetd configuration by switching to xinetd
<BR>
which looks nothing like inetd and in fact is broken.
<BR>
<P>I'm sure there are other things I haven't noticed yet.
<BR>
If you expect RH to install your devices the way they
<BR>
see fit and you expect them to update your SW for you
<BR>
(consider how this could effect a real server) then by
<BR>
all means install RH7.0.
<BR>
<P>They've finally crossed the point where I'm actively
<BR>
looking for another distribution to replace them.
