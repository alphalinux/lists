<P>
greetings,
<BR>
<P>first i would like to say sorry for taking your time with this but i've
<BR>
been unable so far for getting a really understanding about this.  If
<BR>
there is any place i could go and read please tell me so (BTW
<BR>
alphalinux.org has not been accesible for days, but seems it is working
<BR>
now)
<BR>
<P>i have been asking compaq for advice on buying two alpha servers for
<BR>
setting the frontend of a webmail system running linux (RH7) + apache +
<BR>
php + horde + imp
<BR>
<P>i would like to have a hardware RAID card, 512MB and 5 ethernet
<BR>
interfaces.
<BR>
<P>the compaq salesman says that a DS10 fits my needs but keeps saying that i
<BR>
can only use a Ultra2 RAID and COMBO Adapters (Video/NIC) or dual/quad
<BR>
ethernet cards because of the lack of support of Linux for Alpha Hardware.
<BR>
<P>is there really a restriction for linux/alpha for not having more than one
<BR>
ethernet card of any type?, DS10 comes with two integrathed cards but they
<BR>
keep telling me that there is no way to install 3 more cards on the
<BR>
remaining 4 PCI/64bit slots, so i need to buy a quad or a combo and dual
<BR>
card.
<BR>
<P>is there any other restriction/problem i could find later?, i can think of
<BR>
many intel based configurations that have at least this kind of
<BR>
configuration, but i was thinking that a 64bit plattform would be a gain
<BR>
not a pain :(
<BR>
<P>thanks in advance for your time
<BR>
<P><P>Carlo
