Hey there,
<BR>
<P>I have a question for you.  I have a customer running RH 6.2 on a
<BR>
UP1000.  He has been concerned with what seems to be a persistent memory
<BR>
leak.  Here is the config:
<BR>
<P>UP1000
<BR>
128MB Ram
<BR>
20GB IDE Drive
<BR>
RH 6.2 Stock, no updates
<BR>
<P>I reloaded the machine myself just to make sure, but it still does it. 
<BR>
If you log into the machine and run free you will get an amount of used
<BR>
and free ram.  Compare this to the amount you get after running X and
<BR>
then exiting and you get a different number.  Now log out and in and you
<BR>
get yet a different number.  All lower than the one you started with. 
<BR>
Now is this a good example of a memory leak or am I thinking
<BR>
incorrectly.  Shouldn't you have the same amount of ram before and after
<BR>
running a task and then exiting?
<BR>
<P>His concern is that when he runs xinit and then netscape, his machine
<BR>
locks up hard.  It seems to be a memory problem as he can't telnet in
<BR>
and he can't move his mouse (which is usually hardware).  
<BR>
<P>If you have any idea about what I am saying and possibly a way of fixing
<BR>
or explaining why this happens, could you let me know.  I'd appreciate
<BR>
any help I can get.  Thanks
<BR>
<P>Kevin
