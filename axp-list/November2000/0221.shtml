<P>A little background:
<BR>
<P>Most Intel-based motherboards (and some of the older Alphas) were
<BR>
built to support only 16 interrupts: the legacy ISA (junk IO) ones,
<BR>
plus any PCI slots present also have their interrupts mapped somewhere
<BR>
into those 16 levels. Some newer Intel-based mobos, and most Alphas,
<BR>
have additional interrupt controller bits beyond 16, that are mapped
<BR>
however the mobo designers wanted.
<BR>
<P>Now, IIRC, the PCI spec says that a &quot;slot&quot; can have one of 4 different
<BR>
interrupts (INTA, INTB, etc), and the PIN register in the card's
<BR>
config space indicates which one is being used. This is NOT
<BR>
programmable, it is set by the card design. Nearly all cards use INTA,
<BR>
but multi-function boards, or cards with PCI-PCI bridges, may actually
<BR>
use more than 1.
<BR>
<P>On most Alphas, the PCI interrupt routing typically passes all 4 of
<BR>
the possible interrupts from a PCI &quot;slot&quot; to the interrupt summary
<BR>
register. So, for a 4-PCI-slot mobo, you get 16 additional interrupts
<BR>
after the 16 legacy ones. So often you see cards in adjacent slots
<BR>
assigned interrupts that are 4 levels apart (but it really depends
<BR>
on the mapping of slot/INTx pairs to bits in the summary register).
<BR>
<P>With multiple peer PCI buses (as on DS20/ES40/XP1000/UP2000 but not
<BR>
DS10), the number of interrupts grows. In fact, for the WILDFIRE
<BR>
support in the 2.4.x kernels, the maximum number of interrupts has
<BR>
grown to 2048! Yes, that's right, 2K. Largest config has 8 &quot;quads&quot; (4
<BR>
CPUs and up to 8 PCI buses per quad); each pair of PCI buses has 8
<BR>
(2x4) slots (32 interrupts), plus one set of the 16 legacy
<BR>
interrupts. Yes, that's only 48 per bus pair, we kept 16 spares so
<BR>
that a bus pair's interrupts would occupy a single 64-bit summary
<BR>
register (and the interrupts are actually numbered/wired for 0-15 and
<BR>
32-63:-).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Sound cards are infamous for cutting PCI spec corners. Such card which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; got IRQ 37 will think that is really on 5. Oops!  Other devices seems to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be quite a bit better in this respect.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, the cards themselves pay no attention to what's in their IRQ
<BR>
register, that's entirely a software convention (putting the interrupt
<BR>
number in there). SRM console does it so that the Tru64 kernel doesn't
<BR>
have to have all those funky &quot;irq_map&quot; tables that the Linux kernel
<BR>
Alpha support has... ;-}
<BR>
<P>WRT cost-cutting, IIRC, the 1370/1371 sound chips were limited in the
<BR>
addresses that they could DMA from/to; Alpha support typically will
<BR>
provide them with a DMA address above 1GB, which those cards can't
<BR>
handle (not enough bits in their address registers).
