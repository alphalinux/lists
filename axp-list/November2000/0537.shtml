<EM>&gt; &gt; screwed up inetd configuration by switching to xinetd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which looks nothing like inetd and in fact is broken.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inetd itself is such a pice of crap I'm suprised you still use it!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Personally I started using Dan Bernstiens TCPserver a LONG time ago when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SEVERAL boxes couldn't handle various services (POP3 FTP) under heavy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; load.  Indetd would take a dump.  (x86 linux, alpha linux, Solaris 2.4,2.5
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all had the same problem) Never played with xinetd, but almost ANYTHING is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an improvement over inetd with a seriously LOADED server.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Seems you have a situation different from mine. inetd
<BR>
is never heavily loaded on my systems. Any daemons that
<BR>
do lots of work run independently and are not started
<BR>
by inetd. I would hope your POP3 and FTP daemons are
<BR>
able to run stand alone as many daemons can, to support
<BR>
heavy loads and bypass any intermediate SW like inetd.
<BR>
I mean, what inetd does is pretty simple. It listens
<BR>
on sockets and when it gets a request, forks the 
<BR>
appropriate server to handle it. Not rocket science here.
<BR>
It should not fall down. The only thing I can think of
<BR>
that it might get wrong is setting the backlog levels on
<BR>
the sockets it listens to. Then you'd get dropped connections
<BR>
under heavy load. Then again, inetd does support users
<BR>
setting their own length backlog.(-q length) I'd be
<BR>
curious exactly what you mean by &quot;take a dump&quot;. If you
<BR>
got connection errors, you just mis-configured inetd.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think in the end for advanced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; users no distro is perfect.  For me I read the lists, and use the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;stable&quot; version if RH.  I do a text install, choose my packages.  Install
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things from source that I want, ssh, pro-ftp (WU-ftp bleach) and go from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there.  Generally a painless procedure once I compile a kernel for that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machine I'm done.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>True, but some of us need newer distributions to support
<BR>
what we do. Consider how you'd support large files (2GB+) 
<BR>
and 100's of GB of disk on both Alpha and x86. I deal with 
<BR>
TB's of data on both platforms regularly.
<BR>
<P>Lots of people don't care about those sorts of things
<BR>
though so they can live with down level distributions.
<BR>
Even RH7.0 is not capable of cleanly running a 2.4.testxx
<BR>
kernel. Modules are fun, they like to play hide n' seek.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RH as a company is doing a LOT to promote Linux, and I've never had a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;show stopper&quot; from them.  So I continue to &quot;remain faithful&quot;.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>They hit my limit on what I consider problems. More a
<BR>
straw that broke the camel's back than any single thing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have always been happy with RH Each users mileage varies.  I'm not going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to stop using a distro because they are trying to make things easier for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the un-initiated.  As long as I can remove or disable the things I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like (or not install them) I'm happy.  Perhaps, maybe someday RH will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; change their INSTALL procedure.  All we have to do is ask?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I mention the issues that concern me here because RH
<BR>
people occasionally reply on this list and maybe they
<BR>
listen too.
