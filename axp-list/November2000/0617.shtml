<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; And rpm -bb looks right to me, what if you rpm --rebuild *.src.rpm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The same thing -- it gives me usage info.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You forgot to install 'rpm-build' package.
</EM><BR>
<P>I didn't forget.  I didn't know I was supposed to.  I installed
<BR>
rpm-4.0.6x.alpha.rpm from www.rpm.org.  I figured that was what
<BR>
I needed.  I saw some references to other packages, which someone
<BR>
said were required, but since there were so many of them, with odd
<BR>
names, I figured they were for developers or something.
<BR>
<P>I never saw instructions for upgrading to RPM v4.  www.rpm.org
<BR>
certainly doesn't have them.  Does anyone know where they are?
<BR>
<P>When I installed the one rpm, and got no failed dependencies, I
<BR>
figured I had all I needed.
