<EM>&gt; Interesting.  I hadn't known that.  It didn't actually fail with

<EM>&gt; the ALI bridge, I just assumed it was a mistake.  Can anyone with

<EM>&gt; docs on non-DEC bridges confirm that this is a common thing?
</EM><BR>
<P>It would be better if someone who has &quot;PCI-to-PCI Bridge Architecture
<BR>
Specification&quot; handy could confirm this. Non-conforming hardware
<BR>
must live in quirks/fixups etc. ;-)
<BR>
<P>I've found some interesting info today - application note on programming
<BR>
the DEC 21052 bridge (ruffian has this chip, btw):
<BR>
<A HREF="http://download.sourceforge.net/mirrors/NetBSD/misc/dec-docs/ec-qlzba-te.ps.gz">http://download.sourceforge.net/mirrors/NetBSD/misc/dec-docs/ec-qlzba-te.ps.gz</A>
<BR>
<P>Particularly, there are examples for setting up that bridge for IO or MEM
<BR>
only configurations. For example, with IO disabled:
<BR>
1. Set IO base = 0xffff, limit = 0
<BR>
2. Set command register = PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY | PCI_COMMAND_MASTER
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Certainly the fact should be commented if the old code goes back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in to avoid disruption by helpful folks like myself.  :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>That change wasn't bad at all - at least it's 100% safe :-)
<BR>
But of course, it would be better to have unused regions disabled
<BR>
in a clean way.
<BR>
<P>But actually I'm concerned that all this code doesn't work at all -
<BR>
see reports from Michal Jaegermann (the bridge acts as if it drops
<BR>
config space transactions randomly). I have a lot of suggestions, but
<BR>
it's a pain to debug something without access to real hardware - just
<BR>
a waste of the precious time of everyone who is involved...
<BR>
So I would probably wait a week or two until I'll have something with
<BR>
bridges:-(
<BR>
<P>Ivan.
