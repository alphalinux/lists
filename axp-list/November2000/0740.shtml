<EM>&gt; I think I'm hitting this problem with egcs-2.91.66.

<EM>&gt; I'm porting Ingres to run on Alpha Linux and twice now, at different parts in the code I've had a

<EM>&gt; SEGV similar to the one below which as been resolved by compiling with -O0. Not ideal for a

<EM>&gt; database.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Has there been any further development with this issue?

<P>In my experience, similar problems may occur with all compilers 
<BR>
as soon as the code gets too complicated (holds true for any DBMS) - 
<BR>
I have similar effects (&quot;core dumps and/or execution taking wrong paths) 
<BR>
on Tru64 (with Compaq's compiler) and on AIX (with IBM's). 
<BR>
<P>All you can do is keep track of the options you use in building 
<BR>
and the results of your tests, and maybe have a separate &quot;noopt&quot; 
<BR>
build version in parallel to do regression tests. 
<BR>
<P>My most disturbing experience was that in one case on Tru64, 
<BR>
a module that worked fine with &quot;-O1&quot; suddenly misbehaved 
<BR>
when it got trace output (in &quot;#ifdef&quot; sections) activated, and 
<BR>
I had to switch to &quot;-O0&quot; (&quot;minus oh zero&quot;) for the trace case. 
<BR>
<P>So upgrading the compiler might help, but even the most rigorous 
<BR>
testing with one compiler (machine, OS version, compiler version) 
<BR>
will not guarantee it still works after one of these variables 
<BR>
(or some other ...) was changed.
