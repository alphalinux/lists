<P>
I only have experience with 6.4. The only bug that's held me
<BR>
back is that Utah-GLX doesn't work in direct rendering mode, but 
<BR>
that's to be expected since it's not supported on Alpha anyway.
<BR>
<P>A big plus with SuSE is that it runs on older Alpha's (ie. Multia
<BR>
and Jensen). RH 7.0 doesn't support older Alpha's, as far as I know.
<BR>
At least the beta versions of 7.0 didn't. Maybe that has been fixed
<BR>
for the production release.
<BR>
<P>As you say, it's personal taste and depends entirely on what you use
<BR>
your machines for. I can only offer my informed opinion, having run
<BR>
RH, Debian, SuSE, and Blade Alpha boxes since 1995.

<P><P><P><EM>&gt; Better yet, try SuSE. It's rock solid on Alpha. I've had a cluster of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha boxes running without a hitch for months now (6.4). It's a very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stable distro.
</EM><BR>
<P>Apparently the best distro depends on the release and the specific
<BR>
setting, and also on personal taste.
<BR>
<P>I for instance had mixed experiences with SuSE 6.1 and 6.3:
<BR>
- 6.1 had no working bootp or dhcp. The programs in the distribution
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;dumped core. Similar situation with some other daemon, forgot which.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe this was the reason that there was a voucher in 6.1
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for a free 6.3 package.
<BR>
- I was not able to boot the Alpha according to the confusing and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;incomplete description in the SuSE documents, which apparently were
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;written for a different type of machine and bios.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I finally succeeded with the Redhat instructions and some document
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mentioned therein.
<BR>
When it finally ran, I had no more problems.
<BR>
And also no problems with SuSE on x86.
