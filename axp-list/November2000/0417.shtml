<P>
Thanks for the quick response.  It's a shame Veritas doesn't include the
<BR>
source for the RH x86 client, since it &quot;should&quot; compile OK on AXP just as
<BR>
well (it's essentially doing a network copy)....
<BR>
<P>I have my Alpha, a Multia VX40, dedicated for mail only.  It, along with
<BR>
my Pentium Multias, are all crammed into a small spot (I'm in a small
<BR>
apartment), and I don't have any external SCSI stuff to mess with.  The
<BR>
SCSI tape drive is internal and physically in my NT Server.  I also own
<BR>
BackupExec for NT.
<BR>
<P>This is getting crazy....
<BR>
<P>Maybe I can do something like this for backup:
<BR>
1. create cron job (run as root?) to run a shell script
<BR>
2. shell script to tar/gzip everything to a FTP site or HTTP site
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(no SAMBA or NFS stuph is installed on the Multia)
<BR>
3. NT BackupExec gets the .tar.gz to tape
<BR>
I really have no idea how to get .2. running.  Does anyone have any
<BR>
thoughts?  I've never tar'd anything over the network...
<BR>
<P>Maybe I can do something like this for restore:
<BR>
1. Pick out the files thru the NT BackupExec GUI
<BR>
2. Restore the files to a FTP site
<BR>
3. Let the AXP box grab the files and replace them
<BR>
I am afraid that the typing on the Linux files will get clobbered when
<BR>
they are sitting on an NT box before they get to the Multia.  Any thoughts
<BR>
on that issue?
<BR>
<P><P>Thanks!
