<P>If you will look into your Documentation/Changes file in
<BR>
kernel sources (always a good idea, especially if you plan to hack
<BR>
with development kernels) you will find there a section with
<BR>
a title &quot;Current Minimal Requirements&quot;.  A version of modutils
<BR>
was raised there fairly recently - quite a bit later then RH
<BR>
distribution CDs were sent to manufacturing.  The lead time on
<BR>
such things will always lag behind a pace of a kernel development
<BR>
so this is hardly &quot;broken&quot;.
<BR>
<P>OTOH relatively recently a serious security hole was found in modutils
<BR>
and Red Hat issued a security update which covers all 6.x and 7
<BR>
releases.  Depending on what you are running on 5.x system you may be
<BR>
affected by that as well (not if you were not adding stuff on your own)
<BR>
but then you want to recompile modutils from sources configuring with
<BR>
2.0 compatibility and possibly other options.  As a side-effect this
<BR>
security update solves also your problems with modules in the latest 2.4
<BR>
kernels but this was not a primary reason for it.
