<EM>&gt; Ok.  I didn't buy a CD.  I just grabbed the src.rpm from a local ftp site and

<EM>&gt; compiled it.

<EM>&gt; I'm under the impression that when you install a new release, you get what you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; asked for (or deserve, depending how you see it).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I understand why you might think that but I suspect you
<BR>
don't run many systems. I pay for a distribution because
<BR>
I expect them to sort out what works together to save
<BR>
my time having to do it. That's what I figure I &quot;bought&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Usually, you have spent quite some time setting up your systems, and you know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their quirks, and how they run.  Just installing a new release is like opening
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a whole new can of worms.  I try to avoid it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes but I expect those worms to be sorted out
<BR>
when I spend my $$.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; All my systems still display &quot;RedHat release 5.2&quot; (or even 5.0), but have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evolved over time, when there was some need.  They now tend to run a 2.4.0
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kernel, with glibc 2.2, for example.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think you are better off, in the long run, to reuse your current setup, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; update the necessary pieces.  This way, it won't be such a black box.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, the problem with just updating on your own is
<BR>
first compatiblity between release levels along with
<BR>
the time to mess with it. I don't consider what RH
<BR>
install a black box. I actually try to look at things
<BR>
they installed to make sure they don't do something
<BR>
stupid. I consider xinetd really stupid, but then I
<BR>
know I'm used to the way inetd works and that inetd
<BR>
is pretty standard for the other systems I use. 
<BR>
(AIX/Solaris/etc) Being different than the other
<BR>
Unices is not a good plan if you ask me, particularly
<BR>
if you are interested in the server market. Maybe
<BR>
RH doesn't give a damn about servers.
<BR>
<P>Key places to look for me are /etc/inittab, /etc/rc.d,
<BR>
any /etc/*conf* files, what the heck cron is up to, and
<BR>
look for unexpected socket/services activity.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Setting up a new system is not a problem either: just boot it using some CD
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that came with one of those colorful Linux magazine, and do a minimal install
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in a small partition that will become the swap partition of the new system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then boot this minimal setup, copy &quot;your&quot; current setup from another of your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machines, edit some /etc files, and you are all set, with no nasty surprises.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't install CD's on my systems. They are a wasted
<BR>
resource. I boot a floppy and network install. Eventually
<BR>
I expect to have things do bootp but haven't got that
<BR>
sorted out yet. Alpha SRM does that and I've actually
<BR>
tested it but not to the point that I can get a distribution
<BR>
to install that way. Intel/x86 is behind with respect to
<BR>
network booting but it seems some new systems have a
<BR>
version of network bootable-ness.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I guess I'm a bit old-fashioned, but that's the way I like it.  Needless to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; say, I tend to want to compile all my stuff from source (and tweak the SRPMS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; too, of course :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you just like building things yourself.
<BR>
<P>I've got much more critical applications SW to worry
<BR>
about without having to also worry what RH did to my
<BR>
systems.
<BR>
<P>For example, the x86 box I just installed currently
<BR>
has 320GB of disk and 2 tape libraries attached to
<BR>
it for SW testing. Now I have to go back and install
<BR>
something else. Downloaded Debian today and will 
<BR>
burn CD's tonight. If that goes well, I'll be using
<BR>
Debian from now on.
