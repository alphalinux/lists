<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open Source Momentum
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International Data Corp. (IDC) research states that paid Linux
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shipments grew faster than any other server operating system over the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;past two years, and their preliminary figures for 1999 show Linux
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shipments hold 24.6 percent of the server operating system market, up
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from 15.8 in 1998. IDC also states that Red Hat holds 50.2 percent of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linux vendor market share and that Red Hat Linux is by far the most
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;popular distribution, preferred by 68.7 percent of U.S. Linux users.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research firm Netcraft, Inc. (www.netcraft.com), states that as of May
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2000, 30 percent of all public Web sites run on Linux-based operating
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;systems, making Linux the most popular choice for deploying public Web
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sites. IDC research shows 40 percent of all spending on Linux servers
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is for Internet related applications, firmly entrenching Linux servers
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the Internet infrastructure.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, IDC predicts that by 2002, there will be more than 55 million
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;handheld and notebook-style information appliance devices and that by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2005, shipments of these appliances will exceed shipments of PCs.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Hat's numerous alliances with industry leaders and the demand for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linux-based applications has created open source support from many of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the industry's leading software and hardware manufacturers, including
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dell, Compaq, Computer Associates, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Netscape, Novell, Oracle and SAP.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Hat, Inc.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Founded in 1994, Red Hat (Nasdaq:RHAT), is the leader in development,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deployment and management of Linux and open source solutions for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internet infrastructure ranging from small embedded devices to high

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;award-winning Red Hat Linux server operating system, Red Hat is the
