<P>
Be warned I'm the type that prefers &quot;build it yourself&quot; so I find myself
<BR>
in an unusual posistion...please be on the look out for subtle humor and
<BR>
perhaps sarcasm and spelling mistakes.

<P><EM>&gt; Just a couple points I've noticed about RH7.0
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; running on Intel. RH appear to be moving toward
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the MS model of SW. First there was kudzu, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I always disable. Second, they've added a daemon
</EM><BR>
<P>I always disable KUDZU myself.  The fact that it comes with the distro
<BR>
doesn't bother me.  It takes less than 5 seconds to disable. 
<BR>
<P>The very FIRST time it runs it IS interesting to see what it thinks is in
<BR>
the system.  It correctly idetified a mismarked ethernet card for me once. 
<BR>
If it hadn't been for Kudzu I would have either had to
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. replace the card with a different one
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. pull the card out and realized that the chipset numbers are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;different than the label
<BR>
<P>I'm not a fan of Kudzu, but that one instance saved me serious time in
<BR>
trouble shooting a problem.  I consider it another tool that I keep in the
<BR>
toolbox.  Right next to the Big Hammer.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; called rhnsd which appears to be designed to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; automatically retrieve SW updates for you, again,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I immediately disabled it. Third, they've totally 
</EM><BR>
<P>Again 5 seconds to disable it.  For the people trying to get Linux &quot;to the
<BR>
desktop&quot; this idea makes sense.  Just not for you and me or other l33t
<BR>
haxorz
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; screwed up inetd configuration by switching to xinetd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which looks nothing like inetd and in fact is broken.
</EM><BR>
<P>inetd itself is such a pice of crap I'm suprised you still use it! 
<BR>
Personally I started using Dan Bernstiens TCPserver a LONG time ago when
<BR>
SEVERAL boxes couldn't handle various services (POP3 FTP) under heavy
<BR>
load.  Indetd would take a dump.  (x86 linux, alpha linux, Solaris 2.4,2.5
<BR>
all had the same problem) Never played with xinetd, but almost ANYTHING is
<BR>
an improvement over inetd with a seriously LOADED server.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm sure there are other things I haven't noticed yet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you expect RH to install your devices the way they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see fit and you expect them to update your SW for you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (consider how this could effect a real server) then by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all means install RH7.0.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again great for people that are trying to get into Linux for the first
<BR>
time.  Great when you ship a broken package with your distro and need to
<BR>
upgrade so that &quot;ping&quot; works.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; They've finally crossed the point where I'm actively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looking for another distribution to replace them.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've been playing this game a LONG time.  My first Alpha Linux distro was
<BR>
&quot;craftworks&quot; (anyone remember that??)  I think in the end for advanced
<BR>
users no distro is perfect.  For me I read the lists, and use the most
<BR>
&quot;stable&quot; version if RH.  I do a text install, choose my packages.  Install
<BR>
things from source that I want, ssh, pro-ftp (WU-ftp bleach) and go from
<BR>
there.  Generally a painless procedure once I compile a kernel for that
<BR>
machine I'm done. 
<BR>
<P>Upgrades are generally done a package at a time and only whats needed. 
<BR>
This puts me agreement with the person that reccomends only upgrading the
<BR>
packages you need when you need. That tends to really work for me, YMMV
<BR>
<P>RH as a company is doing a LOT to promote Linux, and I've never had a
<BR>
&quot;show stopper&quot; from them.  So I continue to &quot;remain faithful&quot;.  I feel the
<BR>
same way about Solaris.  Never been a fan of a Solaris install either.
<BR>
<P>I have always been happy with RH Each users mileage varies.  I'm not going
<BR>
to stop using a distro because they are trying to make things easier for
<BR>
the un-initiated.  As long as I can remove or disable the things I don't
<BR>
like (or not install them) I'm happy.  Perhaps, maybe someday RH will
<BR>
change their INSTALL procedure.  All we have to do is ask?
