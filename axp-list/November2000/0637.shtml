<EM>&gt; Agreed.  In fact that version of GCC seems to be a bit more optimized for

<EM>&gt; Alphas.  Yes I've had trouble with it in the x386 world, BUT it's nice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they are trying to get something out that is advantageous to us in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alpha world.  Wish they had waitied for GCC 3.0 and the next kernel

<EM>&gt; release, but I'm just GLAD they are still makeing Alpha releases.

<P>It's *much* better on Alpha than either egcs 1.1.2 or gcc 2.95.2.  I
<BR>
had a post earlier about pitching gcc 2.96 (snapshot) against the
<BR>
native CCC compiler at ALS in Atlanta, and doing pretty well in the
<BR>
Povray race...
<BR>
<P>Further, there are some *really bad* bugs that have been fixed in the
<BR>
Alpha compiler that have been there for quite a while (I'll have to go
<BR>
back and look at my notes, but there was a bad aliased store bug
<BR>
that's been there quite a while.  That was the bug that made emacs go
<BR>
crazy with its lisp stack on and off throught the past 2 years)
