Hell, I work at an ISP and we use nothing BUT Linux (x86)
<BR>
servers.  I also have worked with the other major OS's (Tru64,
<BR>
HPUX, Sun/Solaris, AIX, ad naseum), and I have found that
<BR>
Linux is emminently more configurable than any of the others.
<BR>
It is not as rock solid as Sun is, but I have found the built-in
<BR>
functionality (gcc, apache, working sendmail, pop, named)
<BR>
to more than offset any advantages Sun might have.  In addition
<BR>
to the fact that any security problems you have are fixed in a
<BR>
matter of hours or days, not weeks or months.
<BR>
<P>Plus, frankly, it's free.
<BR>
<P>These are strong advantages I'd be hard-pressed to overlook
<BR>
or ignore.

<EM>&gt; &gt; I am currently setting up an ISP and I am debating on using Linux versus

Unixware 7 or Tru64.  I have read articles from earlier in the year when the
<BR>
benchmarking test had NT out performing Linux as a web platform.  Have all
<BR>
the problems with the SMP support and TCP stack been corrected in Linux 6.1
<BR>
to surpass NT, and can anyone give me their experiences with UW7 and TRU64

in a working environment.

<EM>&gt; I have been running an ISP using Alpha linux systems for several years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now. I also have a few True64 systems. From my point of view linux is well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up to the task of being used for ISP use. I remember early on we were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using DU for our most of our routing. I ended up having a problem with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gated that the folks at DEC were unable to fix. At least with linux I can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get the problem fixed. I may have to do it my self of get a consultant but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can get it fixed. With True64/UnixWare/Solaris/HUPX/AIX ... if you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not a Fortune 3 company you will not be able to afford real support.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We have a number of systems that have been up in excess of 300 days(that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was the last time we did a major upgrade of the OS on a number of our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systems and every body got rebooted.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Most all the various Unix systems are within 5-10% of each other in terms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of performance given the same hardware. This is a general statement and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your milage may vary. So If the licencing cost of the OS is equal to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cost of the hardware you can have 2x the systems if you run linux. So
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unless the application has a specific requirement that can be satisfied by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a specific OS on specific hardware linux will generaly win out on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; price/performance scale.
