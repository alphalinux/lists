Shane,
<BR>
<P>Oops . . . sorry to get cut off.  I agree that Linux can hold it's own
<BR>
in any testing.  The real test is the application you use.  If you are
<BR>
talking web servers then you must look at the methods used by the
<BR>
application.  Does it take advantage of Threads?  SMP?  etc.  You will
<BR>
notice that Apache 1.3.x and Stronghold are not threaded and do not take
<BR>
full advantage of SMP.  However, Zeus does on both counts.  Linux is
<BR>
solid.  Better to look toward your application.
<BR>

<EM>&gt; &gt; I am currently setting up an ISP and I am debating on using Linux versus Unixware 7 or Tru64.  I have read articles from earlier in the year when the benchmarking test had NT out performing Linux as a web platform.  Have all the problems with the SMP support and TCP stack been corrected in Linux 6.1 to surpass NT, and can anyone give me their experiences with UW7 and TRU64 in a working environment.

<EM>&gt; You might like to add a few newlines in there now and then.....

<EM>&gt; The so called `problems' linux has are really blown out of all proportion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SMP works well, the TCP/IP stack in 2.2 wasn't multithreaded and after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pouring over the source code for a long time and they figured they could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rig a test which they knew linux couldn't win against NT.  Of course NT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be nearly 4x quicker than linux on the same hardware when you serve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; static pages down four ethernet adapters bound to individual processors.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, as has been repeatedly stated, this isn't a realistic test.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Better to stick a single Gbit ethernet card on.  Besides, the sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bandwidth they would need to be able to saturate with that system was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beyond ridiculous.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Plenty of ISPs have no problem running their services on Linux.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Try the options in your setting and if linux does the job well enough why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blow a wad on the expensive solutions?  You can always migrate up later,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's not like choosing NT where your only migration option is more NT.
