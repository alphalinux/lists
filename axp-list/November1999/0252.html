<P>Very true.  The scary part of benchmarks like SPECint95 is that CPU
<BR>
manufacturers may target benchmark performance specifically to get an edge
<BR>
over the competition, which does not necessarily benefit real-world code
<BR>
to the same degree.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, doesn't the Alpha have real advantages over x86 (besides clock
<BR>
speed, in which they are now neck-to-neck)?  My asm is a little rusty, but
<BR>
I believe the Alpha has far more GP registers, and can use registers for
<BR>
parameter passing... does that mean it relies less on slow main memory or
<BR>
cache?  Also, the Alpha traps unaligned memory accesses, and the x86
<BR>
ignores them by default... that means they are far more likely to be fixed
<BR>
on Alpha than on x86, even though they still carry a penalty.  I'm sure
<BR>
there are other differences that I can't think of right now.
<BR>
<P>I write business software.  I don't need fp performance.  Typical business
<BR>
software really isn't heavy integer processing, as some others have
<BR>
claimed.  Rather it is very heavy on data processing, i.e. memory and
<BR>
disk-intensive.  Large amounts of RAM are common to exploit disk caching
<BR>
to the fullest.  Large processor cache helps too.  Any tricks to avoid
<BR>
memory fetches and processor stalls are beneficial.  The importantance
<BR>
of clock speed diminishes as much processor time is spent waiting for
<BR>
memory or bus.
<BR>
<P>The Alpha seems to cope well.  Most of our software I've tested on Alpha
<BR>
performs as well as or better than the x86 version (both compiled with
<BR>
gcc).  I realize I don't have the latest and fastest PIII, but then I
<BR>
don't have a 264 either... I guess I'm working with the previous
<BR>
generation of both architectures.
