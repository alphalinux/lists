<P>
Just wanted to let people know what my problem was with my ATI Xpert98
<BR>
card that I couldn't get to work...  The first thing I did when I got RH
<BR>
6.0 installed on my UDB was to compile the newest stable kernel (2.2.13).
<BR>
Since I knew I was going to be using a video card, I did not compile in
<BR>
support for the TGA framebuffer.  Right off the bat, I was able to get a
<BR>
Permedia2 card working with the 3D Labs server.  For the most part, this
<BR>
worked flawlessly.  However, when I tried to use the Mach64 server with my
<BR>
Xpert98 card the server would die as soon as my machine switched to vt7.
<BR>
I'm not sure why, but as soon as I went back to the RH 6.0 kernel
<BR>
(2.2.5-16), and disabled the framebuffer with &quot;video=tga:off&quot;, the Mach64
<BR>
server started up without any problems.  Any ideas why the the server
<BR>
wouldn't work with my 2.2.13 kernel, but the 3DLabs server would?
