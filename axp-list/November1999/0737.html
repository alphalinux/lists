I do not understand. M$ is not a hardware manufacturer. It would be difficult to
<BR>
make a new architecture without some folks knowing about it.

<P>It probably not any more strange than 'digitals' proprietaryness that it once
<BR>
had with its alpha chips, and chip neighborhood. Folks still have problems
<BR>
getting the jenson ( an axp 150 ) and the 3000 running. Now if i could only get
<BR>
one of those Free Adaptec SCSI programming manuala that seem to be FOREVER out
<BR>
of STOCK :-/

<EM>&gt; &gt; I've got some friends that are effectively looking to port linux to another
