<P>
<EM>&gt; I want to update everyone in the same vein...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've achieved new heights of stability by statically linking the sound
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drivers and *not* using modules.  I still have to use the plug and play
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; driver, which complains of irq conflicts on boot, but my sound card
</EM><BR>
wouldn't
<BR>
<EM>&gt; be properly initialized without it.
</EM><BR>
<P>still using modules here...... there's not a problem with the modules (at
<BR>
least not in my setup)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've been up for 3 1/2 days with constant sound use, and I'm listening to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mp3's right now as I type this!
</EM><BR>
<P>yeah that's what I was doing when mine was still running... except 2 1/2
<BR>
days
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why is the system so unstable when the sound drivers are built as
</EM><BR>
modules???
<BR>
<P>don't think it's the module stuff....
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't know.  But if this keeps up, I'll be very happy!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Kurt, I'm curious...  Were you filling all your RAM slots when you were
</EM><BR>
using
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 384MB?  It's possible that if you weren't and had your motherboard
</EM><BR>
jumpered
<BR>
<P>yes all the RAM slots were filled (2x64MB and 2x128MB 4 RAM slots total)
<BR>
<P>I need to check on the access level... I'm pretty sure that I'm using
<BR>
whatever the default is for a 164SX board.
<BR>
I'd get the PDF of the manual, but our network here @ UML is a mess per
<BR>
usual. I never changed it, so I would assume it's the default.
<BR>
Kurt
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; for 256-bit memory accesses, that your system was screwing up.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm pretty sure that the 256-bit memory access can only be used if you
</EM><BR>
fill
<BR>
<EM>&gt; *all* the RAM slots.  I could be wrong, but it's a thought.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have 64MB ( 4 X 4MBx36 ) and I have my board jumpered for 128-bit
</EM><BR>
accesses.
<BR>
