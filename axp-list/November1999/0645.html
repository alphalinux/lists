<P>
The Register article is really misleading.  They write:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Compaq yesterday launched a supercomputer based on its Alpha technology,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and in passing, decided to kick rival Silicon Graphics in the chops.
</EM><BR>
[...]
<BR>
<EM>&gt; According to the Big Q, the AlphaServer SC puts the company in a position
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where it is a contender to sell high end systems costing over a million
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bucks. Compaq claimed that the Alpha chip now powers five out of the 10 most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; powerful machines in the known universe, and has displaced SGI from its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; position as market share leader in this sector.
</EM><BR>
<P>As any number of people on the list have noted, they totally neglect to
<BR>
mention that those Alpha boxes are all SGI/Cray T3E supercomputers.  And
<BR>
there's a minor factual error; the new list released last week only has
<BR>
*four* Alpha-based T3Es; the fifth had been the T3E at the UK Met Office
<BR>
but ASCI Blue Pacific (an IBM SP) knocked it to #11.  But that difference
<BR>
could be because they got old information from Compaq.
<BR>
<P>I suspect that by saying &quot;displaced SGI&quot;, they're really trying to say
<BR>
&quot;displaced the MIPS-based SGI Origin 2000&quot;.  Even so, it's not all that
<BR>
accurate a statement.
<BR>
<P>Terry Shannon is quoted later in the article as saying, more correctly:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &quot;On a CPU architecture basis, Alpha is number one across the board in HPTC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  (thanks in part to the Cray parallel processors).&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>In large part, I'd say.
