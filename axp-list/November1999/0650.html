<EM>&gt; As any number of people on the list have noted, they totally neglect to

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there's a minor factual error; the new list released last week only has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *four* Alpha-based T3Es; the fifth had been the T3E at the UK Met Office
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but ASCI Blue Pacific (an IBM SP) knocked it to #11.  But that difference

<EM>&gt; could be because they got old information from Compaq.

<P>This is incorrect.  The one 512 CPU Compaq machine is a new cluster
<BR>
architecture that Compaq is selling.  It is a 128 node ES40 cluster
<BR>
with a Quadrics interconnect.  We just had one delivered to LLNL last
<BR>
month (though at the moment most nodes have a single CPU).  We may see
<BR>
more nodes added next year but I am not sure if they have plans to
<BR>
build them larger or not.  I'm working on a smaller scale (8 nodes 32
<BR>
CPUs) of the same machine porting most of the software to Linux.
<BR>
We've hit a few hurdles but nothing major.  There are quite a few
<BR>
features that the commercial OSs have that Linux lacks, I'm hoping we
<BR>
can incorporate some of them into the main kernel.
