<EM>&gt; This is WRONG. It doesn't work. Please somebody organise proper boot disks.

<P>Assuming you have an Alpha already running, you can 
<BR>
use whatever kernel you want on the boot disk. It's
<BR>
just an ext2fs. Just build what you want and copy it
<BR>
to the floppy after removing the old one. I always
<BR>
build generic kernels now and I have 4 different Alpha
<BR>
types the kernels work on. (PC164/PC164LX/XP1000/DS10)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think one of the problems is some of the systems don't recognise the file
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system being used.  I don't have a linux box running at the moment so I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't even see what's on the Red Hat boot disk.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>You can't use a RH5.2 kernel for RH6.0 due to the ramdisk
<BR>
being a romfs now instead of an ext2fs. If you went out
<BR>
hunting for a model dependent kernel, you most likely
<BR>
found a RH5.2 based one and that's why it didn't work for
<BR>
you.
