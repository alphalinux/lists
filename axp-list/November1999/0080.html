<P>
<EM>&gt; I was hoping to gain your insight regarding SNII.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I'm about half-ignorant about ServerNet II because it's not quite out
<BR>
yet.
<BR>
<P>From reading the glossy brochures, it seems that SNII has the capability of
<BR>
producing big, cheap networks, much like Myrinet. However, just like
<BR>
Giganet, it seems that the market that SNII is aimed at is the business
<BR>
world, and the business world thinks 32 nodes is big. So, my flippant
<BR>
analysis was: &quot;They could do great things, but odds are they won't do great
<BR>
things for ME.&quot; So, when I see prices, I expect the switches to be too big
<BR>
and too expensive.
<BR>
<P>Note that Compaq has 3 strategies going at once: Fiber Channel, ServerNet
<BR>
II, and Quadrics. Quadrics is what the HPC group is using for system
<BR>
interconnect, but they'd like to move to pure &quot;wildfire&quot; solutions (and btw,
<BR>
wildfire machines are now being demoed at trade shows... they should have
<BR>
one at SC99.) FC is used to attach storage, but not as a system
<BR>
interconnect. And SNII, well, I don't really know what they're going to use
<BR>
it for beyond the Tandem line. So, I doubt.
<BR>
<P>I would love to see more competition for interconnect in the 64-1024 node
<BR>
size. We would all win.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I suppose I can wait to gain more specifics at SC99.
</EM><BR>
<P>See you there.
