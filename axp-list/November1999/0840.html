<P>
Some of you might have heard of Satori Paint. It is one of the best paint
<BR>
programs around, and one of the few that were available for Alpha NT.
<BR>
<P>While we already have Gimp, this program has a lot of features more mature
<BR>
than Gimp and it has some very professional tools used in serious prodution
<BR>
environments.
<BR>
<P>Mark Lister from SatoriPaint posted this to the Satori Mailing List. I have
<BR>
talked to Mark a couple of times regarding Linux and I am taking this message
<BR>
from him as a possible good sign.
<BR>
<P>Please take the time and send them feedback. This program is well worth
<BR>
having.............
<BR>
<P><P>Dear Linux/MacOS/BeOS supporters,
<BR>
<P>We have had many earlier requests to develop Satori versions for Linux, MacOSX
<BR>
and/or BeOS.  The most popular request is currenty for MacOSX version.
<BR>
<P>If you would like Satori to be available for any one of these operating
<BR>
systems then we would welcome your feedback and encouragement. You could
<BR>
complete an independent survey as suggested by Michael Mannall (below), email
<BR>
sales@satoripaint.com or vote directly by emailing the appropriate address
<BR>
below. It will be interesting to see if the popularitry of a Linux version
<BR>
exceeds MacOSX.
<BR>
<P>Linux@satoripaint.com
<BR>
MacOS@satoripaint.com
<BR>
BeOS@satoripaint.com
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Now would be a good time for them to get in when there is little competition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from others, giving them a head start on what will possibly (hopefully) be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the next main OS.
</EM><BR>
<P>You might be surprised to hear that we are ready to start porting Satori to
<BR>
MacOSX, Linux or BeOS but are not prepared to make a commitment alone to a new
<BR>
version. However, we would be willing to complete this work as a develoment
<BR>
priority provided that we are able to source a software publisher and/or
<BR>
investor that is willing to fund the porting and help support the marketing
<BR>
and distribution activities.
<BR>
<P>If there is indeed an early market opportunity for a new Satori version then
<BR>
this invitation should generate many applicants, especially given the likely
<BR>
high potential return on investment.
<BR>
<P>We are a small independent developer and have already privately invested $1.6M
<BR>
and eight years of R &amp; D in Satori 2D gaphics technology. The investment
<BR>
required to sponsor new versions is relatively insignificant and we welcome
<BR>
any interest in this new business opportunity.
<BR>
<P>If you would like to find out more about investing in a Satori version for
<BR>
Linux, BeOS or MacOSX and/or would like to nominate a suitable
<BR>
investor/publisher then please email me directly.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
