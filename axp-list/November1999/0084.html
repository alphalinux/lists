<P>Maybe you're right, Greg... but from what I've seen (and I'm not testing
<BR>
state-of-the-art hardware here) the Alphas are very cost-effective.
<BR>
It's true that just about any modern hardware is overkill for a plain
<BR>
static site.  But I've been disappointed with the performance of our Intel
<BR>
machines for database-driven sites.  SPECmarks aren't everything ya
<BR>
know... (and I did say _might benefit_, after all).
<BR>
<P>I'm talking about a $2500 164LX to, say, a 400MHz PII.  I don't have hard
<BR>
figures but let me just say the LX holds its own very well.  At the very
<BR>
least it's a very tight race.  (Which is to say I don't understand why so
<BR>
many folks insist on SPARC boxen for web serving... they seem to lose on
<BR>
price and performance.)
<BR>
<P>SMP is another story... 2 or 4-CPU Alphas are very expensive.  (But my
<BR>
4-way Intel machines are somewhat underwhelming in performance... they
<BR>
seem to bottleneck easily on bus traffic.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That's why Compaq's marketing push for the Alpha for web farms is a bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weird...
</EM><BR>
<P>It's just industry competition I'd suspect... aren't HP, IBM and Sun doing
<BR>
about the same?
