<P>
Mozilla M11 built successfully for me on my first try.  This is approximately
<BR>
where my success with M11 ended. :) It runs (asking me to create a user
<BR>
profile). However, I immediately notice that I can't type text into the text
<BR>
box asking me to name my profile.  I can, however, click the button to accept
<BR>
the default and get out of the Wizard, so I do so.  A bit later, the Mozilla
<BR>
window opens and begins to load one of the pages off of mozilla.org.
<BR>
<P>One thing I notice quickly is the dynamic page rendering.  Nice trick, but it
<BR>
seems to kill performance during a page load (eats 100% CPU during the entire
<BR>
page load).  The stop button, as cool as it looks, doesn't seem to respond
<BR>
during this loading.  This behavior has been mentioned by Intel users too, so
<BR>
I suppose it isn't an Alpha=ism.  The other thing I immediately notice is the
<BR>
sidebar on the left. Shrinking it does strange things to the Mozilla window. 
<BR>
Luckily, it can be turned off via the menus.
<BR>
<P>Ahh yes, the menus.  I'm not sure what the problem is (others have also
<BR>
reported this behavior), but trying to bring up the menus takes an eternity. 
<BR>
Despite the apparent speed of the rendering engine (which seems to render the
<BR>
HTML I've run through it nicely), the UI is slow.  Extremely slow.  Unusably
<BR>
slow if you actually want to use the menus.  Menus shouldn't pop up several
<BR>
seconds after you click them.
<BR>
<P>And now, the showstopper.  I wasn't able to enter text into any textbox into
<BR>
Mozilla.  The URL bar wouldn't accept text input.  Okay - I'm used to that (I
<BR>
usually browse with Mozilla 100898).  Unfortunately, &quot;Open URL&quot; wouldn't take
<BR>
any input either.  The only way I could specify a URL was to do so on the
<BR>
command line.  Speaking of text boxes, I wasn't able to enter any text in HTML
<BR>
forms either.  Or in any text box in the preferences dialogs.  Or - well,
<BR>
anywhere in Mozilla.  This makes using it as a web browser rather -
<BR>
challenging. :)
<BR>
<P>On the upside, I was able to get viewer to accept text input.  It had the same
<BR>
problem with forms until I switched (menu option) gadget rendering to &quot;native&quot;.
<BR>
&nbsp;Viewer is almost usable as a browser now.  It just seems to be missing the
<BR>
&quot;stop&quot; button to keep it from sucking CPU if one image (say from an ad server)
<BR>
is keeping a page load from completing and sucking up CPU.
<BR>
<P>In a nutshell:
<BR>
Upsides-
<BR>
* Nice HTML rendering.  Much better than the previous milestones and 100898
<BR>
* Nice looking (and theoretically changable - haven't experimented) interface
<BR>
* You at least get part of a page while waiting for page loading
<BR>
* Preferences dialog now exists
<BR>
* Viewer is looking better and better. :)
<BR>
<P>Downsides-
<BR>
* Sluggish.  Lots of debug code?
<BR>
* The nice looking interface doesn't work so well.
<BR>
* Can't enter text into anything.
<BR>
<P>The test system is an AS200 4/233 with 96 megs of RAM.  OS is RH 5.1 + various
<BR>
updates.  GTK version is 1.2.6.  I expected some Mozilla instability since I'm
<BR>
not running glibc 2.1.  I'm not certain if that was related to my other
<BR>
problems with M11.  I've not had time to research these issues much farther.
