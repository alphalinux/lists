<P>
I didn't!
<BR>
<P>I'm running SuSE on my Alphas. I made this choice partly to spite my
<BR>
RedHat-fanatic collegues, partly because I'd been recommended it. Being new
<BR>
to Linux (or U*x in general for that matter), I had no preferences to start
<BR>
with.
<BR>
<P>I'm mostly lurking on this list; to gather whatever hints I can find, to
<BR>
contribute some occasional message on my own, when the topic is, e.g.
<BR>
firmware or hardware related, or like this, generic.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I hope you RedHat users had an easier time installing than I had...
<BR>
The SuSE manual contains just about the exact amount of information to make
<BR>
it *possible* for you to install from ARC (which I did on my Multia), *if*
<BR>
you know your Alphas and know what the ARC environment variables are all
<BR>
about. Installing from SRM (which I did on my AS200) is impossible, if you
<BR>
just follow the manual with no prior Unix knowledge (just imagine my
<BR>
confusion when reading the single instruction &quot;create BSD partitions&quot;).
<BR>
However, the excellent Alpha installation guide provided by Compaq gave me
<BR>
the necessary clues to complete the installation.

<P><P>After hanging out on the FreeBSD Alpha list, Debian Alpha, and chatting via
<BR>
email, I have one really big honkin' question..
<BR>
<P>What made people on this list choose Red Hat as their Linux?  This is not a
<BR>
question of challenge, I like Red Hat, but I want to know what is that drove
<BR>
YOU to install it over Debian, Turbo, Stampede, or SuSE.. Is it the way Red
<BR>
Hat supports Linux?  The way it runs?  The way it installs?  I'm really
<BR>
anxious to know everyones' opinion.  Certainly you must know that some of
<BR>
the die-hard users of other distros think their's is &quot;true to the meaning of
<BR>
Linux&quot; and not-so-commercial..
