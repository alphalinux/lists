<EM>&gt; &gt; I believe the gnome version of midnight commander (gmc) creates those.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I've not found that they are 'harmful', albeit annoying.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well this likely depends on a version of mc (gmc) you are using.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have here both at 4.5.40-1 and they are definitely not doing anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of that sort.  I tried for a short while the stuff which came with 6.0.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As far as I am concerned it was totally useless.
</EM><BR>
<P>This was happening to me here as well. For what it is worth, everything
<BR>
seemed to settle down here once I upgraded the fontserver (xfs) to the
<BR>
version from the &quot;Rawhide&quot; distribution. I don't think it is a problem
<BR>
with gmc at all. The X lockups when opening some files with xpdf or gv
<BR>
which were *really* annoying have all disappeared.
<BR>
<P>The only ongoing problem I have noticed is that &quot;upgrading&quot; to RH 6.0
<BR>
broke em86 and therefore my ability to run Netscape. That's not to say
<BR>
that there are no other problems, just that I haven't come across them
<BR>
so far.
