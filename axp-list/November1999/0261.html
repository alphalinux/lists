OK I've realised I was wrong.  The RH boot disks probably aren't broken.
<BR>
<P>With a large probability the situation is that the version of MILO supplied
<BR>
with RH6.0 supports romfs.
<BR>
<P>Unforetunately the RH6.0 version of MILO doesn't work on the Multia I have.
<BR>
&nbsp;It's only got 16MB so maybe it's running out of memory as Multia's are
<BR>
meant to come with 24M.
<BR>
<P>I've been booting using a Debian version of Milo which I assumed would be
<BR>
much the same as the RH Milo.
<BR>
<P>Anybody got a contact address for the RH people working on Milo? Can I get
<BR>
a version of Milo which supports romfs and fits in 16M?
<BR>
<P>Thanks to those who emailed me.
<BR>
<P>Adam.
