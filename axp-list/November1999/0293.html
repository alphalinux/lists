<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Very true.  The scary part of benchmarks like SPECint95 is that CPU
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; manufacturers may target benchmark performance specifically to get an
</EM><BR>
edge
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; over the competition, which does not necessarily benefit real-world
</EM><BR>
code
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to the same degree.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; That's why SPECint and SPECfp are mostly composed of real-world codes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And that's why people that know better only consider SPEC95 as a _very_
</EM><BR>
relative
<BR>
<EM>&gt; measure of specific performance and not a good systemic view of any
</EM><BR>
system.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Anyone who even talks of things in terms of SPEC95 as if it's a
</EM><BR>
&quot;real-world&quot;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; measure of actual performance just plain doesn't understand SPEC.  That's
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; biggest reason SPEC2000 is (hopefully) just around the corner.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Huh?  So SPECcpu2000 is going to fix this SPECcpu95 'problem' and provide a
<BR>
single number which is a good relative measure of computer system
<BR>
performance which is relevant for all applications?  I would have thought
<BR>
that was only possible if all applications made the same demands on a
<BR>
computer system.
<BR>
<P>As unpalatable is it is to everyone, there's never going to be a single
<BR>
number which provides an accurate measure of computer system performance for
<BR>
all applications.
<BR>
<P>As Greg mentioned, SPECint and SPECfp (both 95 and 2000 ) are made up of
<BR>
real world application codes.  If the committee chose your application for
<BR>
inclusion, you can just look at that component score to see how a computer
<BR>
system will perform
<BR>
for you.  If not, the best benchmark is still to run your own application.
<BR>
<P>Here's a real world example of the range of performance possible.  SPECcpu
<BR>
scores are calculated as a ratio of the tested machines performance to the
<BR>
performance of some lowly SPARC system.  A 667 MHz UP2000 ranges from 19 to
<BR>
134 times faster than this reference system.  That's more than a 7 times
<BR>
difference in performance.  Even comparing the 2nd highest to the 2nd lowest
<BR>
score gives a differential of more than 4x.  That's still a pretty big
<BR>
difference when Intel and AMD are beating each other silly over a few
<BR>
percentage points difference in performance.
<BR>
<P>The bottom line is that SPECcpu numbers are merely meant to be general
<BR>
indicators of performance.  As benchmarks go, SPECcpu95 is OK, although a
<BR>
little out of date.  SPECcpu2000 will be a little bit better and a little
<BR>
bit more current, but it's not going to be any magic bullet that provides
<BR>
the one true number to measure systems by.
