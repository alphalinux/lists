<P>
To everyone who asked, I have a PC164 running 6.0 with kernel 2.2.9, which
<BR>
seems the most stable out of all the 2.2 and 2.3 versions I've built.
<BR>
I've tried gcc 2.91, 2.95.1 and even 2.95.2.  I settled on gcc-2.7.2.3 and
<BR>
kernel 2.2.9 after lots of freezes and grief.  This combo gives me the most
<BR>
uptime, but I still have freezes.  I used to have freezes that were network
<BR>
related, but after juggling different ethernet cards and different slots,
<BR>
I settled on a NetGear with the Tulip driver as a module.  No more network
<BR>
freezes.  
<BR>
My sound drivers are built as modules.  For variety, I tried building the
<BR>
&quot;OSS modules&quot; option statically so I could use the &quot;Persistent DMA buffers&quot;
<BR>
option, but the actual sound drivers are modules.  I don't have a desktop
<BR>
Intel PC, so I can't set the sound card's i/o, irq, and dma to fixed values.
<BR>
I'm stuck using the PnP and sound drivers as modules.
<BR>
My sound card is an original SB16 ISA PnP card.  I've built my kernels as
<BR>
generic and also as PC164 specific, both with and without leaving the SRM
<BR>
PCI setup intact.  No difference.  I still get freezes most notably when playing
<BR>
mp3's (within seconds) and when playing xmame (at random).
<BR>
A friend of mine with a PC164 and soundblaster has the same problem I do, and
<BR>
I know other people on this list have voiced their similar problems.
<BR>
Would it make that much of a difference if I was able to statically link in
<BR>
the sound drivers to the kernel?  Again, I'd have to get to a PC in order to
<BR>
run Creative's config program.  My conf.modules file is as follows:
<BR>
<P>alias parport_lowlevel parport_pc 
<BR>
alias eth0 tulip 
<BR>
alias sound sb
<BR>
pre-install sound insmod sound
<BR>
alias midi opl3
<BR>
options opl3 io=0x388
<BR>
options sb io=0x220 irq=5 dma=1 mpu_io=0x330
<BR>
<P>The &quot;pre-install sound&quot; line used to have &quot;dmabuf=1&quot; at the end, but I tried
<BR>
removing it when I tried out the &quot;Presistent DMA buffers&quot; kernel option.
<BR>
No difference.  Is there some peculiar problem with the Saturn I/O PCI-ISA
<BR>
bridge driver on the PC164?  Could it be an IRQ problem?  I noticed someone
<BR>
else is using their soundcard on IRQ 10 instead of 5.
<BR>
All suggestions welcome.  I hope I can get RedHat's attention, as I've filed
<BR>
a bug report with them.
<BR>
<P>-Mark
