<EM>&gt;Ugh... I hate to reply to my own message, but it appears my system is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not an SX164, it's a plain PC164.  The machine was sold to me as an SX,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and I didn't think to verify that.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I was able to switch to SRM by getting the files from the correct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;directory on Gatekeeper, copying fwupdate.exe and the .rom file to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fat-formatted floppy, and selecting &quot;Update Firmware&quot; in the ARC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;console.

Well, that sounded easy enough, so I thought &quot;Why not give it a try ?&quot;
<BR>
(Mine's a PC164 too.) It was easy.
<BR>
<P>Discovering how to boot from an aboot-floppy, mounting / from harddisk, was
<BR>
the next step. Easy too.
<BR>
<P>Converting the disklabel to BSD-format, while retaining the existing
<BR>
partitions. I got myself into trouble on this one (at one time I was
<BR>
running from a disk that had no label at all, and fdisk suddenly decided on
<BR>
a different geometry....) but pulled it off.
<BR>
<P>Installed aboot to boot from the harddisk. OK.
<BR>
<P>Some issues I ran into:
<BR>
- aboot seems to get in a funny state if you pass the wrong parameters. It
<BR>
seems to go on to interactive mode, but everything I try after that will
<BR>
fail. Hit reset and try again.
<BR>
- SRM (and aboot) enumerate the PCI-bus in reverse order (compared to ARC &amp;
<BR>
kernel) which results in a switch of the harddisks. Once I found out what
<BR>
was going on this wasn't a problem.
<BR>
- In BSD-style partition tables use type 8 for ext2, not 0x83. Your kernel
<BR>
won't mind, but aboot will.
<BR>
<P>And some questions:
<BR>
- should I ever want to return to ARC, where can I get the firmware image ?
<BR>
PC164 will not hold both, so setting OS_TYPE and restarting will not be
<BR>
sufficient. OTOH, SRM seems to have a command to start ARC from floppy. Any
<BR>
experiences ?
<BR>
- next step would be to try and run TruDU and/or OpenVMS. Anyone been
<BR>
there, done that ? Hardware is as follows:
<BR>
Aspen Durango mainboard (= PC164)
<BR>
sym810a + sym875 SCSI adapters
<BR>
IBM discs (2GB fast + 4.3GB ultra)
<BR>
S3 Trio64V+ graphics card
<BR>
NEC 3x CDROM
<BR>
3Com 509B 10Mb ISA + 905B 100Mb PCI network.
<BR>
- and does anyone know when noncommercial TruDU will be available for the
<BR>
rest of the world (which is the part I belong to ?)
<BR>
<P>Groeten,
<BR>
Geerten.
