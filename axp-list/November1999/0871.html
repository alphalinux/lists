&quot;T&quot;s are actually in the SCSI spec, though they are called &quot;stubs&quot;, and all
<BR>
SCSI buses have them.  The spec allows for a maximum stub length for SCSI-2
<BR>
of 10cm.  Ultra/LVD likely change this max length.  Note that most devices
<BR>
already have about 5cm stub length internally (the wiring from the SCSI
<BR>
connector to the SCSI drivers on the PCB).  This gives you a &quot;usable&quot; length
<BR>
of about 5cm, or about 2 inches -- not much cable length at all ;-)
<BR>
<P>There are two different types of converters for going from 68-&gt;50 pins --
<BR>
with or without termination.  To answer the original posters's question, it
<BR>
is likely that you'll need a converter that terminates the upper 8bits of
<BR>
the wide bus.  The best source I've found for excellent quality SCSI cables
<BR>
and terminators is &quot;Granite Digital&quot; (<A HREF="http://www.scsipro.com">http://www.scsipro.com</A>) and they have
<BR>
a 68-&gt;50 pin converter that automatically terminates the high byte of the
<BR>
bus.  If you use this cable, the converter MUST be placed at the physical
<BR>
end of the cable.  In the poster's case, this would mean that the LAST 68pin
<BR>
connector must be connected to the backplane/external connector.
<BR>
<P>When you have a SCSI card that has 3 connectors -- only 2 may be used at any
<BR>
one time to prevent violation of SCSI stub-length maximums.

Subject: RE: narrow device connected to a wide scsi

<P><P><EM>&gt; what happens if I use one of this scsi-backplane connector that connect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; directly to the internal wide scsi cable, not at the end of the bus, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make one more external connector, then I can put there my tape without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; terminator. I'm right?

The SCSI Cable must be a single linear chain.  You are putting a T in it,
<BR>
and this wont work reliably.
<BR>
The only way the 68-50 pin adapter should be used is to plug directly into
<BR>
the back of a 50 pin drive,
<BR>
as there is no T that way.  I would recommend using an external 68 pin with
<BR>
and external 68 pin terminator at the end of the chain.  Place the tape
<BR>
drive in between the teminator and the system, and remove its termination
<BR>
and use that of the terminator.  Use the 68-50 to plug directlry into the
<BR>
back of the tape unit.
<BR>
This applies if you are trying to run any ultra speeds on the 68 pin cable.
<BR>
If you arent, you might be able to get away with a less than compliant
<BR>
solution.
