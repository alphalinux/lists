<P><EM>&gt; Hi,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The Linux world is not going to survive and gain widespread acceptance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;on free software alone.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Hm, are you sure ? I don't have any commercial software yet on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my Alpha running Linux. (how many of you guys do ?????)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IMHO,the tendency is there is less and less people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; willing to pay for software on their desktop.
</EM><BR>
<P>When I mentioned widespread acceptance, I include the average user, the
<BR>
corporate user and others. Not just the die hard fans.
<BR>
<P>Houdini is ported to Linux, you do not think this is going to be free do you?
<BR>
How about Maya? Oracle isn't free either.
<BR>
<P>And yes, I am quite sure that commercial application support is crucial to
<BR>
the long term success of the platform. Surely you do not think that the Alpha
<BR>
platform has much of a future as nothing more elegant than a vehicle for
<BR>
freebie software?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt;I see no reason for commercial software to be treated as if it were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;something evil.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't. I just don't see reason to plug commercial software here either.
</EM><BR>
<P>Who was plugging commercial software? Satori might port their paint package
<BR>
if the interest is there. As there is no Satori Paint for Alpha  Linux, this
<BR>
can hardly be considered a plug for commercial software that does not exist.
<BR>
While you personally may only be interested in the freebies you can download,
<BR>
some of us use Alpha and Linux in a professional environment. Something the
<BR>
free software market is amazingly weak in implementing software for.
<BR>
<P>If not here, how would anyone know that they were even considering it? as an
<BR>
Alpha user, a professional user at that, ANY tools that are or may become
<BR>
available to myself or others is of considerable interest, and certainly is
<BR>
NOT off topic on this list or any other Linux list.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt;As for being on the right list, well, no rules against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;talking about commercial software.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You're right. But from what you wrote , it looks as if these people are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a long way from porting to Linux Alpha , as there is not yet a version
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for Intel Linux available yet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There's no rules against talking about vapourware (tm) either.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not necessarily. I have talked to them numerous times on the subject. As far
<BR>
as being a long way off, they asked to see if people were interested. If they
<BR>
get no response, then it is a dead issue. Sad because their software is not
<BR>
even all that expensive considering what it does. And they are one of the
<BR>
VERY FEW who even supported Alpha at all.
