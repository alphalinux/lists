<P>
<EM>&gt; Now Compaq is opening its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cards at least, and yes DECUS Singapore had free attendance for all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sponsored by Compaq (over 600 highly relevant attendees; interesting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; program; good food) and good Tru64 and Linux sessions. Now let's see how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; API sales conf in Boston goes on in a week or so 
</EM><BR>
<P>Now that I've got my slides finished for the API Sales Symposium I can get
<BR>
caught back up on this thread.
<BR>
<P>I'm not sure how our food will compare to the vaunted DECUS Singapore food,
<BR>
but we will be talking with our resellers about both current and future
<BR>
products at the Sales Symposium next week.  As far as the 1.795 GHz EV74
<BR>
which Compaq says they will ship July 17, 2001, all I can say is that if you
<BR>
think about the supply chain, product qualification cycles, and past
<BR>
performance, it's pretty clear that API will be shipping any given speed bin
<BR>
before Compaq.  Although we supply the chips to them the delay isn't because
<BR>
we get access to the parts earlier, but rather because they are typically
<BR>
trying to do much more complex systems with the higher speed parts, so they
<BR>
have longer qualification cycles.
