<P><EM>&gt; What made people on this list choose Red Hat as their Linux?  This is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not a question of challenge, I like Red Hat, but I want to know what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is that drove YOU to install it over Debian, Turbo, Stampede, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SuSE.. Is it the way Red Hat supports Linux?  The way it runs?  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way it installs?  I'm really anxious to know everyones' opinion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Certainly you must know that some of the die-hard users of other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distros think their's is &quot;true to the meaning of Linux&quot; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not-so-commercial..
</EM><BR>
<P>Heck, at the time I didn't even have a choise, Red Hat was the 
<BR>
only Linux distro that had a (very good!) Alpha port.
<BR>
<P>I liked the way Red Hat was organised so I sticked with it,
<BR>
the only thing I don't like is RPM, I prefer the DIY approach.
<BR>
Note that I'm not Joe average user, I only install the bare 
<BR>
needed base and then compile all stuff I need myself.
<BR>
<P>I'm also running Red Hat because they pioneered porting Linux to
<BR>
non-i386 platforms, like Alpha and SPARC. They also did (and do)
<BR>
a lot to promote Linux and to get the Big Players involved in it.
<BR>
Plus, RH gives everything they've developed back to the community,
<BR>
and they distribute it under the GPL license (like it should:) ).
<BR>
So in a way, commercial based != bad thing. 
<BR>
<P>I've never needed RH support, so I can't comment about that.
<BR>
As long you avoid their .0 releases it's okay :)
<BR>
RH is quick releasing updates and bugfix rpms, but that applies 
<BR>
to all major Linux distro's.
<BR>
<P>For what it's worth, I've only seen SuSE, Turbo and Stampede
<BR>
on i386 boxen, IMHO, they all are very RH like/based.
<BR>
<P>Debian also makes a fine, well tested and stable Linux distro,
<BR>
but what I personally don't like is the very strict .deb system.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, you can't really go wrong with any of them, heck, it's all
<BR>
Linux after all. I think it comes down to personal preferences.
<BR>
<P>Final note, I personally DO prefer NetBSD and FreeBSD (especially
<BR>
for servers), unfortunally they don't run on my AlphaBIOS Alpha's :(
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
