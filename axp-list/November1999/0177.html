<EM>&gt; Note this, it will come in useful later.

<P>Yes, lets do that.

<P><EM>&gt; &gt; the Athlon would have a peak performance of 2GFLOPS at 500MHZ, Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since I was comparing integer performance with x86 chips I don't see why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you should be bringing up fp performance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>If it's integer performance, Athlons will do better against
<BR>
Alpha than they do with FP. Specint95_base on an Athlon 600 is 27.5.
<BR>
Specint95 on Alpha 21164 600 is 18.4. There is no 600MHZ 21264
<BR>
so I can't quote it's performance. The 466MHZ 21264 Specint95 is 24.6
<BR>
and the 667MHZ 21264 is 37.5. Note this is all done using compilers,
<BR>
no hand coded ASM allowed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The point is that at the present moment in time a basic dual pipeline
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 21164A processor at 600 Mhz is more than twice as quick as a 400Mhz PII
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; running purely integer code compiled with egcs on both machines.  Using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ccc makes the Alpha execute the same code around 30% quicker again.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; '264 has four integer pipelines and features to make it better able to use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those to full effect (out of order execution for instance) and as such it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can be expected to be faster again clock for clock, I heard 2-2.5x faster
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than a '164.
</EM><BR>
<P>The Athlon is capable of nine operations per clock, 3 integer,
<BR>
3 address, and 3 FP. The Specint95 indicates they did something 
<BR>
right.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For the work I am involved in the extra benefits of the long word make a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; '164 10x quicker than an x86 processor clock for clock which makes them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very economical.  I haven't tried the code on a '264 but I expect the code
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will perform very well there maybe with a little massaging to fit the code
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the architecture a bit better.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Must be highly unusual code. I suppose you're doing cryptography
<BR>
or some such if it's all integer based work.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What is different about the way we code here is that pour over the data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sheets on the architecture and write our code accordingly, this behaviour
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has gained us a performance benefit of a factor of three from when we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first moved our code from SGI R10000 to Alpha.  We are now working on an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MPI version of the code and running test jobs on a pair of '164s we have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sitting here and the results are very encouraging.  To get the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; performance as these two '164 boxes (that cost us around $4000US for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pair) you would need 20 x86 boxes of similar clock speed.  Looks to me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like the Alpha is very economical, it all depends on what you are doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>99.9% of the people using computers would find the Athlon
<BR>
a much better buy for integer work. If your code is not
<BR>
that way, first I'd ask myself why, and second if there is
<BR>
absolutely no way to get Athlon to do the job, stick to
<BR>
Alphas.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Anyway, this a bit off topic so thats it for me on this topic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Seems to be perfectly on topic to me.
</EM><BR>
<P>Discussing Athlons in an Alpha forum is off topic.
