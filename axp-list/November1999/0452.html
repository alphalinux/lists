<P>
<EM>&gt; 	Frankly, even x86 doesn't do that by having IO system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	to access memory exceeding low-mem area (2GB ?) of such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	beasts.  The x86 doesn't have scatter-gather facilities.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>indeed.. the x86 does it by way of an intel cpu kludge. In contrast the
<BR>
Alpha should be able to do this cleanly by seperating dependancy of bus
<BR>
space to phys space.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 	Oh, such would lovely.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	But it would definitely need changes into used drivers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>it would, wouldn't it? I remember seeing a post on l-k from someone saying
<BR>
they were thinking of implementing scatter gather driver interface support,
<BR>
but i can't find it back and don't remember who.
<BR>
<P>the back-end scatter gather support on x86 would be pretty involved, but
<BR>
could be done very cleanly on alpha. be real nice to see it. Anyone thinking
<BR>
of doing it for 2.5?
<BR>
<P>regards,
<BR>
<P>paul jakma.
