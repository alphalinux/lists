<P><EM>&gt; On my UDB, I had a similar problem. It'd power on, but not bring up a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; console or even initialize the TGA adaptor. Of course.. my Multia had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been working for a couple years previous to this.. so.. I knew the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machine was at least functional. I found that the power connector on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the mainboard wasn't making good contact with the power supply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connector (wiggling the cables around a bit caused the machine to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spring to life for varying amounts of time). I've yet to fix this (I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; currently working on another project) but I imagine that either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cleaning those contacts real well or replacing them altogether would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably solve my problem. I imagine it might solve yours as well.
</EM><BR>
<P>My UDB ran for a couple months before it started doing the same thing...
<BR>
I went through two or three batteries before I realized what the problem
<BR>
really was...  At that point I sliced five of the cables, removed the
<BR>
contact, and spliced in another.  I haven't had one problem since :-)

<EM>&gt; Alternately, you may want to try and plug some different RAM into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machine. I know that's an expensive proposition, however, these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machines, in my experience, have been VERY picky regarding what kind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of RAM you put in it, and in what quantity you use. I believe that if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the machine isn't happy with the RAM it would also react in the way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you described.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Do all Alpha's require true parity SIMMS?  If not, and if the RAM he had
<BR>
installed came from a machine that didn't need them, that could be the
<BR>
problem as well.
