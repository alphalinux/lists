<P><EM>&gt; Greetings,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I recently acquired an (apparently) new an unused Multia from a co-worker.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; After many weeks, I had finally obtained enough components to get it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; working (memory, kbd, mouse, floppy, etc).  However, to my dismay, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appears it is fatally inoperable.  I'm hoping someone can suggest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am already intermediately familiar with several Alpha systems, and I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; acquainted with some of the peculiarities of the UDB (including the battery
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My system has 2 pair of working 8MB x36 SIMMS (pulled from my AS200) and a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; new battery.  It fails to boot.  Removing the battery/re-arranging the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memory makes no difference.  This is a VX40.  The symptom is that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system will power up (fans, CPU gets hot over time, etc), but the console
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never initializes.  The SROM LED on the back flashes hex E, indicating a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memory configuration error - or mainboard failure.  Since no memory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; combination I try (including no memory present) does not change this error
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; code, I am dreading the worst.  Is there any hope?  If not, where can I get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a replacement?  For the cost of the unit, I'd rather replace the entire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing (perhaps for a better Multia) than try to get a new mainboard.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Suggestions?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>On my UDB, I had a similar problem. It'd power on, but not bring up a
<BR>
console or even initialize the TGA adaptor. Of course.. my Multia had
<BR>
been working for a couple years previous to this.. so.. I knew the
<BR>
machine was at least functional. I found that the power connector on
<BR>
the mainboard wasn't making good contact with the power supply
<BR>
connector (wiggling the cables around a bit caused the machine to
<BR>
spring to life for varying amounts of time). I've yet to fix this (I'm
<BR>
currently working on another project) but I imagine that either
<BR>
cleaning those contacts real well or replacing them altogether would
<BR>
probably solve my problem. I imagine it might solve yours as well.
<BR>
<P>Alternately, you may want to try and plug some different RAM into the
<BR>
machine. I know that's an expensive proposition, however, these
<BR>
machines, in my experience, have been VERY picky regarding what kind
<BR>
of RAM you put in it, and in what quantity you use. I believe that if
<BR>
the machine isn't happy with the RAM it would also react in the way
<BR>
you described.
<BR>
<P>Otherwise.. it seems Starship Computers
<BR>
(<A HREF="http://www.starshipcorp.com/starshipcomputers/">http://www.starshipcorp.com/starshipcomputers/</A>) still sells OEM parts
<BR>
for the Multia (albeit at insane prices). You may want to try them for
<BR>
a replacement mainboard.
