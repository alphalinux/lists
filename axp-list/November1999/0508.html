<P>
<EM>&gt; From what I learned recently &quot;features&quot; in core chipsets on existing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boards (read &quot;logic bugs&quot;) makes it very unlikely that this can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doable on anything below ev6.  Machines which currently are showing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up should be fine but LXes or UXes are out.  None of these 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; older designs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was actually ever officially qualified to run with more than 1.5 GB
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of RAM.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>perhaps those boards aren't qualified. but the chipset, 21172, 21174
<BR>
certainly is. IIRC the same same chipsets are used in DEC ev5 servers which
<BR>
are qualified for 2GB+.
<BR>
<P>(need to trawl website if specific examples are needed).
