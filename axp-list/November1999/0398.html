<P>
I want to update everyone in the same vein...
<BR>
<P>I've achieved new heights of stability by statically linking the sound
<BR>
drivers and *not* using modules.  I still have to use the plug and play
<BR>
driver, which complains of irq conflicts on boot, but my sound card wouldn't
<BR>
be properly initialized without it.
<BR>
<P>I've been up for 3 1/2 days with constant sound use, and I'm listening to
<BR>
mp3's right now as I type this!
<BR>
<P>Why is the system so unstable when the sound drivers are built as modules???
<BR>
I don't know.  But if this keeps up, I'll be very happy!
<BR>
<P>Kurt, I'm curious...  Were you filling all your RAM slots when you were using
<BR>
384MB?  It's possible that if you weren't and had your motherboard jumpered
<BR>
for 256-bit memory accesses, that your system was screwing up.
<BR>
I'm pretty sure that the 256-bit memory access can only be used if you fill
<BR>
*all* the RAM slots.  I could be wrong, but it's a thought.
<BR>
I have 64MB ( 4 X 4MBx36 ) and I have my board jumpered for 128-bit accesses.
<BR>
