<EM>&gt; &gt; You're right. But from what you wrote , it looks as if these people are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a long way from porting to Linux Alpha , as there is not yet a version
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for Intel Linux available yet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; There's no rules against talking about vapourware (tm) either.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not necessarily. I have talked to them numerous times on the subject. As far
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as being a long way off, they asked to see if people were interested. If they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get no response, then it is a dead issue. Sad because their software is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even all that expensive considering what it does. And they are one of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; VERY FEW who even supported Alpha at all.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know why people need to port from Linux/Intel to other
<BR>
architectures all the time. They should write real legal code from the
<BR>
start, particularly for any high level apps. Then it is a matter of
<BR>
letting the compiler handle the rest. Non open source code seems to have
<BR>
this problem. Alpha has to be &quot;popular&quot; for people to be bothered to do a
<BR>
port to it. It seems that porting to Alpha is just another way of saying
<BR>
&quot;we're cleaning up our code&quot;. :)
<BR>
<P>Anyway, we should always support apps like this being ported to linux. I
<BR>
probably wont use it, I havent even heard of it before but at least it
<BR>
gives choice on the matter and would probably motivate someone to do an
<BR>
open sourced one.
