<P><EM>&gt; &gt; What architecture?  I couldn't use Redhat's install at all on my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ES40s.  I had to roll my own on a Miata and net-boot the ES40s from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that, configure the local disk, then rpm --root install all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; packages onto the ES40s.  I then install my own kernel (a 2.2.10
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; derived kernel) onto the local disk and did reboot to boot off the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; local drive.  After the first one was working I made a tarball of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; FS on the local drive and just unpacked that on the rest of the nodes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on my cluster.  As for the Redhat install, it failed intermittently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; during the install process.  It had a really hard time with fdisk.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; udb. i  can't seem to select individual packages to install... 
</EM><BR>
<P>Now, you don't mention which version this is but I'm assuming 6.0? There's
<BR>
a problem with the installer image in 6.0 that causes it to sig 11 when
<BR>
selecting individual packages.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; why is redhat so annoying? I mean I select networking utilities and kernel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; development... but i can't select individual packages without having it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dump with signal 11.. so .. all i want is a f***ing kernel with networking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; utilities and kernel source .. all  i need. i don't need X utilities. I DO NOT NEED GNOME.. wtf is up with redhat? is it gnome software, not redhat software? why do they have to install gnome and kde crap by default. it's taken me 3 days to get this alpha working and it's still not working. redhat on an alpha is no longer cost efficient, i'm just going to go buy a router
</EM><BR>
<P>Calm down, the sig 11 thing has been around since almost day one. Most of
<BR>
the problems with 6.0 are listed in the errata.

<BR>
<P>From there you can get the updated ramdisk that sure cure the sig11
<BR>
problem. 
<BR>
<P>Yes, RedHat can be annoying, but we all make mistakes and don't think they
<BR>
put the sig 11 bug in there just to annoy us!
