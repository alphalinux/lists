<EM>&gt; &gt; Note this, it will come in useful later.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, lets do that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the Athlon would have a peak performance of 2GFLOPS at 500MHZ, Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Since I was comparing integer performance with x86 chips I don't see why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you should be bringing up fp performance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If it's integer performance, Athlons will do better against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha than they do with FP. Specint95_base on an Athlon 600 is 27.5.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Specint95 on Alpha 21164 600 is 18.4. There is no 600MHZ 21264
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so I can't quote it's performance. The 466MHZ 21264 Specint95 is 24.6
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the 667MHZ 21264 is 37.5. Note this is all done using compilers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no hand coded ASM allowed.
</EM><BR>
<P>No hand coded ASM here, I'm just using a basic C program written
<BR>
originally on my old 486/33 without any modifications for the Alpha, using
<BR>
egcs the code is twice as fast as the same code running on a PII.  It is
<BR>
my understanding that the Athlon is faster than a PII but not by a factor
<BR>
of two.  With ccc the code performs even better, I suggest you try running
<BR>
some actual real world programs you might be using for comparison.  I
<BR>
have yet to use an x86 system that didn't feel sluggish by comparison to
<BR>
an Alpha.  It may be that the benchmark codes are doing the Alpha a
<BR>
disservice, not unheard of.  As I said, if you really want performance
<BR>
then you need to look at the architecture and code for it.  Just writing
<BR>
sloppy C and expecting the compiler to fix any problems is not the right
<BR>
attitude.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; can be expected to be faster again clock for clock, I heard 2-2.5x faster
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; than a '164.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The Athlon is capable of nine operations per clock, 3 integer,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3 address, and 3 FP. The Specint95 indicates they did something 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right.
</EM><BR>
<P>Possibly, but I still find it unlikely that the Athlon will be faster than
<BR>
a '164 clock for clock, let alone a '264 based on my experience.  I simply
<BR>
don't believe benchmarks, the best benchmark is your own code.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; will perform very well there maybe with a little massaging to fit the code
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to the architecture a bit better.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Must be highly unusual code. I suppose you're doing cryptography
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or some such if it's all integer based work.
</EM><BR>
<P>Biological sequence analysis code.  One version written in simple C (64
<BR>
bit clean) which compiles and runs on anything, the other is written
<BR>
specifically to the 64 bit architecture and needs true 64 bit longs to
<BR>
work and that goes like mad.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; pair) you would need 20 x86 boxes of similar clock speed.  Looks to me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; like the Alpha is very economical, it all depends on what you are doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 99.9% of the people using computers would find the Athlon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a much better buy for integer work. If your code is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that way, first I'd ask myself why, and second if there is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; absolutely no way to get Athlon to do the job, stick to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alphas.
</EM><BR>
<P>I know why thankyou very much.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, this a bit off topic so thats it for me on this topic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Seems to be perfectly on topic to me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Discussing Athlons in an Alpha forum is off topic.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why?  People are claiming Athlons are fantastically fast when what is
<BR>
actually the case is that they are fantastically fast for x86 processors.
<BR>
If you're going to badmouth Alpha you need to know that there are cases
<BR>
which allow an Alpha to far outstrip an x86 processor.  If this was just
<BR>
about Athlons then I would agree with you.
