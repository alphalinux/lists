<P>
I realize this is more a question for Metrolink support, but I'm still
<BR>
waiting for a response from them...
<BR>
<P>Has anyone here successfully gotten Metrolink's X server to run on Alpha
<BR>
Linux?  I have a generic Permedia2 card that I tried...  When I tried to
<BR>
run configX, it says that it's starting the server...  After thirty
<BR>
seconds of this, it drops me back to the unix prompt without ever having
<BR>
started the server.  When I try to start the server with &quot;Xmetro&quot;, I get
<BR>
a library error concerning &quot;__syscall&quot; (as I recall...  Unfortunately,
<BR>
I'm not in front of the machine at the moment)....  I then started the
<BR>
XFree86 server, ran configX, saved a Xmetroconfig file, and attempted to
<BR>
start the Metro-X server...  I got the same error...
<BR>
<P>If anyone has experienced this before, please let me know.  Any help
<BR>
would be appreciated.  Thanks.
<BR>
