<P>Not true.  There are plenty of 750 MHz chips available, but
<BR>
we have very few chip level customers, so modules are 
<BR>
more interesting.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 750MHz is easily done but:

<P>I don't know about easily, but we have done it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     with current chipsets a chip at 750MHz has a 75MHz memory bus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     clock.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     To get a reasonable gain in performance and overcome this memory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     speed issue:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;             a bigger cache is needed 8 MB ideally.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;             There is a problem with 8MB cache running reliably in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;             current CPU packages
</EM><BR>
<P>There is no reliability problem with the 8 MB cache.  The problem
<BR>
has been getting a predictable supply of parts, but now that we've
<BR>
switched vendors I think that problem is solved.  Having said that, we
<BR>
have had 750 MHz 8 MB Slot Bs in customer's hands for some time,
<BR>
just not as many of them as we'd like...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;              Cache on SlotB runs at CPU clockrate, I believe.
</EM><BR>
<P>The cache speed is variable and set by a divisor.  I can
<BR>
guarantee that it's not running at 750 MHz with today's
<BR>
technology!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In simple terms: If API or Compaq shipped a 750 with the same cache
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other design details as the 667, it would not be much ( if any)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; faster, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; depending on which benchmark you ran.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is misleading.  Of course everything depends on the application,
<BR>
(as does everything else in the real world), but a 750 MHz UP2000 is
<BR>
faster than a 667 MHz UP2000 for most tasks.
<BR>
<P>As is typical, for this type of thing, there are three cases:
<BR>
<P>1. Application fits in cache for both systems - Performance
<BR>
scales with processor speed.
<BR>
<P>2. Application working set fits in 8 MB, but not 4 MB - Application
<BR>
scales superlinearly, benefiting from not only increased processor
<BR>
speed, but also faster memory access from L2 instead of
<BR>
main memory.
<BR>
<P>3. Application working set is much bigger than 8 MB - Performance
<BR>
is hurt by slower memory bus (to the degree that this isn't
<BR>
masked by larger L2 and out-of-order execution)
<BR>
<P>As with everything else, you need to pick the configuration which
<BR>
is appropriate to your application, but there are many applications
<BR>
which will benefit from 750 MHz UP2000s.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; We are now being told that nothing faster than 667 will ship in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; near future.
</EM><BR>
<P>You should check back with your reseller after the conference
<BR>
next week.
