<P>
I just wanted to apologize to both Greg and the AlphaLinux community for the waste
<BR>
of bandwidth and time that moronic rant about SPEC95.  As I have been corrected by
<BR>
multiple people, SPEC _is_ a benchmark consisting of &quot;real-world&quot; applications,
<BR>
albeit only a subset of them.  My intended point was that, while SPEC is indeed a
<BR>
good starting point, everyone should recognize that things have and continue to
<BR>
change.  As things continue to change, so do the benchmarks that are meant to model
<BR>
them in some fashion as SPEC has/will with SPEC2000.
<BR>
<P>As I quickly learned, Greg is much better versed in these areas than I (heck, he
<BR>
works at HPTI, what else do you want?).  Two lessons learned:  1) don't take
<BR>
arguments from the work day onto 'net mailing lists, and 2) don't try to type
<BR>
reasonably argued messages on Micro$oft systems at home without the benefit of
<BR>
coffee.  I'm going to go back under my locking hole now and hope that everyone can
<BR>
keep doing all those things they do without my moronic interference...*sigh*
<BR>
coffee......

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Very true.  The scary part of benchmarks like SPECint95 is that CPU
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; manufacturers may target benchmark performance specifically to get an edge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; over the competition, which does not necessarily benefit real-world code
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to the same degree.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; That's why SPECint and SPECfp are mostly composed of real-world codes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And that's why people that know better only consider SPEC95 as a _very_ relative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; measure of specific performance and not a good systemic view of any system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anyone who even talks of things in terms of SPEC95 as if it's a &quot;real-world&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; measure of actual performance just plain doesn't understand SPEC.  That's the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; biggest reason SPEC2000 is (hopefully) just around the corner.  There are a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plethora of reasons that SPEC95 is no longer relevant to modern computing loads,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but I won't get into them here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Suffice it to say that if you're going to look at SPEC marks, look at the full
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disclosure statement, and also try matching the specific elements of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; benchmark to the loads you're going to be running; the full disclosures are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quite often very enlightening.  SPEC is a tool, not the toolbox.
