<P>Well, out of curiosity, I downloaded, compiled, and installed the most
<BR>
recent beta of XFree86 4.0...  And in the process, I think I may have
<BR>
messed up the libraries...  3.3.5 would still work, but it might be
<BR>
affecting the Metro-X server.  Tonight, I'm going to scrub my drive,
<BR>
reinstall everything, and try again.
<BR>
<P>Actually, my primary purpose for getting Metro X is because I have an
<BR>
ATI Xpert98 card that just will not work with the XFree86 Mach64
<BR>
server.  My hope is to get it to work under Metro X.  It just happens
<BR>
that last night I had the Permedia2 card in my machine.
