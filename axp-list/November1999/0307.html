<P>
I can only say what does work for me...I've got an SB AWE32 running on
<BR>
an AlphaStation 3300, and an SB-16 running on a XLT-300. I've never
<BR>
had any problems using the kernel modules for these under 2.2.5 and
<BR>
I've definitely had my machines on for more than a few hours at a
<BR>
time. Did you check /proc/ioports, /proc/dma, /proc/interrupts for
<BR>
conflicts? 
<BR>
<P>I typically use EsoundD server to mix my audio...are you sending audio
<BR>
data to the devices directly?
<BR>

<P><P>I've got an SB AWE32 w/ 8MB of EMU RAM on it that locks up after a few
<BR>
hours.... noticed the problem with kernel 2.2.12 and 2.2.13 (which was my
<BR>
u/g from RedHat's 2.2.5-22 kernel)
<BR>
<P>Typically what happens with me is that all audio stops from the card... MIDI
<BR>
still runs fine...
<BR>
I can init 1 the machine and unload/load the modules again only to get the
<BR>
same junk. (no sound)
<BR>
<P>tried doing this a couple times once and managed to lock the system

<P>Yep, i've recorded up to 50LP's with my AWE64Gold and before that i did

a bunch with a PAS16.
<BR>

<P>I do

<P>I suppose your problem is specific for certain boards, my XL300 works fine
<BR>
with those cards (from 2.0.35 to 2.2.13). Just keep on hoping....
<BR>
<P>BTW you can have an ensonic card (1370/1371) for about $25. These PCI
<BR>
card have (very) good snr. and work fine with the kernel drivers.
