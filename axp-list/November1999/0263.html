<EM>&gt; &gt; don't believe benchmarks, the best benchmark is your own code.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Very true.  The scary part of benchmarks like SPECint95 is that CPU
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manufacturers may target benchmark performance specifically to get an edge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; over the competition, which does not necessarily benefit real-world code
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the same degree.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup.  As I've said, I have yet to see the x86 processors perform anything
<BR>
like as well as Alpha for my work regardless of what optimisations I might
<BR>
put into the compiler.  But, I use very little floating point.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Anyway, doesn't the Alpha have real advantages over x86 (besides clock
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speed, in which they are now neck-to-neck)?  My asm is a little rusty, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe the Alpha has far more GP registers, and can use registers for
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure does, if you really want some fun you can get into the asm (it's so
<BR>
nice on an Alpha, its like an high level language) and tune the living
<BR>
daylights out of the program core.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; parameter passing... does that mean it relies less on slow main memory or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cache?  Also, the Alpha traps unaligned memory accesses, and the x86
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ignores them by default... that means they are far more likely to be fixed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on Alpha than on x86, even though they still carry a penalty.  I'm sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there are other differences that I can't think of right now.
</EM><BR>
<P>Indeed.  Other points to remember when dealing with any processor is
<BR>
maximizing your cache usage, try and keep your memory accesses nice and
<BR>
linear so that the cache won't be being filled with lots of data you
<BR>
won't be using (O'Reilly has a nice book on high performance computing
<BR>
which goes into this in detail).  x86 has such a feeble amount of cache
<BR>
that for anything that is seriously compute intensive and that uses the
<BR>
cache well on an Alpha you are really going to see some rewards.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I write business software.  I don't need fp performance.  Typical business
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software really isn't heavy integer processing, as some others have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; claimed.  Rather it is very heavy on data processing, i.e. memory and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disk-intensive.  Large amounts of RAM are common to exploit disk caching
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the fullest.  Large processor cache helps too.  Any tricks to avoid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memory fetches and processor stalls are beneficial.  The importantance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of clock speed diminishes as much processor time is spent waiting for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memory or bus.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, actually sounds pretty similar to our code although we actually use
<BR>
very little physical RAM (1MB) and the algorithm is slow enough that even
<BR>
an IDE disc can keep up.  More than anything else I think this is why our
<BR>
code behaves so well on the Alpha.  Plus we use every register we can get
<BR>
our hands on.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The Alpha seems to cope well.  Most of our software I've tested on Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; performs as well as or better than the x86 version (both compiled with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gcc).  I realize I don't have the latest and fastest PIII, but then I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't have a 264 either... I guess I'm working with the previous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generation of both architectures.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ditto here although we are negotiating the price on a UP2000 with single
<BR>
processor at the moment to add to our cluster of '164s.
<BR>
<P>Basically though, if your code is plain 32 bit and compact so it uses the
<BR>
cache well the '164 Alpha is able to outperform clock for clock its x86
<BR>
rivals.  Also, if you can get the dual instruction pipeline running
<BR>
nicely on the Alpha (add a few no-ops here and there to stop it stalling)
<BR>
you can bump the speed up again.  Anything you need to do in 64 bits is
<BR>
going to be much faster and if you can do SIMD in the 64 bit word as we do
<BR>
then you can slaughter x86.  This completely ignores FP as I don't use it
<BR>
by and large.
<BR>
<P>Want a comparison?  If I run our Smith/Waterman algorithm on an Intel PII
<BR>
400Mhz box against a database it will take around 15 mins to complete a
<BR>
database search.  The same algorithm (not the same program since it won't
<BR>
run in less than 64 bits) will complete the task on a 533 '164 in less
<BR>
than 48 seconds.  Hopefully if we get a UP2000 box we can do it even
<BR>
quicker.
