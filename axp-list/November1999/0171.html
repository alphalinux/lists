Could you really use a noncommercial-unix? It's seems to be similar to what 
<BR>
sun is doing, free (or cheap) unix for non-commercial use. It's great if 
<BR>
you work for a university or non-profit organization. Linux or freeBSD 
<BR>
still seems the way to go if you want a cheap (free) unix-like software 
<BR>
solution. This program is better than earlier in the year when I wanted to 
<BR>
upgrade osf on my alpha and compaq wanted to charge me $8,000 for the 
<BR>
software alone. The best thing about linux is that it has driven down the 
<BR>
prices of unix boxes, now compaq/sun just have to figure out that they need 
<BR>
to offer a cheap commercial unix software solution. Don't offer me a cheap 
<BR>
non-commercial unix, offer me a cheap commercial unix, slightly more 
<BR>
expensive than redhat, but not at the gouging rates they use to be able to 
<BR>
get before linux became popular.
<BR>
just my personal rant,
<BR>
