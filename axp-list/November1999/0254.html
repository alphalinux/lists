Hello,
<BR>
<P>I'd like it if this could find it's way to whoever is in charge of the Red
<BR>
Hat distributions for various alpha platforms.
<BR>
<P>You see I've been having problems getting MILO to run and the BOOT disk to
<BR>
be recognized.  There's another guy posting to the axp-list who is having a
<BR>
similiar problem with unrecognised file systems.
<BR>
<P>Basically from my point of view what has happened is this.  Whoever decided
<BR>
that there could be a generic boot disk for all the alpha systems was
<BR>
wrong.  With RH5.2 there is a seperate boot disk for all the different
<BR>
platforms and one ramdisk.  In RH6.0 there is a generic disk for the boot
<BR>
disk and another generic disk for the ramdisk.
<BR>
<P>This is WRONG. It doesn't work. Please somebody organise proper boot disks.  
<BR>
<P>I think one of the problems is some of the systems don't recognise the file
<BR>
system being used.  I don't have a linux box running at the moment so I
<BR>
can't even see what's on the Red Hat boot disk.  
<BR>
<P>Is there an official email address for send bug reports like this?  
<BR>
<P>Adam.
