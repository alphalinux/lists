Hi again,
<BR>
<P>I still am having a few problems with X on my XL266.
<BR>
The fixes mentioned earlier seem to work, that was to remove a line in
<BR>
XF86Config and add FontPath &quot;direct path to font dirs&quot;.  However I have
<BR>
had two X crashes since changing this line and after each of them the
<BR>
XF86Config reverted back to the original file????  
<BR>
<P>People mentioned something about downloading the &quot;RawHide&quot; xfs, and that
<BR>
it works better, where do I download it, does disabling the xfs cause any
<BR>
problems or adverse effect to X?
<BR>
<P>One last question, at this point I only know of one way to setup a
<BR>
monitor for X, that is using the &quot;text tool&quot;, (It is in one of the menus
<BR>
in Afterstep and Enlightenment), I just got a new monitor and am having a
<BR>
bit of trouble getting it to work in either 1024x768 or 1280x1024, the
<BR>
monitor is a LG 790SC and the manual is came with is a bit cryptic, which
<BR>
file do I edit to get it change to a mode other than 640x480??
<BR>
<P>Some stats for the monitor
<BR>
1024x768   hori freq   vert freq
<BR>
mode 1       48.363      60.004
<BR>
mode 2       68.677      84.997
<BR>
<P>1280x1024  hori freq   vert freq
<BR>
mode 1       63.974      60.013
<BR>
mode 2       91.146      85.024
<BR>
<P>I assume the rest of the information is not needed (total period, data
<BR>
period, blanking, polarity, etc) I have no clue if it is interlaced or
<BR>
not. Any suggestions
<BR>
<P>I apologise for being new to this all but, I tried looking for some
<BR>
answers on various pages but using lynx is a bit of a pain because all the
<BR>
the graphics people use. Nobody is designing text browsable pages these
<BR>
days.
<BR>
<P>thanks again
<BR>
