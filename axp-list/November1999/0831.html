<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You imply one thing, then imply another.  I'm confused.  Are you
<BR>
trying to set up a bunch of terminals tied to a single server, or a bunch of
<BR>
separate machines, or just one machine?  Have you already started this and
<BR>
run into a snag, or are you wondering what will (in general) work?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're looking to set up a single (or a few identical machines)
<BR>
basic party machine(s), the hard drive(s) shouldn't matter.  Nor should the
<BR>
video card(s) beyond a certain point -- it depends how well you'd like them
<BR>
to see stuff: a 2MB card will handle 1024x768 at 16-bit color (though I
<BR>
prefer 32-bit).  But this depends what you want to do: 32MB cards tend to be
<BR>
designed for 3D, making them good for games.

... who really should be doing more important things than describing party
<BR>
machines. ;-)

<P><EM>&gt; i'm trying to setup my house so that people can get on the net... visitors/people @ parties/etc..i'm too lazy to just turn them into xterms off of a server.. so i want them to just work.. mozilla seems like a no-go.. it works half of the time and barely will do anything.. looks like crap..

<EM>&gt; hardware wise, what should I do? can someone recommend a good fast hard drive? I guess i can put an ultra wide scsi 2 on the udb.. that should help a lot. i've got a  slow as heck seagate 1 gig scsi on it right now (it's a monster.. takes up 2 bays)..  and 64mb ram.. would it be noticeablly different if i put a faster ultra-wide 2 hard drive, maxed it out to 128mb ram? and what's a good graphics card for this? Is it worth putting a 16mb/32mb pci card in? will it be utilized?
