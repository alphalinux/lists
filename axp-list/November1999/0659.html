<P>
<EM>&gt; What architecture?  I couldn't use Redhat's install at all on my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ES40s.  I had to roll my own on a Miata and net-boot the ES40s from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that, configure the local disk, then rpm --root install all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; packages onto the ES40s.  I then install my own kernel (a 2.2.10
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; derived kernel) onto the local disk and did reboot to boot off the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; local drive.  After the first one was working I made a tarball of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; FS on the local drive and just unpacked that on the rest of the nodes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on my cluster.  As for the Redhat install, it failed intermittently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; during the install process.  It had a really hard time with fdisk.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>udb. i  can't seem to select individual packages to install... 
<BR>
<P>why is redhat so annoying? I mean I select networking utilities and kernel
<BR>
development... but i can't select individual packages without having it 
<BR>
dump with signal 11.. so .. all i want is a f***ing kernel with networking
<BR>
utilities and kernel source .. all  i need. i don't need X utilities. I DO NOT NEED GNOME.. wtf is up with redhat? is it gnome software, not redhat software? why do they have to install gnome and kde crap by default. it's taken me 3 days to get this alpha working and it's still not working. redhat on an alpha is no longer cost efficient, i'm just going to go buy a router
