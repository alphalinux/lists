<EM>&gt; &gt;From www.top500.org... what totally beats me is the

<EM>&gt; Hitachi machines.(SR8000/128) Hitachi has a few

<EM>&gt; supercomputers listed on top500... but the amazing

<EM>&gt; part is the CPU count (very low).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For example, #5 is a Hitachi machine with 128 CPUs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; while #34 is a 512 CPU AlphaServer SC. Or consider #6,

<EM>&gt; which is a Cray/SGI T3E900 with 1324 CPUs.

<EM>&gt; What are the Japanese making? Does anyone know

<EM>&gt; anything about these machines? I mean, if you do a

<EM>&gt; Hitachi CPUs is more powerful than 4 Alphas.

<P>The difference you are probably seeing is that the Hitachi machine
<BR>
(and the other Japanese machines) are vector based large scale SMP
<BR>
machines.  American companies have gone a different direction in
<BR>
super-computing recently by building MPP machines.  The Japanese have
<BR>
gone the route of optimizing SMP vector machines.  Here at LLNL we
<BR>
have found that the large scale SMP machines have quite a few
<BR>
limitations that make it so they don't scale as well (at least current
<BR>
versions, there are some that will fix these limitations in the next
<BR>
2-3 years).  MPP machines have a MUCH higher I/O throughput/CPU than
<BR>
their SMP counterparts.  The MPP machines also allow for finer
<BR>
scheduling granularity and resource allotment between jobs.  Of course,
<BR>
some applications are much more suited to a large-scale vector machine
<BR>
than for MPP machines, so there is a place for both types.
