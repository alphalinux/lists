<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	Don't know much about ISA on an alpha, but I remember somthing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the ISA system on x86 and DMA transfers.  There is this nice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; little option in the sound section to grab a chunk of mem for DMA and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hold it (but only when compiling the card in, no modules).  Somthing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about ISA DMA transfers and memory locations above 16MB causing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strange things to happen.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Speaking of which.. Most modern alpha's (at least 21172 chipset and up iirc)
<BR>
support programmable scatter-gather bus -&gt; phys address space windows. Using
<BR>
these would solve the ISA 16MB address space problem, ie we could map the
<BR>
16MB of contiguous ISA space to anywhere in physical space. We could even do
<BR>
it chunks, so the mapping wouldn't have to be contiguous. Same argument for
<BR>
the rest of PCI addr space.
<BR>
<P>Also might make 2GB+ RAM on alpha possible. The standard answer to &quot;how do i
<BR>
get more than 1GB to work with my PC server?&quot; was always &quot;go get a proper
<BR>
64bit machine like an alpha&quot;.. Yet now x86 supports 4GB+ RAM and alpha
<BR>
doesn't!!!
<BR>
<P>Is anybody working on scatter-gather windows for Alpha? I guess this'd need
<BR>
some kind of uniform kernel scatter-gather support in addition to the alpha
<BR>
hardware specific stuff though... which is perhaps an issue for
<BR>
linux-kernel.
<BR>
