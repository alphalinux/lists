<P>
I have an interesting comparison..
<BR>
<P>At work I have three PCs.  One is a PII/350 running Red Hat 6, another is a
<BR>
PII/400 running BSDI, and the other is an Alpha 255 running Red Hat 6.  I'm
<BR>
not trying to smash any particular vendor, but I have evidence that doesn't
<BR>
make sense.  If I download themes from e.themes.org I *always* get around
<BR>
70kb - 80kb/sec (on a T1) per download under Linux.  With BSDI (and before
<BR>
that, FreeBSD) I get around 40kb/sec.  At first I thought it was a fluke,
<BR>
but it's been happening this way ever since day one of running *BSD.  The
<BR>
x86 boxes have identical AMD PCI 10/100 cards, all systems go to the same
<BR>
switch, run full duplex, and go through the same PIX firewall.
<BR>
<P>I was under the impression that the *BSD stack was superior to all
<BR>
others..is that for specific tasks only?  Why am I getting double the
<BR>
performance under Linux?  BTW, I have NT Workstation on a PIII/450 with
<BR>
256MB and just for kicks I downloaded the same files, but @ apprixmately
<BR>
30kb - 38kb/sec..
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
Mark
