<P><EM>&gt; I am currently setting up an ISP and I am debating on using Linux versus Unixware 7 or Tru64.  I have read articles from earlier in the year when the benchmarking test had NT out performing Linux as a web platform.  Have all the problems with the SMP support and TCP stack been corrected in Linux 6.1 to surpass NT, and can anyone give me their experiences with UW7 and TRU64 in a working environment.

<P>I have been running an ISP using Alpha linux systems for several years
<BR>
now. I also have a few True64 systems. From my point of view linux is well
<BR>
up to the task of being used for ISP use. I remember early on we were
<BR>
using DU for our most of our routing. I ended up having a problem with
<BR>
gated that the folks at DEC were unable to fix. At least with linux I can
<BR>
get the problem fixed. I may have to do it my self of get a consultant but
<BR>
I can get it fixed. With True64/UnixWare/Solaris/HUPX/AIX ... if you are
<BR>
not a Fortune 3 company you will not be able to afford real support.
<BR>
<P>We have a number of systems that have been up in excess of 300 days(that
<BR>
was the last time we did a major upgrade of the OS on a number of our
<BR>
systems and every body got rebooted.
<BR>
<P>Most all the various Unix systems are within 5-10% of each other in terms
<BR>
of performance given the same hardware. This is a general statement and
<BR>
your milage may vary. So If the licencing cost of the OS is equal to the
<BR>
cost of the hardware you can have 2x the systems if you run linux. So
<BR>
unless the application has a specific requirement that can be satisfied by
<BR>
a specific OS on specific hardware linux will generaly win out on the
<BR>
price/performance scale.
