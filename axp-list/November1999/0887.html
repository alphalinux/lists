<EM>&gt; &gt; I think that between 6.0 and this

<EM>&gt; &gt; Rawhide, I have noticed a subtle difference in the way ext2 partitions

<EM>&gt; &gt; are formatted, with much fewer copies of the superblock being created
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; now. This seems to have broken both milo and aboot,

<EM>&gt; Are you using e2fsprogs-1.17 and partition from which you are booting

<EM>&gt; of e2fsprogs will format such partitions by default with 4K blocks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and sparse superblocks but there are options which allow to override
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these settings.  I am not aware of any version of Alpha boot utilities
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which would be able to handle a file system formatted that way.

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; If you are using milo and you have a FAT partition on your hard drive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you should be able to boot with a kernel on it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the one guy who asked, Red Hat Rawhide is the bleeding-edge, fly by
<BR>
the seat of your pants, development version of Red Hat for all three
<BR>
platforms. Available by FTP only as far as I know, and changing almost
<BR>
daily, at <A HREF="ftp://rawhide.redhat.com/pub/rawhide.">ftp://rawhide.redhat.com/pub/rawhide.</A> Rawhide is definitely not
<BR>
meant for production systems, and it's not even guaranteed to install, much
<BR>
less run. Since my Alpha is mostly a hobby-box, I thought I'd give it a
<BR>
shot.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I just did a custom install and installed everything. The version
<BR>
of e2fsprogs is 1.18-1.
<BR>
I currently have a 4meg (asked for 2) dos partition as hda1, and milo will
<BR>
boot from there. The problem comes after milo loads. Normally you can 'ls'
<BR>
the ext2 partitions from milo but with the 'sparse superblocks' as you call
<BR>
them way you get is a bunch of lines of useless garbage, as though milo is
<BR>
looking at a data sector and trying to interpret  it as a directory. when
<BR>
you tell milo to boot the kernel, ie:  MILO&gt; boot hda2:/boot/vmlinuz
<BR>
root=/dev/hda2 I am told that milo failed to load the kernel. I can (and
<BR>
currently do) use MILO&gt; boot fd0:/vmlinux.gz root=/dev/hda2 and boot off
<BR>
the floppy. Once an actual kernel is loaded, the ext2 partitions can be
<BR>
accessed normally.
<BR>
Aboot exhibits the same problem I think, although I of course can't try an
<BR>
'ls' on the partition. After running &quot;/sbin/swriteboot /dev/hda1
<BR>
/boot/bootlx&quot; during the install to install aboot, and setting my SRM
<BR>
variables appropriately, the system will find a valid bootblock, but fail
<BR>
when it tries to find the kernel at 2/boot/vmlinux-2.2.12-42. I will be
<BR>
investigating an option I once heard of where you can write aboot and the
<BR>
kernel together at once to the type 'boot' partition so that they are
<BR>
loaded in the same disk read. That may work, but it seemed unnecessarily
<BR>
difficult whe I first heard of it. An updated version would be better.
