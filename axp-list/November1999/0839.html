<P>
Some of you might have heard of Satori Paint. It is one of the best paint programs
<BR>
around, and one of the few that were available for Alpha NT.
<BR>
<P>Mark Lister from SatoriPaint posted this to the Satori Mailing List. I have talked to
<BR>
Mark a couple of times regarding Linux and I am taking this message from him as a
<BR>
possible good sign.
<BR>
<P>Please take the time and send them feedback. This program is well worth
<BR>
having.............
<BR>
<P><P>Dear Linux/MacOS/BeOS supporters,
<BR>
<P>We have had many earlier requests to develop Satori versions for Linux, MacOSX and/or
<BR>
BeOS.  The most popular request is currenty for MacOSX version.
<BR>
<P>If you would like Satori to be available for any one of these operating systems then we
<BR>
would welcome your feedback and encouragement. You could complete an independent survey
<BR>
as suggested by Michael Mannall (below), email sales@satoripaint.com or vote directly
<BR>
by emailing the appropriate address below. It will be interesting to see if the
<BR>
popularitry of a Linux version exceeds MacOSX.
<BR>
<P>Linux@satoripaint.com
<BR>
MacOS@satoripaint.com
<BR>
BeOS@satoripaint.com
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Now would be a good time for them to get in when there is little competition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from others, giving them a head start on what will possibly (hopefully) be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the next main OS.
</EM><BR>
<P>You might be surprised to hear that we are ready to start porting Satori to MacOSX,
<BR>
Linux or BeOS but are not prepared to make a commitment alone to a new version.
<BR>
However, we would be willing to complete this work as a develoment priority provided
<BR>
that we are able to source a software publisher and/or investor that is willing to fund
<BR>
the porting and help support the marketing and distribution activities.
<BR>
<P>If there is indeed an early market opportunity for a new Satori version then this
<BR>
invitation should generate many applicants, especially given the likely high potential
<BR>
return on investment.
<BR>
<P>We are a small independent developer and have already privately invested $1.6M and
<BR>
eight years of R &amp; D in Satori 2D gaphics technology. The investment required to
<BR>
sponsor new versions is relatively insignificant and we welcome any interest in this
<BR>
new business opportunity.
<BR>
<P>If you would like to find out more about investing in a Satori version for Linux, BeOS
<BR>
or MacOSX and/or would like to nominate a suitable investor/publisher then please email
<BR>
me directly.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
