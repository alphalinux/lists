<EM>&gt; I spoke too soon. After a week, the SCSI chain finally gave me trouble
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; again. When it failed, all the devices on the chain started reporting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; errors, the the bus was reset, and that's the last message on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; screen.
</EM><BR>
<P>For review, this system is a PC164 w/ an AHA2940UW, two SCSI hard disks,
<BR>
and a SCSI combination CD-ROM/Phasewriter. The kernel is 2.2.13. I had
<BR>
been getting regular hangs that I finally tracked down to SCSI problems.
<BR>
I replaced what appeared to be a malfunctioning SCSI drive, and pulled
<BR>
the PD drive off the chain. This improved matters, but didn't fix it.
<BR>
SCSI errors (that resulted in a hung computer) persisted.
<BR>
<P>I replaced the AHA2940UW with an ITI3140U and I can now say with confidence
<BR>
that the computer lockups are gone. I've worked the machine over harder
<BR>
then usual, and it has outlasted the best stretch I got out of the Adaptec
<BR>
card.
<BR>
<P>I don't know if it is a funky card, a systematically funky product, or
<BR>
a funky driver, but I doubt the first as my switch to Intraserver was
<BR>
prompted by comments from other Linux/alpha users that removing the
<BR>
Adaptec card fixed lockup problems. I'm suspicious of the driver because
<BR>
it wasn't 'till the 2.1 series of kernels that I started having troubles,
<BR>
but then again, there seemed to be honest SCSI chain errors written to
<BR>
the console.
<BR>
<P>Anyhow, whatever the cause, Intraserver gained a sale and an endorsement,
<BR>
and my alpha is working reliably now.
