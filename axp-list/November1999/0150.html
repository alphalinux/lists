Note this, it will come in useful later.

<P><EM>&gt; the Athlon would have a peak performance of 2GFLOPS at 500MHZ, Alpha
</EM><BR>
<P>Since I was comparing integer performance with x86 chips I don't see why
<BR>
you should be bringing up fp performance.
<BR>
<P>The point is that at the present moment in time a basic dual pipeline
<BR>
21164A processor at 600 Mhz is more than twice as quick as a 400Mhz PII
<BR>
running purely integer code compiled with egcs on both machines.  Using
<BR>
ccc makes the Alpha execute the same code around 30% quicker again.  The
<BR>
'264 has four integer pipelines and features to make it better able to use
<BR>
those to full effect (out of order execution for instance) and as such it
<BR>
can be expected to be faster again clock for clock, I heard 2-2.5x faster
<BR>
than a '164.
<BR>
<P>For the work I am involved in the extra benefits of the long word make a
<BR>
'164 10x quicker than an x86 processor clock for clock which makes them
<BR>
very economical.  I haven't tried the code on a '264 but I expect the code
<BR>
will perform very well there maybe with a little massaging to fit the code
<BR>
to the architecture a bit better.
<BR>
<P>What is different about the way we code here is that pour over the data
<BR>
sheets on the architecture and write our code accordingly, this behaviour
<BR>
has gained us a performance benefit of a factor of three from when we
<BR>
first moved our code from SGI R10000 to Alpha.  We are now working on an
<BR>
MPI version of the code and running test jobs on a pair of '164s we have
<BR>
sitting here and the results are very encouraging.  To get the same
<BR>
performance as these two '164 boxes (that cost us around $4000US for the
<BR>
pair) you would need 20 x86 boxes of similar clock speed.  Looks to me
<BR>
like the Alpha is very economical, it all depends on what you are doing
<BR>
with them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Anyway, this a bit off topic so thats it for me on this topic.
</EM><BR>
<P>Seems to be perfectly on topic to me.
