<P>
Playing tag?
<BR>
<P>I have an x86 Solaris box (Solaris 7) that I have had as home 
<BR>
server for quite some time (since it was Solaris 2.4).  I have 
<BR>
had absolutely NO complaints from it or about it - except that
<BR>
is was a royal pain to configure.  NONE of the default programs
<BR>
that you need to do decent webservice were included, nor was
<BR>
even a rudimentary compiler.  Myself, I used it because it was
<BR>
so difficult and I wanted a thourough knowledge of the programs
<BR>
and configs.  It operates flawlessly under load, with uptimes 
<BR>
of several months being extremely common (the only time I have
<BR>
to reboot it is when the internal modem goes nuts - part of the
<BR>
x86 trash that I haven't had the gumption to replace).
<BR>
<P>If I was (still) in a work environment with the appropriate software 
<BR>
and hardware support, I would take a Sun Sparc over an x86 
<BR>
anything anytime.  But that's not real life.  Sun software costs.  A lot.
<BR>
I have not had the same results with linux.  When a sparc hoses
<BR>
a mainboard, you just ate a sparc.  When my linux box eats a 
<BR>
mainboard, I fork over a good $90 for a decent motherboard,
<BR>
install, reboot and let the kernel figure out the new settings.
<BR>
<P>As part of it's job description, a typical web server is constantly
<BR>
undergoing updates and revisions.  The ability to drop in the
<BR>
latest P-III 600mhz into a previous P-133 and have it work is
<BR>
a real strong arguement for a flexible OS with a hardware and
<BR>
software upgrade path.  And as much as I like Solaris, it is not
<BR>
that OS.  Linux is.

<EM>&gt; And there is another issue there about the stability.  Lets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; face it, 95% of PC hardware is trash.  With a proper build you can get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the same hardware stability as a SUN, but it normally requires a fair
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bit of effort in parts choice and assembly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Personally, I have never had a production Linux box go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; down/have issues that were not directly related to me or the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environment (wrong command line, 140F room toasts a drive, etc).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Apples to apples would bring Solaris x86 into play, and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a diff story than Solaris Sparc.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Hell, I work at an ISP and we use nothing BUT Linux (x86)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; servers.  I also have worked with the other major OS's (Tru64,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; HPUX, Sun/Solaris, AIX, ad naseum), and I have found that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Linux is emminently more configurable than any of the others.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It is not as rock solid as Sun is, but I have found the built-in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; functionality (gcc, apache, working sendmail, pop, named)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to more than offset any advantages Sun might have.  In addition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to the fact that any security problems you have are fixed in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; matter of hours or days, not weeks or months.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Plus, frankly, it's free.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; These are strong advantages I'd be hard-pressed to overlook
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or ignore.
