<P><EM>&gt; I'm going out on a limb:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is anyone on this list using an ISA sound card (like a SB16 PnP) which *isn't*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; locking up their whole machine with frequent use?
</EM><BR>
<P>I have an XL300 with an ISA SB16Val that works perfectly. I'm running Raw
<BR>
Hide 103199 and 2.2.13, but it was OK with RH6.0 (well, as good as
<BR>
anything was with RH6.0 --yuck.)
<BR>
<P>However, I had so many lockups with my PC164 that I really couldn't
<BR>
isolate the sound card as a problem. It locked up with or without it. This
<BR>
was with RH6.0 or Raw Hide. I ended up putting the damn thing in a corner
<BR>
and forgetting about it for a while. BTW, the PC164 ran fine with DU
<BR>
4.0F, and I swapped every piece of hardware in the system, so I doubt a
<BR>
hardware problem. It would lock up under linux when starting X, or when
<BR>
using the ethernet card, or when playing a sound. Something with IO?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Does anyone CARE???
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, there are some of us that do. :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Are there any kernel developers on this list who have even the foggiest clue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as to why this is happening?  This is affecting other people too, not just me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And it's next to impossible to troubleshoot, since it doesn't cause an actual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; panic.  Instead, the whole machine freezes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Does anyone at RedHat care this is happening?
</EM><BR>
<P>Has anyone at RedHat _seen_ these problems, or are they just holding their
<BR>
tongue?
