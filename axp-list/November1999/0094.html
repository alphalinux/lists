The new chipset for the coppermine processors has not been released.  It is not
<BR>
expected out for several more months.  The Athlon 500 or 550 outperformed the
<BR>
PIII 600 in everybenchmark that Tomshardware could test it on.  Double Data Rate
<BR>
SDRAM is the stuff that would make it appear that you are running on a 200MHz
<BR>
bus, when in reality it would still be the 100MHz bus, but with data being moved
<BR>
on both the rise and fall of the clock.  I don't hate Intel.  In fact my dad
<BR>
works for them, but why pay more for a cpu that doesn't perform as well.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Not all the coppermines are at 133MHz bus.  I believe that the first of them is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the 733MHz CPU and it is still beaten by the Athlon in everything, but the quake
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; test benchmark.  Check out Toms Hardware to see the benchmarks.  To make it more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; interesting the results are with the non-existent i820 chipset.  Until that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; released you won't get the results seen.  One of the more interesting things is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that the rumor about the Athlon is that it can do 200MHz bus.  It can accomplish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; this by using both the up and down stroke of the clock.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; With Coppermine only slightly slower at a given clock rate,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there is little incentive to buy Athlon. (except those folks who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; despise Intel)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Intel introduced the 840 chipset with the new cpus and that does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support high performance memory. I just looked at it's specs and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it is capable of a maximum of 3.2GB/sec, but I suspect a single
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cpu will get no more than 1.6GB/sec since it uses two RDRAM channels.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That chipset looks pricey though. I also read there were MB
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; makers that were going to release 820 based boards but only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; put two memory slots on it to keep from triggering the bug in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the chipset.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Athlon MB manuals state they support double data rate SDRAM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (DDR SDRAM??) but I haven't found anyone who makes them to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; try it out. I have Athlons for test systems but am currently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; running PC100 SDRAM. They are definitely faster than older
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; PII/PIII at the same clock rate.
