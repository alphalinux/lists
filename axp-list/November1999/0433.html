<EM>&gt; I've achieved new heights of stability by statically linking the sound
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drivers and *not* using modules.  I still have to use the plug and play
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; driver, which complains of irq conflicts on boot, but my sound card wouldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be properly initialized without it.

<EM>&gt; I've been up for 3 1/2 days with constant sound use, and I'm listening to

<EM>&gt; mp3's right now as I type this!

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; Why is the system so unstable when the sound drivers are built as modules???
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't know.  But if this keeps up, I'll be very happy!

<EM>&gt; Kurt, I'm curious...  Were you filling all your RAM slots when you were using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 384MB?  It's possible that if you weren't and had your motherboard jumpered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for 256-bit memory accesses, that your system was screwing up.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm pretty sure that the 256-bit memory access can only be used if you fill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *all* the RAM slots.  I could be wrong, but it's a thought.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have 64MB ( 4 X 4MBx36 ) and I have my board jumpered for 128-bit accesses.

<P><P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't know much about ISA on an alpha, but I remember somthing
<BR>
about the ISA system on x86 and DMA transfers.  There is this nice
<BR>
little option in the sound section to grab a chunk of mem for DMA and
<BR>
hold it (but only when compiling the card in, no modules).  Somthing
<BR>
about ISA DMA transfers and memory locations above 16MB causing
<BR>
strange things to happen.
<BR>
<P>When loading a module, you pretty much get stuck with what is avail,
<BR>
and this could cause strange problems depending on what was happening
<BR>
when the system booted.
