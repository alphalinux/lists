Hi...
<BR>
<P>Sorry.. it has been a long time since I promised to release the Milo v2.2
<BR>
sources. Unluckily I was quite busy with university and other work in the past
<BR>
weeks so I didn't have the time to work on MILO anymore.
<BR>
<P>This version is based on the Milo-2.0.35-c5.3 sources of Nikita Schmidt
<BR>
&lt;cetus@snowball.ucd.ie&gt;, which are available on <A HREF="ftp://genie.ucd.ie/pub/alpha/milo/">ftp://genie.ucd.ie/pub/alpha/milo/</A>
<BR>
Since major changes were neccessary, I won't release a patchfile.
<BR>
<P>This version is working on a Ruffian. To compile it, you have to build a
<BR>
platform specific kernel for the Ruffian hardware and then a specific Milo.
<BR>
Please note: These sources are currently only working/tested on Ruffian. 
<BR>
I built milo successfully against Kernel 2.2.12.
<BR>
I think you need binutils older than 2.9.1.0.23 (I used 2.9.1.0.19) to build
<BR>
a working Milo. Something changed with the binary format since then and milo
<BR>
still assumes the old format.
<BR>
It worked for me using either egcs 1.1.2 or gcc 2.95.x.. other compilers were
<BR>
untested.
<BR>
As I didn't have the time to test how it behaves on a Redhat box, I only used a
<BR>
SuSE box as build system, but I guess you won't need lots or even any changes.
<BR>
<P>I was not able to get Milo 2.2 up and running for an 164LX board,but fixing this
<BR>
may be trivial.
<BR>
<P>The URL to get the Sources is:
