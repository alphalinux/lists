<P><EM>&gt; Hi,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   I'm looking for a better graphics card for my Alpha (I currently have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Matrox Millenium 2 with 4MB).  Looking in one of my local PC dealers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (www.microdirect.co.uk) I see they are offering a 'Creative Blaster Savage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4 32MB Retail PCI' (Based on the S3 Savage chip) and a '3Dfx Voodoo 3 2000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 16MB PCI'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>As I recall, the Savage 4 chip is *only* supported on x86 Linux systems...
<BR>
As for the Voodoo 3 card,. this is from the XFree86 FAQ:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Support for some of the Voodoo boards has been added to the 3.3.5 release.
<BR>
The work of Daryll Strauss has been integrated in this release but you might
<BR>
want to directly check his server at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://glide.xxedgexx.com/3DfxRPMS_vb_glibc.html.">http://glide.xxedgexx.com/3DfxRPMS_vb_glibc.html.</A> &quot;
<BR>
<P>I personally haven't had any luck with either card in my Alpha with 3.3.5.
<BR>
I've also downloaded and compiled the most recent pre-4.0 release in case it
<BR>
had better support, but I haven't had any luck with that...
<BR>
<P>My best experience with video card on an Alpha is a Permedia2 card I have
<BR>
which worked flawlessly with the 3DLabs server.  I've also used an S3 Virge
<BR>
card with the SVGA server...
<BR>
<P>Good luck...  And if you do get one of those cards working, please let me
<BR>
know.  Thanks.
<BR>
<P>Adam Kirchhoff
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Is anyone aware of 2D support for either of these devices and any 3D
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support around the corner?  Any known Alpharisms?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (I'm wondering how long newish spec PCI video cards will be available with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AGP becoming more and more ingrained).
