<P>
hey all, me again.  the slow-moving saga of me vs. my as200's sound config
<BR>
continues.  the problem- i cannot play mp3s- mpg123 says it can't reset
<BR>
audio every time i try to play a file with it.  i've been assuming it was
<BR>
a problem of incorrect irq/dma assignment in the card config, so after
<BR>
going through the suggested combinations (e.g. 7,3 9,0 9,3) without
<BR>
success, i just started trying all of them- 7,0 7,1 7,3 9,0 9,1 and so on.
<BR>
some of the resulting kernels wouldn't boot, but all the ones that have
<BR>
produced the same effect- mpg123 doesn't work.  my /dev/sndstat currently
<BR>
says this:
<BR>
[root@grubby lene_marlin]# cat /dev/sndstat

[root@grubby lene_marlin]# 
<BR>
<P>when i cat /dev/audio, i get a stream of characters, like it's streaming
<BR>
to stdout.
<BR>
when i cat /dev/audio1, i get device not configured (not sure if that's
<BR>
right or not).
<BR>
when i cat /dev/dsp, i get nothing.
<BR>
and when i cat /dev/dsp1, i get device not configured (again not sure if
<BR>
that's right).
<BR>
<P>but then tonight i discover something, in looking through the man pages
<BR>
for mpg123.  i called it with -a /dev/audio and i got sound- no 'can't
<BR>
reset audio' or 'no supported rate found!', though the sound quality was
<BR>
very rough.  apparently /dev/dsp is the default device for my system, and
<BR>
i have a feeling that it is supposed to be that way.  but is this hope for
<BR>
me?  is it indeed an incorrect irq/dma config that's preventing /dev/dsp
<BR>
from working?  any ideas?  does output using /dev/audio result in poorer
<BR>
sound quality than with /dev/dsp?  and accordingly, if i call it with both
<BR>
-a /dev/audio and -w, will i get a worse quality .wav file?  
<BR>
it's all still a mystery to me.  can anyone shed any light?
<BR>
<P>as always, i thank you all very much for your help.
