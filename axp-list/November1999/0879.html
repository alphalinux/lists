Greetings to all,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am successfully (sorta) running the Red Hat Rawhide/Alpha I
<BR>
downloaded from the FTP site last Saturday. (11/20/1999) My hardware is
<BR>
a 164SX machine with IDE hard drives and a Matrox Mystique video card.
<BR>
The machine runs really nice after updating to the 2.2.13 kernel with
<BR>
the CY82C693 IDE patch. My only problem is that the kernel must be
<BR>
loaded from floppy. Neither aboot nor milo can read the ext2 filesystems
<BR>
corectly from the hard drive, but once the kernel is loaded the drives
<BR>
are accessible. It's not a problem with my compiled kernel, as  the
<BR>
stock kernel also has this problem. I think that between 6.0 and this
<BR>
Rawhide, I have noticed a subtle difference in the way ext2 partitions
<BR>
are formatted, with much fewer copies of the superblock being created
<BR>
now. This seems to have broken both milo and aboot, and could explain
<BR>
why Red Hat hasn't released 6.1 for Alpha yet. Has anyone any idea where
<BR>
to get an updated version of either aboot or milo (i'm not too picky,
<BR>
but I'd like both). I have tried to compile milo without success, but my
<BR>
talents don't include serious programming. Can the maintainers of both
<BR>
aboot and milo please patch these required programs and release
<BR>
something soon?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for letting me rant.
<BR>
<P>Chris Kloiber
