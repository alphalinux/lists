<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Note this, it will come in useful later.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Yes, lets do that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Athlon would have a peak performance of 2GFLOPS at 500MHZ, Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Since I was comparing integer performance with x86 chips I don't see why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; you should be bringing up fp performance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If it's integer performance, Athlons will do better against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Alpha than they do with FP. Specint95_base on an Athlon 600 is 27.5.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Specint95 on Alpha 21164 600 is 18.4. There is no 600MHZ 21264
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; so I can't quote it's performance. The 466MHZ 21264 Specint95 is 24.6
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and the 667MHZ 21264 is 37.5. Note this is all done using compilers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; no hand coded ASM allowed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No hand coded ASM here, I'm just using a basic C program written
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; originally on my old 486/33 without any modifications for the Alpha, using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; egcs the code is twice as fast as the same code running on a PII.  It is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my understanding that the Athlon is faster than a PII but not by a factor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of two.  With ccc the code performs even better, I suggest you try running
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some actual real world programs you might be using for comparison.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have yet to use an x86 system that didn't feel sluggish by comparison to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an Alpha.  It may be that the benchmark codes are doing the Alpha a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disservice, not unheard of.  As I said, if you really want performance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then you need to look at the architecture and code for it.  Just writing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sloppy C and expecting the compiler to fix any problems is not the right
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attitude.
</EM><BR>
<P>I own 5 21264's, 2 21164's, and 2 Athlons plus a few other systems. 
<BR>
I think I've got a fairly good understanding of their performance. 
<BR>
Athlons are as snappy as any of the Alphas when it comes to user 
<BR>
interaction with the system. In fact, they outperform the 21164's 
<BR>
for most things. My own codes track SPEC's performance ratios so 
<BR>
I'm inclined to believe the guys who did the tests know what they're 
<BR>
doing. Do keep in mind the people who handle SPEC for a company 
<BR>
are the ones who know what makes their processor run fast. I also 
<BR>
like Linpack as an indicator of double precision FP performance.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; can be expected to be faster again clock for clock, I heard 2-2.5x faster
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; than a '164.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The Athlon is capable of nine operations per clock, 3 integer,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 3 address, and 3 FP. The Specint95 indicates they did something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; right.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Possibly, but I still find it unlikely that the Athlon will be faster than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a '164 clock for clock, let alone a '264 based on my experience.  I simply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't believe benchmarks, the best benchmark is your own code.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>True. Mine track the SPEC marks as I mentioned. Not identical
<BR>
but no two codes would be. The trend matches.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; will perform very well there maybe with a little massaging to fit the code
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to the architecture a bit better.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Must be highly unusual code. I suppose you're doing cryptography
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or some such if it's all integer based work.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Biological sequence analysis code.  One version written in simple C (64
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bit clean) which compiles and runs on anything, the other is written
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specifically to the 64 bit architecture and needs true 64 bit longs to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work and that goes like mad.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; pair) you would need 20 x86 boxes of similar clock speed.  Looks to me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; like the Alpha is very economical, it all depends on what you are doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; with them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 99.9% of the people using computers would find the Athlon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a much better buy for integer work. If your code is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that way, first I'd ask myself why, and second if there is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; absolutely no way to get Athlon to do the job, stick to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Alphas.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I know why thankyou very much.
</EM><BR>
<P>Good. Then keep using Alphas if they make you happy.
<BR>
No one processor does everything right, Alpha or Athlon or Intel or MIPS or
<BR>
UltraSPARC or POWER3 or POWERPC or (put your favorite here) ....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, this a bit off topic so thats it for me on this topic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Seems to be perfectly on topic to me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Discussing Athlons in an Alpha forum is off topic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why?  People are claiming Athlons are fantastically fast when what is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually the case is that they are fantastically fast for x86 processors.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you're going to badmouth Alpha you need to know that there are cases
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which allow an Alpha to far outstrip an x86 processor. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;far&quot; is relative and without you putting your code on an Athlon, 
<BR>
its quite difficult to define. I have put my code on Athlon and
<BR>
various other platforms and I know what that means to me. 0.3 to
<BR>
0.5 times a 21264 at the same MHZ for Athlon.
<BR>
<P>I use processors for what they are good at. x86 architectures
<BR>
do integer work more economically, $ for $, than an Alpha does.
<BR>
<P>Alphas do FP work $ for $, about equal to x86. Alpha's main
<BR>
advantage is it puts lots of FP in a small package which, when
<BR>
you want to run large parallel problems, is a significant advantage
<BR>
in terms of space needed to house the systems. 64 bit is nice to
<BR>
have also.
