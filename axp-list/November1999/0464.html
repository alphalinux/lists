<EM>&gt; Speaking of which.. Most modern alpha's (at least 21172 chipset and up iirc)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support programmable scatter-gather bus -&gt; phys address space windows.
</EM><BR>
<P>From what I learned recently &quot;features&quot; in core chipsets on existing
<BR>
boards (read &quot;logic bugs&quot;) makes it very unlikely that this can be
<BR>
doable on anything below ev6.  Machines which currently are showing
<BR>
up should be fine but LXes or UXes are out.  None of these older designs
<BR>
was actually ever officially qualified to run with more than 1.5 GB
<BR>
of RAM.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also might make 2GB+ RAM on alpha possible. The standard answer to &quot;how do i
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get more than 1GB to work with my PC server?&quot; was always &quot;go get a proper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 64bit machine like an alpha&quot;.. Yet now x86 supports 4GB+ RAM and alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't!!!
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, it does and an alpha machine with over 4GB of memory running Linux
<BR>
already exists.  But this work (not mine :-) is still in early stages
<BR>
and a driver support is rather limited.  Still things will happen RSN.
<BR>
I dabbled a bit in a driver conversion really trying to understand what
<BR>
is required; it can be &quot;fun&quot; and still doable with that knowing a driver
<BR>
really well would be of a great help.
