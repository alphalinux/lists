Hello everybody,
<BR>
<P>Well after large amounts of time spent trying different versions of MILO
<BR>
and different boot disks from different distributions it's become apparent
<BR>
that maybe an investigation into availability of RAM for my MULTIA is in
<BR>
order.
<BR>
16 Meg just doesn't seem to be enough (and it would probably run like a
<BR>
sloth even if I Could install it).
<BR>
<P>First of all can somebody give me a quick technical description of what
<BR>
type of ram a Multia requires.  I've read that it's JEDEC 2 standard?
<BR>
<P>Second. Does anyone know where in Australia I can find 8, 16 or 32 Meg simms?
<BR>
<P>Third. If anyone wants to send me their 8 meg simms that are sitting in a
<BR>
drawer somewhere then email me and lets see what we can work out :)
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
<P>Adam Last.
