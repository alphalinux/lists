<P>
A week or so ago, I sent the attached query to the list and got
<BR>
zero response.  OK, maybe there's nobody technical here.  Or maybe
<BR>
everybody's busy.  If I get no response to this second try, I'll
<BR>
go find somewhere else to ask.
<BR>
<P>Basically, we've noticed that continuous disk I/O on an Alpha running
<BR>
stock RedHat 6.2 locks the system up.  No mouse movement, no keyboard
<BR>
response, no network activity except for answering pings.  When the
<BR>
long-running I/O completes, the system returns to normal.
<BR>
<P>I need to know if this is normal behavior and if there is anything
<BR>
I can do to improve the situation.  I am a long-time Unix admin and
<BR>
have been running Linux on Intel hardware since about the 0.95 days,
<BR>
but am new to Linux on Alpha hardware.  Any suggestions or pointers
<BR>
to which FM to R would be appreciated.  I am on the list, so you
<BR>
can reply to me or to the list as you see fit.
<BR>
<P>Thanks!

<P>Here's my previous message:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've recently come into possession of a Symbolics-branded XP1000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; box.  It's apparently a 500MHz Alpha with 512MB and a nice fast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SCSI disk.  It had some sort of lisp software loaded on top of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Tru64 Unix.  Being unfamiliar with the hardware, it was a bit of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; struggle, but the machine now runs RedHat 6.2.  At this point, it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still pretty much in its out-of-the-box condition.  In particular,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I haven't upgraded the 2.2.14 kernel.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One of my co-workers with an identical system was testing files
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;2Gb and noticed that the system appeared to lock up during large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; file copies.  I tried &quot;cp /dev/zero /local/junk&quot; on my system and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; noticed the same thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The window system was responsive for about 20 seconds after starting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the copy and then the mouse stopped moving.  Telnetting in from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; outside got the &quot;connected&quot; message but no login prompt.  Rsh'ing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in from outside got zero response.  It took a few minutes to fill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 3.2Gb partition, and then everything was fine.  The second time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I tried this experiment, I nice'd the cp and got the same lockup.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This doesn't seem like correct behavior.  Is it taking 20 seconds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to fill the page cache and then freezing out all other processes?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is there a scheduler problem?  We're going to be setting up a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computing cluster using Linux-based dual Alpha nodes.  Management
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has observed our experiment and is now having second thoughts about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the hardware and OS choice.  But worst of all, the local NT admin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is smirking at me.  :-(
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Suggestions (including &quot;Take it to another list, please!&quot;) will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appreciated.  If you reply, please cc: me.  I've sent my subscribe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; request in, but the list is apparently not automated.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks!
</EM><BR>
