<P>
This is a test ... have been unable to post so far ...
<BR>
<P>I am the proud owner of an Alphaserver 2100A (Does not run Linux....)
<BR>
and an alphastation 500 (could , but has currently Dec Unix 4.0E)
<BR>
<P>I have heard about cooling problems on Alphastations ....
<BR>
the usual design of the desktop boxes like mine puts a heavy burden on
<BR>
the front fan to cool the system to acceptable levels.
<BR>
<P>The A500 got vey hot inside the case, yet was running OK, but i decided
<BR>
to replace the front fan with something bigger, just in case...
<BR>
... as the processor is irreplaceable here in Chile ....
<BR>
<P>The fan that came out was a NIDEC TA3500 10cm big, which i replaced 
<BR>
(discarding the plastic bracket) with a gigantic Sanyo Denki 12cm fan that
<BR>
barely fits nut cools the interior with grace .... after 10 houts of
<BR>
work , one can touch the processor .
<BR>
<P>The only problem is the noise ... i'll drill some extra holes in the front
<BR>
plate to try to smoothen the airflow.
<BR>
<P>I would advise all desktop alpha owners to check the fans carefully... and
<BR>
replace with something bigger or/and with higher airflow if needed.
<BR>
<P>Regards.
<BR>
