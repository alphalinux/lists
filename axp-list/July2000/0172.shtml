<EM>&gt; Yep.  Linux/x86 exhibits the same symptom, on a 32MB system no less...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; part of the problem I'd bet is that Paul is reading from the /dev/zero
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; device, which if I'm not mistaken is used to allocate empty pages from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; swap.  So you've got the double whammy of disk buffer and swap activity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at once.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm...  I'll have to boot a uniprocessor kernel on the dual Celeron
<BR>
I've
<BR>
got at home and see if it does the same thing.  That would pretty much
<BR>
clinch the diagnosis, I think.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't see it when copying plain files.  
</EM><BR>
<P>We don't see it with small files.  My team-mate noticed it while catting
<BR>
files together to try to make a file bigger than 4Gb. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;                                             I'd be a little surprised if a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real application were seriously affected.
</EM><BR>
<P>Me too. &quot;Real&quot; applications like Netscape and xterm run just fine.
<BR>
And I imagine even the big number-crunching CFD codes the engineers
<BR>
downstairs want to run won't have a problem, since they won't be 
<BR>
doing sustained huge file I/O.
<BR>
<P>Thanks to all of you for your thoughts.  I think I know what to tell
<BR>
the bosses now to reassure them.
