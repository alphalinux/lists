<P>
I asked:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Are there any FCAL PCI cards supported on Alpha Linux with IP as well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as SCSI protocols?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Thanks to the following for their responses:
<BR>
<P>-------- Matthew Jacob &lt;mjacob@feral.com&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Interphase- don't know if works on alphan
</EM><BR>
<P><P>-------- Greg Lindahl &lt;glindahl@hpti.com&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;We're using the Qlogic driver at FSL on Linux Alpha. I'm not sure if it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the UNM one or the Qlogic one. It's supposed to have IP support, I haven't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;used it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Is that University of New Mexico?  They have a driver for Qlogic FCAL
<BR>
HBAs?  Would the IP feature be difficult to test?
<BR>
<P><P>-------- Peter Rival &lt;frival@zk3.dec.com&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; I am currently running EMULEX LPFC 8000 on Solaris,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; which does have both protocols, but they do not currently have Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; support.  They plan to release a driver for Linux/PC soom, but said
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; nothing about Linux/Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;No, actually their press release specifically states Alpha as well as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Intel.  At least, it had better...I've got a GS160 full of Emulex adapters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;just waiting for support...
</EM><BR>
<P>I have not gotten any firm dates on when EMULEX will be providing this.
<BR>
Do you know for sure that it will happen?  Hope you don't have to wait
<BR>
too long to get your GS160 working.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;  The other possibility is to adapt the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Qlogic driver code to Linux/Alpha.  (Anyone done that yet?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That's used all the time by our CSS (I think they're still called that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;now...) folks here.  We even have an orderable part number for it.  Dunno
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about IP over FC support in that driver tho'...
</EM><BR>
<P>It looks like the Qlogic QLA2300 supports IP as well as VIA, with 2 Gb/s
<BR>
bandwidth capacity.
<BR>
<P>The reason I ask about IP capability is that this would allow me to
<BR>
have a very fast network over the same medium that's carrying my disk
<BR>
traffic.  Is that bad?  It depends on how my applications use data from
<BR>
disk and pass data among each other.  VIA support makes this more
<BR>
interesting, as this gives the ability to have highly efficient data
<BR>
exchanges among systems.
