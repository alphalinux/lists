<EM>&gt; &gt; A question. I've got a machine giving me occasional machine checks:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; TSUNAMI machine check: vector=0x630 pc=0x12000d5c8 code=0x100000086
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; TSUNAMI machine check: vector=0x670 pc=0x120032660 code=0x100000098
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How was result when you swap
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1) memory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2) CPU
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3) M/B
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We usually check above these, and problem is in one of them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, that does pretty much cover the HW, excluding the disks
<BR>
and power supply so I would hope that would find a machine check.
<BR>
<P>630/670 are cache/TLB errors so it is most likely a cartridge 
<BR>
problem but all my systems are running production right now 
<BR>
and they only stop if a problem occurs. I know swapping things 
<BR>
around will isolate the problem. All I would need to do is swap 
<BR>
one cartridge between two machines since it's a UP2K and whichever 
<BR>
one continues to have the problem is the cartridge with the problem.
<BR>
It would be nice though if Linux could identify the processor
<BR>
without having to physically swap parts. Other UNIX systems can
<BR>
identify the part number and actually call the vendor for service
<BR>
if you give the system a modem and phone line. (AIX for example)
<BR>
Identifying the part is sufficient for me though.
<BR>
<P>One thing of note. I put a line conditioner on the A/C power
<BR>
and so far over the past 12 hours or so, no machine checks.
<BR>
I know my voltage varies up to 12-13 volts during the day since
<BR>
I run another line conditioner on some other stuff. Seems to
<BR>
me though that if only one system is having hiccups, then most
<BR>
likely there is a sub-standard part in it compared to the others.
<BR>
Possibly the PS is not able to cope with the voltage fluctuations.
<BR>
Then again, I've had these cartridges go into hard loops spitting
<BR>
out these particular machine checks so it could still be the
<BR>
cartridge, not the PS.
