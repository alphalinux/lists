</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Are there any FCAL PCI cards supported on Alpha Linux with IP as well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as SCSI protocols?  I am currently running EMULEX LPFC 8000 on Solaris,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which does have both protocols, but they do not currently have Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support.  They plan to release a driver for Linux/PC soom, but said
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing about Linux/Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, actually their press release specifically states Alpha as well as
<BR>
Intel.  At least, it had better...I've got a GS160 full of Emulex adapters
<BR>
just waiting for support...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  The other possibility is to adapt the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Qlogic driver code to Linux/Alpha.  (Anyone done that yet?)
</EM><BR>
<P>That's used all the time by our CSS (I think they're still called that
<BR>
now...) folks here.  We even have an orderable part number for it.  Dunno
<BR>
about IP over FC support in that driver tho'...
