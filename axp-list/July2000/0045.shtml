<P>
Man, did I screw this one up. :-( I had a perfectly working
<BR>
Multia with ARC and now I have a paperweight. Since I had my
<BR>
other Alpha's working happily under SRM I decided (foolishly)
<BR>
that I wanted the Multia using SRM as well. In ARC, I switched
<BR>
into Digital UNIX console (to get the SRM firmware on boot).
<BR>
<P>When I turned the machine back on I got nothing. Turns out that
<BR>
this is a half-flash machine and the flash can only hold either
<BR>
ARC or SRM. No problem, I'll just start up with the Failsafe
<BR>
Loader. Well, I put the failsafe loader disk in and power cycle.
<BR>
I also moved the PWR jumper to the FSL jumper.
<BR>
<P>The disk spins for about 10 seconds and then I get no video (the
<BR>
monitor just powers down). I get no error beeps or flashing LEDs
<BR>
on the back. I figure it must be the S3 video card, so I move
<BR>
the VGA connector to the builtin TGA port. I power cycle and this
<BR>
time I get a blank screen with a white cursor in the lower left.
<BR>
But no text and I can't type anything. :-(
<BR>
<P>I'm guessing it might be the fixed frequency VGA modes. Maybe I 
<BR>
have to set a different video mode with the jumpers. However, I have
<BR>
a good multi-sync attached so I don't see why this should be a problem.
<BR>
<P>Another guess it the S3 card. Should I try taking it out completely?
<BR>
Maybe it is confusing the SRM firmware, although I now have the monitor
<BR>
connected to the TGA port.
<BR>
<P>Any clues? I'm dead in the water and at this point just want a working
<BR>
system back, either ARC or preferably SRM.
<BR>
<P>P.S. It's not the hardware...it's been running Linux fine all along...it's
<BR>
just when I switched to SRM that the problems began. The power connectors
<BR>
and RAM are seated just fine too.
<BR>
<P>Please help if you can.
<BR>
<P>/Michael
