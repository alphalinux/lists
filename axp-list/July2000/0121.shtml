<P><EM>&gt; A question. I've got a machine giving me occasional machine checks:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TSUNAMI machine check: vector=0x630 pc=0x12000d5c8 code=0x100000086
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TSUNAMI machine check: vector=0x670 pc=0x120032660 code=0x100000098
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In those PC and code numbers, does anything tell me which processor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is having the cache/TLB problem? It would be nice if the machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; check code could determine what processor in an SMP setup is getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the errors. This of course assumes only the processor that really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had the machine check also services the machine check. Is that a true
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; condition? Then all that's needed is the machine check code would have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to figure out the processor it's on. Any thoughts appreciated. I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like a more precise message so I don't have to start swapping processors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around to figure out which one is sick.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe Jay once mentioned (here I go again, quoting Jay...;) that
<BR>
mchecks are asynchronously delivered, except for 660 &amp; 670.  This would
<BR>
mean that the CPU servicing the mcheck may not be the one that caused it.
<BR>
If my memory hasn't completely left me, with 660 &amp; 670 being the exception
<BR>
to this, you should be able to get the CPU number from within the mcheck
<BR>
code and dump it out if it's a 660 or 670 vector.  Of course, trying it
<BR>
doesn't hurt, I'd imagine. ;)  Worst thing should be that it randomly jumps
<BR>
between processors and you haven't gotten any further.
