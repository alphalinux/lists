<P>
Greetings!
<BR>
<P>I've recently come into possession of a Symbolics-branded XP1000
<BR>
box.  It's apparently a 500MHz Alpha with 512MB and a nice fast
<BR>
SCSI disk.  It had some sort of lisp software loaded on top of
<BR>
Tru64 Unix.  Being unfamiliar with the hardware, it was a bit of a
<BR>
struggle, but the machine now runs RedHat 6.2.  At this point, it's
<BR>
still pretty much in its out-of-the-box condition.  In particular,
<BR>
I haven't upgraded the 2.2.14 kernel.
<BR>
<P>One of my co-workers with an identical system was testing files
<BR>
<EM>&gt;2Gb and noticed that the system appeared to lock up during large
</EM><BR>
file copies.  I tried &quot;cp /dev/zero /local/junk&quot; on my system and
<BR>
noticed the same thing.
<BR>
<P>The window system was responsive for about 20 seconds after starting
<BR>
the copy and then the mouse stopped moving.  Telnetting in from
<BR>
outside got the &quot;connected&quot; message but no login prompt.  Rsh'ing
<BR>
in from outside got zero response.  It took a few minutes to fill
<BR>
the 3.2Gb partition, and then everything was fine.  The second time
<BR>
I tried this experiment, I nice'd the cp and got the same lockup.
<BR>
<P>This doesn't seem like correct behavior.  Is it taking 20 seconds
<BR>
to fill the page cache and then freezing out all other processes?
<BR>
Is there a scheduler problem?  We're going to be setting up a
<BR>
computing cluster using Linux-based dual Alpha nodes.  Management 
<BR>
has observed our experiment and is now having second thoughts about 
<BR>
the hardware and OS choice.  But worst of all, the local NT admin
<BR>
is smirking at me.  :-(
<BR>
<P>Suggestions (including &quot;Take it to another list, please!&quot;) will be
<BR>
appreciated.  If you reply, please cc: me.  I've sent my subscribe
<BR>
request in, but the list is apparently not automated.
<BR>
<P>Thanks!
<BR>
<P>Paul Allen
