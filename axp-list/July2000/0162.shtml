<P><EM>&gt; A week or so ago, I sent the attached query to the list and got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; zero response.  OK, maybe there's nobody technical here.  Or maybe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everybody's busy.  If I get no response to this second try, I'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; go find somewhere else to ask.

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; Basically, we've noticed that continuous disk I/O on an Alpha running
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stock RedHat 6.2 locks the system up.  No mouse movement, no keyboard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; response, no network activity except for answering pings.  When the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long-running I/O completes, the system returns to normal.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I need to know if this is normal behavior and if there is anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can do to improve the situation.  I am a long-time Unix admin and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have been running Linux on Intel hardware since about the 0.95 days,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but am new to Linux on Alpha hardware.  Any suggestions or pointers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to which FM to R would be appreciated.  I am on the list, so you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can reply to me or to the list as you see fit.

<P><P>Linux has a bit of a Feature;) in that when there is a lot of disk buffers
<BR>
that need to be written out to disk, Linux will write them all out at once
<BR>
and take some time to do it. While this is happning things will generaly
<BR>
grind to a halt.
