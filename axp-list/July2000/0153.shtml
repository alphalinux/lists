Wes -
<BR>
<P>There's a list of vector meanings, but the only ones anyone ever sees 
<BR>
are 630=single bit ECC, 670=multi-bit ECC.  Both are detected by the 
<BR>
processor and can apply to any data path to which it is connected 
<BR>
(internal, bcache, system bus).  ECC detected by Tsanami will come by 
<BR>
another route (660).  I believe the machine check is posted 
<BR>
immediately after it occurrs on the relevant CPU.
<BR>
<P>There is additional information about the machine check passed in a 
<BR>
'logout frame' from PALcode.  This can be unpicked and made sense of 
<BR>
using the processor spec.  I wrote a piece of code that applied the 
<BR>
rules in that table, usually successfully, to get more information 
<BR>
about what was amiss.  Its in the UP1000 kernel code 
<BR>
(arch/alpha/kernel/sys_nautilus.c) but everything in there applies to 
<BR>
any EV6 system.
<BR>
<P>The power supply line conditioner seems to point to the source of 
<BR>
your problems.  Its no coincidence that most Alpha motherboards seem 
<BR>
to have capacitors the size of golf balls on them...
<BR>

<EM>&gt;&gt;  &gt; A question. I've got a machine giving me occasional machine checks:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  &gt; TSUNAMI machine check: vector=0x630 pc=0x12000d5c8 code=0x100000086
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  &gt; TSUNAMI machine check: vector=0x670 pc=0x120032660 code=0x100000098
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  How was result when you swap
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  1) memory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  2) CPU
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  3) M/B
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  We usually check above these, and problem is in one of them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Well, that does pretty much cover the HW, excluding the disks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and power supply so I would hope that would find a machine check.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;630/670 are cache/TLB errors so it is most likely a cartridge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problem but all my systems are running production right now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and they only stop if a problem occurs. I know swapping things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;around will isolate the problem. All I would need to do is swap
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one cartridge between two machines since it's a UP2K and whichever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one continues to have the problem is the cartridge with the problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It would be nice though if Linux could identify the processor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;without having to physically swap parts. Other UNIX systems can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;identify the part number and actually call the vendor for service
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if you give the system a modem and phone line. (AIX for example)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Identifying the part is sufficient for me though.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;One thing of note. I put a line conditioner on the A/C power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and so far over the past 12 hours or so, no machine checks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I know my voltage varies up to 12-13 volts during the day since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I run another line conditioner on some other stuff. Seems to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;me though that if only one system is having hiccups, then most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;likely there is a sub-standard part in it compared to the others.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Possibly the PS is not able to cope with the voltage fluctuations.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Then again, I've had these cartridges go into hard loops spitting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;out these particular machine checks so it could still be the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cartridge, not the PS.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
