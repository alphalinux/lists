I managed to get this going. Oddly enough, when I got the white cursor
<BR>
in the lower left, I opened the case and unplugged the battery. When I
<BR>
power cycled the next time, the text came up! I don't know why I had to
<BR>
unplug the battery, but when I plugged it back in a second time it still
<BR>
worked. Very strange. I can't explain it but it's working at least.

<P><P><P><EM>&gt;I'm guessing it might be the fixed frequency VGA modes. Maybe I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have to set a different video mode with the jumpers. However, I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a good multi-sync attached so I don't see why this should be a problem.
</EM><BR>
<P>I did the same thing with a Multia. I switched to SRM and it was a blank
<BR>
screen. I had a cheap 14&quot; monitor attached. I plugged in a ViewSonic G790
<BR>
and there it was.... an SRM prompt.
<BR>
<P>Your machine will probably accept commands, and you can blindly type in
<BR>
*arc* (be wise to check this out first) and ARC will restart if I remember
<BR>
right. Again... check this out before actually doing it.
