<EM>&gt; I had a problem with these machine checks as well.  I'm not sure about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this, but I think it was a bad DIMM that was causing it.  Though, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; did have the CPUs replaced in the ES40 I was getting the machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; checks in.  I'm pretty sure I had the Compaq guys swap out my memory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and that was what stopped those machine checks from occurring.  You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; may trying swapping the DIMMs in your box to see if that fixes it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<P>Well, I'm basing my comments on a table Jay Estabrook posted
<BR>
a while back that said 630/670 were cache/TLB errors. That 
<BR>
and when I had these twice before, it was a bad cartidge. 
<BR>
I also want to use some of the Nautilus machine check code
<BR>
to more carefully describe the machine check. Haven't hooked that
<BR>
up yet but it's looks pretty straight forward to do. That code
<BR>
should actually tell if it's cache/memory/tlb.
<BR>
<P>Getting errors on both porcessors does seem to indicate it might
<BR>
fit a memory problem though if the machine check is always serviced
<BR>
by the processor that had it. Still can't confirm that is true.

<EM>&gt; &gt; OK, I've added code to my kernel to print out what processor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is servicing a machine check. At least that's what I think a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; call to smp_processor_id() returns. Someone correct me if that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is not what this routine does. The machine checks are pretty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; evenly serviced by both processors in the UP2K so either the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; machine checks don't stick to the processor with the problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or both my cartidges are sick. Seems unlikely both cartridges
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would have the problem, but not impossible. So, now I want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; look at the details of the machine check and I saw a structure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; entry called &quot;mchk_header-&gt;proc_offset&quot;. My hope is this points
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to info about which processor had the problem but I can't find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a structure description of what it points to. If someone knows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; where such a beast is or where docs are that describe it, please
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; let me know. I looked at the 21264 HW reference and didn't find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; any likely candidates.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Any info appreciated.
