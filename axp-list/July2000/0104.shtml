Hello Michael,
<BR>
<P>I'll just clarify what I've done. I hope you and/or others can shed light on 
<BR>
this.
<BR>
I had NT4 running on an XL366, 256Mb. AlphaBIOS 5.70
<BR>
<P>Installed MILO and LINLOAD.EXE onto C:\OS\Linux
<BR>
Added Linux to the BIOS &quot;Operating System Selection Setup&quot;
<BR>
(but without any OPTIONS)
<BR>
<P>I installed RedHat 6.2 and added a Linux Native and a Linux Swap
<BR>
partition. It said it was going to create /dev/sda3. Yes, format it please.
<BR>
<P>Note: The currently functioning config is:
<BR>
Boot Name:  Linux
<BR>
Boot File:  Disk 0, Partition 4  \os\Linux\linload.exe
<BR>
OS Path:    CD:                  \os\Linux\milo
<BR>
OS Options: boot sda1:boot/vmlinux-2.2.14-6.0 root=/dev/sda1
<BR>
<P><P>After the initial install, I tried to run milo without OPTIONS (ie select 
<BR>
&quot;Linux&quot; from the boot menu), which gave me the MILO prompt. I then used 
<BR>
SHOW, which listed SDA1 as ext2, which failed to boot, no matter what I put 
<BR>
in. When I did an 'ls sda1', it clearly showed the NT file system files. 
<BR>
Tried boot sda1, sda2, sda5,
<BR>
all to no avail. sda3 was _not_ in the list, even though I clearly saw the 
<BR>
Linux install merrily referring to /dev/sda3 every time.
<BR>
hmm.. will I ever see the penguin?!!!
<BR>
<P>After re-running the install a few times, and trying every available 
<BR>
partition, I decided that MILO wasn't seeing the Linux partition.
<BR>
As it seemed fixated that sda1 was ext2, even though it clearly wasn't, I 
<BR>
surmised that it expected sda1 to be Linux.
<BR>
<P>I then re-ran install, deleted the NT partition, deleted the Linux partion, 
<BR>
put Linux into the space where NT was and was able to boot!
<BR>
I then re-ran the NT install and put that onto the empty partition space 
<BR>
where I'd had Linux earlier.
<BR>
<P>I now happily can select NT or Linux from the AlphaBIOS Boot Menu.
<BR>
<P>Sooo... While I'm up and running, the install just didn't go the way I would 
<BR>
have expected. To my eyes, it clearly looks like MILO was the problem. If 
<BR>
not, then if you can clarify what goes on, maybe I'll see the light :-)
<BR>
<P>Luke.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Just FYI I happen to have here a somewhat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;unusual machine, :-)  which is using milo, and which at this moment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;can boot various variants of Linux from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;/dev/sda2, /dev/sdb2, /dev/sdc2, /dev/sdc7 and /dev/sdc10
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   Well that's marvelous and reassuring to hear. You make the notable 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that they're all Linux partitions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Somehow I suspect that we are talking about different stages of booting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;here.  If I boot Linux then I expect that its root partition will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be of a Linux type. :-)  But kernel can be actually loaded from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any other partition/device which is readable to milo.  It DOES NOT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have to be a root partition; even if usually is for the sake of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;convenience and sanity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Are you failing trying to load milo?  Your description of problems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is quite incomplete and confusing.  Quoting actual error messages
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(and what produced them) usually greatly help others to understand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;what you are talking about.  Otherwise you leave everybody guessing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I hoped for dual-boot Linux &amp; NT4 without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; drama.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yes, there is in reality nothing special to that.  The same partition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which is used by your console to load an NT loader can hold milo, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;its first stage loader, and even your kernel image if you so desire.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Making a new directory for that stuff is recommended for organizational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reasons but not required.  Your Linux root partition has to be somewhere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;else.  :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Were you attempting to load stuff from an NTFS partition - by any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;chance?  This will not work.  Your firmware, and milo, do not know that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;file system type.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   Milo says built on 2.0.30
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This should not matter as long as you are not attempting to get milo to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;load something from an ext2 file system formatted with a block size of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;4096 and/or sparse superblocks.  You want some cutting-edge stuff then
