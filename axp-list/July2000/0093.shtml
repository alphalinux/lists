<P>
<EM>&gt; Just FYI I happen to have here a somewhat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;unusual machine, :-)  which is using milo, and which at this moment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;can boot various variants of Linux from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;/dev/sda2, /dev/sdb2, /dev/sdc2, /dev/sdc7 and /dev/sdc10
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Well that's marvelous and reassuring to hear. You make the notable point 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that they're all Linux partitions.
</EM><BR>
<P>Somehow I suspect that we are talking about different stages of booting
<BR>
here.  If I boot Linux then I expect that its root partition will
<BR>
be of a Linux type. :-)  But kernel can be actually loaded from
<BR>
any other partition/device which is readable to milo.  It DOES NOT
<BR>
have to be a root partition; even if usually is for the sake of a
<BR>
convenience and sanity.
<BR>
<P>Are you failing trying to load milo?  Your description of problems
<BR>
is quite incomplete and confusing.  Quoting actual error messages
<BR>
(and what produced them) usually greatly help others to understand
<BR>
what you are talking about.  Otherwise you leave everybody guessing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I hoped for dual-boot Linux &amp; NT4 without 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drama.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, there is in reality nothing special to that.  The same partition
<BR>
which is used by your console to load an NT loader can hold milo, and
<BR>
its first stage loader, and even your kernel image if you so desire.
<BR>
Making a new directory for that stuff is recommended for organizational
<BR>
reasons but not required.  Your Linux root partition has to be somewhere
<BR>
else.  :-)
<BR>
<P>Were you attempting to load stuff from an NTFS partition - by any
<BR>
chance?  This will not work.  Your firmware, and milo, do not know that
<BR>
file system type.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Milo says built on 2.0.30
</EM><BR>
<P>This should not matter as long as you are not attempting to get milo to
<BR>
load something from an ext2 file system formatted with a block size of
<BR>
4096 and/or sparse superblocks.  You want some cutting-edge stuff then
