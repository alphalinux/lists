<P>
Has anyone out there ever been able to get the SRM &quot;memexer&quot; command to
<BR>
work on an LX164 machine?  If so, I'd really like to know what version
<BR>
of the SRM you are using.
<BR>
<P>When I try &quot;memexer&quot; at the SRM prompt, it never works.  I tried it on two
<BR>
different LX machines, one with the latest SRM, the other with one from
<BR>
late 1997 (see below for version numbers).  One machine has 1GB of ram,
<BR>
and the other has only 64 MB. On both machines, the most typical behavior
<BR>
after typing &quot;memexer&quot; is that the screen goes black and the machine
<BR>
reboots (as if I had pressed the reset button).  Rarely, maybe once out of
<BR>
10 or 15 tries, the machine does not reboot, but show_status says that the
<BR>
number of bytes read and written by memexer is 0.  Repeated execution of
<BR>
show_status always says the same:  nothing read or written. 
<BR>
<P>Any help would be greatly appreciated!

<P><P>Here are some more details:
<BR>
<P>The hardware:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;164LX motherboard, 21164a, 533MHz, 1 GB SDRAM (4*256MB)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 Digital DE-500A NICs
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 Intraserver 3140U SCSI card
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 SCSI hard disks
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 SCSI tape drive (4mm DAT)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 SCSI CDROM drive 12X Toshiba
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 IDE  CDROM drive 12X Toshiba
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 floppy drive
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matrox Millennium II video card, 4Mb
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;300 W power supply
<BR>
<P>The firmware and software:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently I am using SRM V5.3-3 Sep 24 1998 14:02:11, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;downloaded around May or June of 2000.   I had previously used 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.9-51 and 5.0-1.  I am using aboot 0.5-7, the one that came with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RedHat 5.2.  I have used RedHat 4.2 and 5.2 with this machine.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently it has a RedHat 5.2 that has had its compiler upgraded
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to egcs-2.91.66 and its kernel upgraded to 2.2.14.
<BR>
<P>The second machine I tried has the same model motherboard and cpu, but
<BR>
only one hard drive, no cdrom and no tape drives, and only one NIC.
