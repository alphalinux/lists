<P>Hmmm...  that's what appears to be happening.  I've just never noticed
<BR>
it on any other platform.  I've seen Linux on SPARC and Intel, for
<BR>
example, and haven't noticed this sort of thing.  I routinely do large
<BR>
disk-to-disk copies on my home system, for example, and never have
<BR>
the mouse freeze on me.  Is this specific to the Alpha port?  Or,
<BR>
is it related to having way too much RAM?
<BR>
<P>Thanks for the reply, by the way.
