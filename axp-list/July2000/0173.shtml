<P>
For what its worth, I have used an AdvanSys 3940U2W in UP1000 (also 
<BR>
an AlphaBIOS system).  The system detected the card and used the 
<BR>
SCSI-BIOS generic miniport driver instead of a dedicated driver (such 
<BR>
as used by Adaptec).  Perhaps this difference is the source of your 
<BR>
grief.
<BR>
<P>Did you see the AdvanSys option ROM executing before the AlphaBIOS 
<BR>
splash screen?  I can't remember what its called but it has a red bar 
<BR>
at the top of the screen with yellow text.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps switching to SRM might help in that SRM doesn't try so hard 
<BR>
to setup stuff it doesn't understand.
<BR>
<P>The driver in the kernel source tree (about 6 months ago) was 
<BR>
incompatible with Alpha but there was a driver on the AdvanSys 
<BR>
website which worked and has since made its way into the kernel 
<BR>
sources.
<BR>
<P>The card's performance was very good, but I don't have any 
<BR>
quantitative numbers to back that up.
<BR>

<P><P><P><EM>&gt;that mirrors my experience on my lx164 with the abp 930ua.  alphabios shows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the card and one of my 3 disks, but it won't recognize my cdrom drive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(plextor).  It appears that there is a kernel module (searched the install
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cd) but with a scsi cdrom you can't get there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I saw that same claim on the advansys website and even emailed them telling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them my woes and asking if another controller would work, but they have not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;responded.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I tried SRM 5.5-1 and it doesn't recognize the card.  Don't try 5.7 from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;compaq website, as it requires a license.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm trying to find a KNOWN good cheap card, my intraserver 3140 is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;recognized, but fails during the file load.  I'd hate to pay $300 for a dec
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;card.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  Hello !
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  I just got an AdvanSys board (ASB 3940UA) which they claim runs Linux.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  Since the web page informed me that Linux/Alpha was supported as well,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  I put the card into the last PCI slot I had and booted.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  The graphics card and my other SCSI card (Adaptec) are recognized as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;usual,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  but at the point when AlphaBIOS should appear, nothing happens (I let it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  sit there for several minutes). I tried 32 and 64 bit slots, swapping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  the graphics card and removing my TV card but nothing changed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  Has anybody run a similar card and if so, what did you do ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  Would switching to SRM help or is this hang a definitive no-go ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  Thanks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
