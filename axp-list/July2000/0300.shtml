<P>We've been seeing thread problems as well here at LLNL.  None of us
<BR>
have had time to look into it more.  We're working on a parallel
<BR>
file system and when we ran with pthreads, it would cause the server to
<BR>
hang shortly after starting (it uses a work pile for handling
<BR>
requests).  Some researchers over at Compaq's SRC took the pthread
<BR>
code and strip a bunch of code out of it to make a thread library that
<BR>
wouldn't hang.  I was told that they sent a message to Xavier Leroy
<BR>
about the problem, but I don't know for sure that anything was done
<BR>
about it.  From what I understand, there are missing memory barriers
<BR>
in the locking routines.  I've seen condition variables fall through
<BR>
when another thread has already grabbed the mutex (more than one
<BR>
thread holding a mutex at once).  They seemed to think the problem
<BR>
existed on Intel as well but it seems to be a little harder to
<BR>
trigger.
