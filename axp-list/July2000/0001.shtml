<P>
I was asking few days ago if somebody knows something about a problem
<BR>
with libraries from RH 6.2 when a program linked dynamic behaves like
<BR>
it should but linked static fails because 'getpwuid()' always returns
<BR>
null.
<BR>
<P>The problem is real, all right, but you are not very likely to run
<BR>
into it. :-) After digging deeply through sources of glibc and
<BR>
prolonged debuggin sessions I found that a function
<BR>
'do_lookup_versioned()' from dl-lookup.c was failing for some dynamic
<BR>
loader symbol.  A reason for that turn out to be that from some old
<BR>
forgotten experiments I had a subdirectory /lib/old/ with a copy of an
<BR>
old version of ld-linux.so.2 in it.  I do not understand a mechanism
<BR>
and why this copy was used in the first place (my /etc/ld.so.conf is
<BR>
sane) but removing /lib/old made both versions of my test program to
<BR>
behave.
<BR>
<P>To add to the confusion even if a program is compiled statically, and
<BR>
'file' and 'ldd' say about exectutables &quot;statically linked&quot; and &quot;not a
<BR>
dynamic executable&quot;, turns out that libnss* libraries are still
<BR>
dynamically loaded (different things may be consulted depending on what
<BR>
you have in /etc/nsswitch.conf).  Also nothing bad was happening before
<BR>
an update, even if /lib/old/ was there all the time,  and with a
<BR>
dynamically linked version.  Big sigh!
