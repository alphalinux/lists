I had a problem with these machine checks as well.  I'm not sure about
<BR>
this, but I think it was a bad DIMM that was causing it.  Though, I
<BR>
did have the CPUs replaced in the ES40 I was getting the machine
<BR>
checks in.  I'm pretty sure I had the Compaq guys swap out my memory
<BR>
and that was what stopped those machine checks from occurring.  You
<BR>
may trying swapping the DIMMs in your box to see if that fixes it.

<EM>&gt; OK, I've added code to my kernel to print out what processor

<EM>&gt; is servicing a machine check. At least that's what I think a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; call to smp_processor_id() returns. Someone correct me if that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is not what this routine does. The machine checks are pretty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evenly serviced by both processors in the UP2K so either the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machine checks don't stick to the processor with the problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or both my cartidges are sick. Seems unlikely both cartridges
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would have the problem, but not impossible. So, now I want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; look at the details of the machine check and I saw a structure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; entry called &quot;mchk_header-&gt;proc_offset&quot;. My hope is this points
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to info about which processor had the problem but I can't find 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a structure description of what it points to. If someone knows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where such a beast is or where docs are that describe it, please
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; let me know. I looked at the 21264 HW reference and didn't find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any likely candidates.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Any info appreciated.
