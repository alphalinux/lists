<P>
Dear Alpha Linux folks,
<BR>
<P>I have 2 possibly related questions:
<BR>
<P>(1)
<BR>
<P>I'm getting some strange, intermittent weirdness from my LX164,
<BR>
which is running a RedHat 5.2 system upgraded to a 2.2 kernel.
<BR>
When I upgraded the kernel to 2.2.1 about a year ago, I applied
<BR>
all the other software upgrades recommended in the kernel docs,
<BR>
and the system worked OK since then.  Then, around the beginning
<BR>
of June, I made 3 changes to my system: I upgraded the SRM, upgraded
<BR>
the kernel from 2.2.1 to 2.2.14, and upgraded the SDRAM from 128
<BR>
MB to 1 GB.  The weirdness started happening soon after that.  Here
<BR>
are the symptoms:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About once or twice a week, when I type in some command at the system 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prompt (like 'ls', 'vi', or 'grep', for example), the command will fail 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to execute and I'll get a bunch of error messages like this:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;free(6d00690076) above top of memory. (memtop = 1201a0c00 membot = 120177a00)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;free(1201701fd) below bottom of memory. (memtop = 1201a0c00 membot = 120177a00)
<BR>
<P>On other occasions I'll get this:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illegal instruction (core dumped)
<BR>
<P>And sometimes it will just segfault and dump core with no other message.
<BR>
When I use gdb to examine the core file, it of course cannot tell me
<BR>
where the crash happened, because gdb can't read core files on an Alpha
<BR>
Linux system (something I've lamented about before on this list).  It
<BR>
does, however, consistently say that the crash happened in &quot;-csh&quot;, so
<BR>
it's probably the shell (or some system call made by the shell) that's 
<BR>
getting into trouble.
<BR>
<P>Whatever the error message is, if I just retype the identical command a 
<BR>
second time, it (so far) always works correctly without a hitch.
<BR>
<P>There is yet another weirdness that sometimes happens when the machine
<BR>
is booting.  In aboot, after the line
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** not timer interrupts on CPU0 **
<BR>
<P>appears, the machine just hangs, and responds only to the reset button.
<BR>
It will then boot normally.  This also seems to happen about once every
<BR>
week or two.  The next thing aboot normally writes to the screen after 
<BR>
the above message is something about reading the partition tables on the
<BR>
hard disks, so maybe the disk or scsi card is involved in this problem.
<BR>
This problem also appeared after I did the 3 upgrades listed above.
<BR>
<P>Several possiblilities have occurred to me.  One is that I may need
<BR>
to recompile tcsh (the shell I'm using) because of some incompatibility
<BR>
with 2.2.14.  I am planning to restore the 2.2.1 kernel to see if
<BR>
that makes some of these symptoms go away, but, because it is not
<BR>
a readily reproducible problem, it will be hard to know if anything
<BR>
I do has really fixed it.
<BR>
<P>Has anyone seen symptoms like this?  Any suggestions?
<BR>
Could it be a problem of an inadequate power supply?  The machine has a
<BR>
300W supply but lots of stuff in it (see attachment).
<BR>
<P>The other possibility is that I may have defective SDRAM.  This brings
<BR>
up my next question:
<BR>
<P>(2)
<BR>
<P>How do I test memory in an LX164 machine?  
<BR>
<P>I compiled and ran memtester-2.88 (as root, with memoryuse and
<BR>
memorylocked unlimited), but it gave a zillion messages saying it
<BR>
could not lock memory, like this:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Allocated 537296896 bytes...trying mlock...failed:  insufficient resources.
<BR>
<P>each time trying a smaller amount, until it finally succeeded:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Allocated 536240128 bytes...trying mlock...success.  Starting tests...
<BR>
<P>It ran tests on this amount, and they all succeeded, but this is only
<BR>
about half the memory in the machine.
<BR>
<P><P>I read in the SRM documentation about its &quot;memexer&quot; and &quot;memtest&quot;
<BR>
commands, but these don't work at all on my machine.  The first time I
<BR>
tried memexer at the SRM prompt, the screen went black and the machine
<BR>
rebooted itself.  The second time I tried it, it appeared to be running,
<BR>
but when I typed show_status, I got this:
<BR>
<P>ID        Program  Device  Pass  Hard/Soft  Bytes written  Bytes read
<BR>
--------  -------  ------  ----  ---------  -------------  -----------
<BR>
00000001    idle   system   0      0   0          0             0
<BR>
00000051  memtest  memory   1      0   0          0             0
<BR>
<P>which says to me that the memtest isn't actually doing anything.  As I
<BR>
understand it, memexer is some kind of SRM script that invokes memtest.
<BR>
The SRM documentation for memtest is utterly incomprehensible to me, but
<BR>
I tried running one of the memtest examples from the SRM manual:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;memtest -sa 200000 -l 1000
<BR>
<P>As I understand it, this is supposed to test 0x1000 bytes starting at
<BR>
0x200000.  This just made the machine hang.  I waited for about 45
<BR>
minutes, which seemed ample time to test 4096 bytes, but nothing
<BR>
happened.  Only a hard reset would wake up the machine.
<BR>
<P><P>I'd be grateful for any pointers to memory testing software, advice
<BR>
about the weird errors from the shell, and I would especially like to 
<BR>
beg the kind and generous folks from Compaq who follow this list to tell
<BR>
me how to get SRM's memexer and memtest to work.
<BR>
<P>TIA,
<BR>
Jack
<BR>

<BR>
weird error messages, for anyone who is interested.
