<EM>&gt; Thank you all for the suggestions on my AS800 installation, especially Jay++
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the hint to check the other terminals.  After much consertnation, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appears that the problem is with the cdrom timing out.  Since both SCSI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cd drives I have are the same model, I'm suspicious of them.  Therefore I'd like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to try an nfs install, but haven't managed to get the syntax down from SRM.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've got a DHCP server with the Alpha cd exported on /mnt/cdrom.  I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; managed to mount the cd from another workstation on the LAN.  The Alpha does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allow configuration of the network card through alphabios, and when booted from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the floopy or (sometimes) the cd using dva0 or dka300 it appears the network
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; card is detected.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Does anyone know the correct syntax to do an NFS install from SRM, using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perhaps the -flags parameter?  I tried nfsroot=nfsserver:/mnt/cdrom but that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was just a guess.  The x86 disk contains a different boot image... is there a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nfs boot image for the as800?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Do you mean an NFS install to local disk or using an 
<BR>
NFS root file system? Assuming you mean an install to 
<BR>
local disk, just boot using two floppies, boot/ramdisk 
<BR>
and when it asks where to install from, select the NFS 
<BR>
option and setup your network card and tell it where to 
<BR>
mount from and it just works, at least it does for me with 
<BR>
RH6.1 on XP1000's and UP2K's. I don't install CDROM's in 
<BR>
machines anymore and always use this method. Also, make sure
<BR>
you're allowing the IP address to mount from the NFS server.
<BR>
If it can't mount it, it will complain and ask you to try
<BR>
again.
