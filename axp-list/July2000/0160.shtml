<P>
that mirrors my experience on my lx164 with the abp 930ua.  alphabios shows
<BR>
the card and one of my 3 disks, but it won't recognize my cdrom drive
<BR>
(plextor).  It appears that there is a kernel module (searched the install
<BR>
cd) but with a scsi cdrom you can't get there.
<BR>
<P>I saw that same claim on the advansys website and even emailed them telling
<BR>
them my woes and asking if another controller would work, but they have not
<BR>
responded.
<BR>
<P>I tried SRM 5.5-1 and it doesn't recognize the card.  Don't try 5.7 from the
<BR>
compaq website, as it requires a license.
<BR>
<P>I'm trying to find a KNOWN good cheap card, my intraserver 3140 is
<BR>
recognized, but fails during the file load.  I'd hate to pay $300 for a dec
<BR>
card.

<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Hello !
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I just got an AdvanSys board (ASB 3940UA) which they claim runs Linux.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since the web page informed me that Linux/Alpha was supported as well,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I put the card into the last PCI slot I had and booted.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The graphics card and my other SCSI card (Adaptec) are recognized as
</EM><BR>
usual,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; but at the point when AlphaBIOS should appear, nothing happens (I let it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sit there for several minutes). I tried 32 and 64 bit slots, swapping
</EM><BR>
around
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the graphics card and removing my TV card but nothing changed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Has anybody run a similar card and if so, what did you do ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Would switching to SRM help or is this hang a definitive no-go ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
