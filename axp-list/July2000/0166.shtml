<EM>&gt; Hmmm...  that's what appears to be happening.  I've just never noticed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it on any other platform.  I've seen Linux on SPARC and Intel, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; example, and haven't noticed this sort of thing.  I routinely do large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disk-to-disk copies on my home system, for example, and never have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the mouse freeze on me.  Is this specific to the Alpha port?  Or,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is it related to having way too much RAM?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<P>I don't see this at all and I move massive amounts of data
<BR>
on my systems(Think multi GB files). It may get a bit sluggish 
<BR>
but it still responds which is what I expect. Note however,
<BR>
I keep Linux on it's own disk, not where I store data. I give
<BR>
Linux a token drive of a few GB and then put very large UATA66
<BR>
drives on Promise cards. Just assembled an XP1000 with 4 60GB
<BR>
Maxtor drives. As to your problem, I'd bet you're using the same 
<BR>
disk for OS and data. Add a separate data disk and I'll bet 
<BR>
it works fine. Heck, you can buy a 60GB Maxtor for $240 and
<BR>
a promise card for $30 and have massive data storage for $270...
<BR>
<P>SCSI isn't even close for $$/MB. You could buy 3 60GB Maxtors
<BR>
for the price of a 50GB SCSI drive. 
<BR>
<P>You will need the E-IDE DMA patches to make it hum. Contact me
<BR>
if you decide to try it and I can tell you what to watch out
<BR>
for.
