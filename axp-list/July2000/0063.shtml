<P>
Thank you all for the suggestions on my AS800 installation, especially Jay++
<BR>
for the hint to check the other terminals.  After much consertnation, it
<BR>
appears that the problem is with the cdrom timing out.  Since both SCSI
<BR>
cd drives I have are the same model, I'm suspicious of them.  Therefore I'd like
<BR>
to try an nfs install, but haven't managed to get the syntax down from SRM.  
<BR>
<P>I've got a DHCP server with the Alpha cd exported on /mnt/cdrom.  I've
<BR>
managed to mount the cd from another workstation on the LAN.  The Alpha does
<BR>
allow configuration of the network card through alphabios, and when booted from
<BR>
the floopy or (sometimes) the cd using dva0 or dka300 it appears the network
<BR>
card is detected.   
<BR>
<P>Does anyone know the correct syntax to do an NFS install from SRM, using
<BR>
perhaps the -flags parameter?  I tried nfsroot=nfsserver:/mnt/cdrom but that
<BR>
was just a guess.  The x86 disk contains a different boot image... is there a
<BR>
nfs boot image for the as800?  
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
