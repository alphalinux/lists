Hi folks.
<BR>
<P>If you're sick of reading about the 3000/300, hit delete now. I'm going
<BR>
to ramble a bit. :)
<BR>
<P>I've been devouring list archives of this list, and the Decstation Linux
<BR>
list for a while now, and finally have a tiny bit of time on my hands.
<BR>
What I'm wondering about is the possibilty of getting approximately 1
<BR>
dozen 3000/300LX machines I have here at work running a decent (read:
<BR>
Linux) OS.
<BR>
<P>Now correct me if I'm wrong, please - but as I understand it, the 3000
<BR>
is not much more than a Decstation with an Alpha processor instead of a
<BR>
MIPS. Same basic hardware, right? 
<BR>
<P>The Decstation Linux people supposedly have working
<BR>
keyboards/mice/framebuffers hell, they seem to have most of it going.
<BR>
The NetBSD folk even have audio working.
<BR>
<P>So am I dreaming when I think it might be possible to drag the
<BR>
Turbochannel drivers and other support out of the Decstation patches and
<BR>
compile for Alpha? Is anyone working on this? I've been crawling over
<BR>
the web and found the occasional discontinued project, but nothing
<BR>
current.
<BR>
<P>It seems to me the pieces are out there, but nobody has put them
<BR>
together. Anyone want to help with a jigsaw puzzle where we're not sure
<BR>
where all the pieces are?
<BR>
<P>Of course, if I've made stupid assumptions, please tell me to stop
<BR>
wasting my time and go buy Tru64. :)
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
Mike.
