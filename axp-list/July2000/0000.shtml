</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; process.  This latest version makes it to about the same point and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then jumps all the way back to starting place for milo.  The banner
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; starts spinning again after you see some PCI setup activity and

<EM>&gt; that is as far as it gets.

<P>This sounds suspiciously like a BIOS emulation issue.  The last MILO I
<BR>
used was the one that came with RH 4.2, with the DEC BIOS emulation.  Do
<BR>
current versions of MILO still use the freeware emulation?  I understand
<BR>
the free emulation had some difficulty with certain BIOSes.
<BR>
<P>I'm curious... why use MILO at all now that SRM is freely available for
<BR>
the 164SX?  MILO has several serious disadvantages.  Also, why the need
<BR>
to upgrade MILO?  Any version that recognizes your machine should work. 
<BR>
It doesn't need to match your kernel version.  If the PALcode had
<BR>
changed however, it could be worth upgrading, but isn't MILO still using
<BR>
the old sample PALcode from the EBSDK?
<BR>
<P>I'm not trying to flame here, I'm just honestly wondering why people
<BR>
still need/want MILO.
