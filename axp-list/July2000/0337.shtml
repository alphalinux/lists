OK, I've added code to my kernel to print out what processor
<BR>
is servicing a machine check. At least that's what I think a
<BR>
call to smp_processor_id() returns. Someone correct me if that
<BR>
is not what this routine does. The machine checks are pretty
<BR>
evenly serviced by both processors in the UP2K so either the
<BR>
machine checks don't stick to the processor with the problem
<BR>
or both my cartidges are sick. Seems unlikely both cartridges
<BR>
would have the problem, but not impossible. So, now I want to
<BR>
look at the details of the machine check and I saw a structure
<BR>
entry called &quot;mchk_header-&gt;proc_offset&quot;. My hope is this points
<BR>
to info about which processor had the problem but I can't find 
<BR>
a structure description of what it points to. If someone knows
<BR>
where such a beast is or where docs are that describe it, please
<BR>
let me know. I looked at the 21264 HW reference and didn't find
<BR>
any likely candidates.
<BR>
<P>Any info appreciated.
