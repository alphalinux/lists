<P>
The problem with the Multia stems from the onboard TGA video. It seems SRM
<BR>
looks for the TGA and has problems with installed video cards. Note, this
<BR>
is a Multia/UDB issue. I have SRM running on my other boxes fine with 
<BR>
exotic cards. It's only the Multia and it's SRM that are giving me problems.

<P><P>I, until recently, had an S3 installed on my system.  While I never had to
<BR>
use
<BR>
the console (I don't have a serial terminal), I do boot from SRM.  This is
<BR>
on
<BR>
a PWS 433au (Miata).  I'm not certain what the problem might be.  SRM always
<BR>
came up and I could do whatever I wanted in it to boot or whatever.
