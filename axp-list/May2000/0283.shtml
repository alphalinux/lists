Peter,
<BR>
<P>Thanks for posting this as it reminded me I needed to post the solution
<BR>
to a problem I was having.
<BR>
<P>Until recently, I had a similar situation with my 164LX and a Soundblaster
<BR>
Awe64 card.  I'm using MILO, not SRM, as I still need to boot to NT.
<BR>
Anyhow, I've been compiling Xmame with the Compaq C compiler and having
<BR>
odd sound problems.  I was getting terrible stucking noises or it just
<BR>
wouldn't work at all.  The KDE sounds were not much better.  Updating the
<BR>
kernel to 2.2.15 didn't help either.  About a week ago I took a long shot
<BR>
and I built a updated MILO against a 2.2.15 kernel (Thanks, Stefan!) and
<BR>
then it started working...!  :-)
