<EM>&gt; &gt; Yay!  It works.  For a moment I was worried I'd have to go back to MILO,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or cripple my X server... that Voodoo3 sure is *fast* on 4.0.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By &quot;cripple&quot;, you mean recompile it so that it doesn't use the MVI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instructions? I hardly think that you'd notice any speed difference;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how often do you think those instructions are generated by GCC?
</EM><BR>
<P>hmm... good point.  It looks like GCC generates such instructions when
<BR>
comparing bytes or words, to save one instruction and one register. 
<BR>
Probably not much of a gain.
<BR>
<P>I had at first naively assumed there were MVI instructions in XFree86
<BR>
for a reason, i.e. hand coded.  So what good is MVI after all?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Be that as it may, I've been told that version 5.8 of SRM will have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the MVI instructions enabled. It's possible that there may be an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interim version of 5.7 which does also, but no promises, as I have no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; control over it's production. If such should come to pass, I'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; announce availability on this list (at least).
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, it's encouraging that Compaq is still maintaining SRM for a dead
<BR>
machine.
