<P>
<EM>&gt; If compaq really wants to win over linux users, they should add high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quality optimization for alpha directly into gcc.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's easier said than done. Compaq's compilers use a completely different
<BR>
(and apparently more powerful) intermediate representation, so the things
<BR>
they do in ccc aren't directly applicable to gcc.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'd hate to see compaq/alpha squander the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; potential gains it could make in linux mind share by not fully
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supporting open source tools.
</EM><BR>
<P>Compaq supports AlphaLinux in a major way. Compaq has open-sourced some
<BR>
other tools for AlphaLinux, such as some performance tools. I'm working with
<BR>
Compaq guys on page coloring for Linux. And everyone was pleasantly
<BR>
surprised when they made their compiler free-as-in-beer for enthusiasts. You
<BR>
should give them credit where credit is due, and not focus on one area too
<BR>
much.
<BR>
<P>I would like to see Compaq make additional investment in open source, but
<BR>
the top 2 areas I see for AlphaLinux are (1) making sure that ethernet
<BR>
drivers for Linux work on their motherboard ethernet chips before the
<BR>
motherboards come out, and (2) helping Cygnus with some of the outstanding
<BR>
binutils problems for AlphaLinux, namely the restrictions on .got sections
<BR>
that make big programs hard to link.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; (I do appreciate their releasing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free-as-in-beer compilers!  It just seems that there is a lot of code
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; duplication in maintaining separate compilers rather than beefing up the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alpha code generation in gcc.)
</EM><BR>
<P>It's just not that simple. Compaq wrote that compiler for VMS, Tru64, and
<BR>
x86/NT. That's what paid for overall development, and the improvements that
<BR>
are still going on. The port to Linux was fairly inexpensive. An identical
<BR>
amount of money spent on gcc would probably not improve it much.
<BR>
<P>Additionally, my business involves selling Alphas for high performance
<BR>
computing, and for that I need a good Fortran 95 compiler. Compaq supports
<BR>
F95 in their compiler; no amount of love or money will make GNU F95 be
<BR>
finished tomorrow. It's nicely underway, but...
<BR>
<P>Changing topics: I wonder if anyone is thinking about writing an Alpha
<BR>
back-end for SGI's open source compiler? It has a free IA-64 backend; SGI
<BR>
has not released the mips back-end. It should be possible to do an alpha
<BR>
back-end, but it would be a fair bit of work.
