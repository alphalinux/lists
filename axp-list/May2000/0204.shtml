<P>
I have an AlphaPC LX164, and last night I was remotely logged in doing
<BR>
some work, and it suddenly disconnected me, and I couldn't ping it
<BR>
anymore.  When I got home, I found that it had crashed.  I turned the
<BR>
power off and back on, and there was no signal on the monitor - the hard
<BR>
drive spun up, the keyboard lights blinked normally, but no signal came
<BR>
onto the monitor and the machine never booted up.
<BR>
<P>This has happened intermittedly before, but all I had to do before was
<BR>
jiggle things around inside and it would work fine.  I've been trying to
<BR>
get it to boot up for an hour now with no luck.
<BR>
<P>Has anybody heard of anything like this happening before?
<BR>
<P>Thanks
