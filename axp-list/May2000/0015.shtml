Hello Everyone:
<BR>
<P>Compaq released the beta of their C++ compiler a while ago which to my
<BR>
surprise didn't get much attention on the list. I'm curious if anyone is
<BR>
using it, what the general opinion of it is,  and if anyone has any
<BR>
&quot;success stories&quot; they would like to share.
<BR>
<P><P>&lt;You can stop reading here if you don't want to read my story&gt;
<BR>
<P><P>I had a bit of scientific code handed down to me which I've been trying
<BR>
to understand and optimize for the last few weeks.  With GCC (and the
<BR>
best combination of flags I could find) the runtime was about 40 minutes.
<BR>
With CXX and the '-fast' flag, the runtime was reduced to 3 minutes on the
<BR>
same machine (DP264) yielding nearly identical results!
<BR>
<P>So, I got lucky and CXX picked up something GCC missed.  In some of our
<BR>
other well written programs were not seeing significant performance
<BR>
differences.
<BR>
<P>I'm curious about other people's experiences and general impressions. What
<BR>
do you think of CXX?
<BR>
<P><P>Thanks -
<BR>
<P>Blake
