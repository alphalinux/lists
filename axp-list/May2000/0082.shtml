<P>
Right, a friend is after discovering two Alpha based boards in his
<BR>
cupboard. They seem to be MIATA's (at least there's a reasonably long
<BR>
string with MIATA at the end silk screened on them, and they
<BR>
fit with the descriptions on the site).
<BR>
<P>These seem to need specific chassis's (which look/sound very similar
<BR>
to the Digital Celebris Dual PII-233's that I have in work)...
<BR>
<P>any ideas where to get them, or is it possible to just use a standard
<BR>
ATX Power Supply and rig up a case for it?
<BR>
<P>Also, I have a UX board from samsung. Any ideas if swapping the processors
<BR>
is possible (I want to run FreeBSD/OpenBSD or at least try them, which
<BR>
I can't do on my ruffian).
<BR>
<P>Regards
<BR>
L.
