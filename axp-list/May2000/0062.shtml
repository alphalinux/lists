<P><EM>&gt; What I hope for:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hardware: at least 256 MB RAM, at least two drives, preferably SCSI, with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software mirroring (RAID?), so that I can just swap drives in the event
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of a failure. Tape backup, too. CPU fast enough to stand up to multiple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; domains using Perl, PHP, and SQL.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Software I want to run: Apache web server and Redhat or other SSL web
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; server, Perl, PHP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, POP, IMAP, Sendmail or similar,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; FTP, Secure Shell, PGP. (ASP if I can become convinced it won't choke my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machine or open security holes).
</EM><BR>
<P>All of the above sounds fine to me. It's all pretty generic (non-Alpha)
<BR>
questions. Don't run ASP.. unless you have to. It has more security
<BR>
holes then I have fingers and toes. ;-)

<P><EM>&gt; DEC4000 model 610 -- Big monster with tons of RAM, 6 SCSI drives and bays
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for 10 more drives, DAT and DLT tapes. Attractive because it is very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complete with lot's of room to grow, but possibly an ancient model,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; either slow or or not usable with linux?
</EM><BR>
<P>These do not currently run Linux. They will run NetBSD (to some degree).
<BR>
These systems are the oldest Alphas and do not use PCI or ISA bus.
<BR>
Basically they are very old and slow, but still hard working machines. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Alpha Server 2000 P233 -- A complete system, with drives and tape backup,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but I don't know how fast it is or if it will boot linux.
</EM><BR>
<P>If it is a AS2000 233, it is 233MHz. These will run Linux, but it is
<BR>
pretty old. It would probably be about the same as a 200MHz Pentium at
<BR>
Integer and about a 300MHz Pentium at Floating point.   
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Alpha 21164SX 533 MHz Server -- A nice complete system, but has a single
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; EIDE drive rather than multiple SCSI. Can SCSI be added for a reasonable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; price?
</EM><BR>
<P>The 164SX (uses 21164PC processor) is a stripped version of the standard
<BR>
21164. While a desent system it has little room to grow. More ideal for
<BR>
a personal workstation. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; AlphaServer 3300R -- This looks like a real nice one. No Hard drives and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not enough RAM, but that can be fixed.
</EM><BR>
<P>The &quot;R&quot; at the end of the model number means it is the rackmount model. 
<BR>
Out of the systems you listed I would probably  go with this one. I must 
<BR>
point out that this is &quot;white box&quot; system, which  was originally meant to 
<BR>
run NT. There have been a few people recently asking how to install Linux 
<BR>
on these. Try checking the list archives (available from alphalinux.org) 
<BR>
to make sure it is fully Linux compatible before buying. 
<BR>
<P>Hope that helps.
