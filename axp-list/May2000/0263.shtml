<EM>&gt; very curios. I have the problem with the driver INSIDE the kernel and now

<EM>&gt; I am trying with the driver AS A MODULE.. Very funny.

<EM>&gt; Which kind of problems had you ???

<EM>&gt; Had you to modify some SRM parameters ??

<P>I know I set the proper duplex and speed at the SRM prompt, if you
<BR>
don't you can seriously mess up you network if it isn't switched. :)
<BR>
The problems I was seeing were with the network mysteriously stopping.
<BR>
I would then have to unload the module and load it again to get it to
<BR>
work.  This of course was unacceptable.  It may have been that I
<BR>
upgraded the kernel and the problems went away, I wasn't very
<BR>
scientific about it and I wasn't the only one working on the problem
<BR>
off and on.  I just know that I haven't really had any problems in a
<BR>
while and it was pretty much about the time we compiled the driver
<BR>
into the kernel.
