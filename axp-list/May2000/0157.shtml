<P>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; My guess is that compiler sales generate very little revenue for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; most hardware companies (anyone have data?) and so the mind share benefits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; of supporting free software far outweigh any potential profits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; from selling closed source tools.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   This is not the way Compaq is organized -- I believe that the compiler group
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   is supposed to be self-supporting. That's why it's really good that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Linux port was cheap, or it wouldn't have happened.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
This is also the reason why it costs roughly $500 MORE for the SRM version
<BR>
of an Alpha OEM motherboard than for the ARC version.
<BR>
<P>Compaq, like most other large companies is organized to actually make a
<BR>
profit -- unlike .coms. In a large company it is very difficult to &quot;weed
<BR>
out&quot; the parts that are causing the overall corporate profits to decline or
<BR>
fail to grow without some kind of &quot;cost center&quot; structure. Hence individual
<BR>
departments are frequently &quot;cost centers&quot; and they are required to &quot;sell&quot;
<BR>
their services to other corporate departments in-order to receive money for
<BR>
salaries and the like. Move up the food chain from department to division
<BR>
and, yes, the division head can choose to make his division &quot;less
<BR>
profitable&quot; by subsidizing those parts which are necessary but unpopular.
<BR>
<P>In Academia, we call this &quot;subvention&quot; and it allows things like the
<BR>
Folklore or Latin departments to continue to exist even when they have a 2
<BR>
or 3 faculty members to each student! But it means that the Engineering
<BR>
School and the Business School can't hire the faculty needed to lower their
<BR>
student faculty ratios from 50-100 to 1 to 20-30 to 1.
<BR>
<P>It is only in Government where the Civil-Service system guarantees
<BR>
employment for life (yes, more tenured faculty members are fired each year 
<BR>
than Civil Service employees) that the notion of accountability for
<BR>
generating enough income to pay your own salary is a novel concept.
<BR>
<P>Research Professors are expected to obtain sufficient Grant funds to cover
<BR>
salaries and related costs -- including the &quot;tax&quot; which a University of Lab
<BR>
puts on that grant to fund the &quot;central facilities&quot; -- like the Library,
<BR>
and the OC3 Internet 2 connection.
<BR>
<P>=== 
<BR>
The real problem with Linux and the Alpha is that the two come from
<BR>
different worlds. Linux comes from the PC world and Alpha comes from the
<BR>
Enterprise. 
<BR>
<P>The Linux program within Compaq is funded by the Tru64 Unix side of the
<BR>
house where Maddog campaigned heavily and long for it. (Read June's Linux
<BR>
Journal if you want the details.) It is driven and funded out of the
<BR>
Enterprise computing division (ie the Alpha side). Why? because the
<BR>
&quot;Industry Standard Server&quot; folks (ie the PC side) don't have to try to sell
<BR>
PCs... they just take orders, and they have tied their fortunes to
<BR>
Microsoft. 
<BR>
<P>The future of Tru64 and of VMS is tied to the success of the Alpha. 
<BR>
That's why you can run Alpha Linux on the GS160, and why there is binary 
<BR>
compatibility between Tru64 Unix and Alpha Linux. 
<BR>
<P>Without Kurt's instigation, Maddog's vision and Digital/Compaq's direct
<BR>
support of Linux on the Alpha -- it simply would not exist. All you would
<BR>
have available to you today is Linux on Intel. 
<BR>
<P>[I followed Kurt and became the last chair of the UNIX-SIG in DECUS.]
<BR>
<P>The sad commentary about the Linux community is that &quot;linux&quot; to 99% of them
<BR>
means &quot;Linux on Intel.&quot; Linux on Alpha is denigrated just like the
<BR>
Macintosh is denigrated by Windows users.
