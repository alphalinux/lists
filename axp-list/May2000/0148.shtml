<P><EM>&gt; Well gcc does have some problems that are hard to overcome.  I believe at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; least some people from compaq have been helping with gcc, but I think a better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solution is to have the gcc front end hooked up to the GEM backend(GEM is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually the optimization core of all the compaq compilers.  Basically all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compilers for WinNT, VMS, and Tru64 represent an intermediate format to GEM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which does the optimization and finalization).
</EM><BR>
<P>This would be perfect, particularly if something similar could be done for g77.
<BR>
As long as the pricing is not prohibitive, GNU/Linux compatibility is more
<BR>
important from my perspective than either open source or free beer.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Also I would be interested in what high quality optimization intel is doing for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; GCC.  I believe that if you compare irc to gcc you will see a large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difference as well.
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe that intel funded cygnus to improve the pentium optimizations in gcc
<BR>
and these have or will be folded into the main gcc source.  (At least that is the
<BR>
impression I got from some of the cygnus cold fusion press releases.)  It also
<BR>
sounds like they are putting a lot of resources into GNU/Linux support for IA-64.
<BR>
<P>Still, I'm a big fan of Alpha hardware and plan on spending a fair chunk of
<BR>
startup money on a small Alpha cluster next year.  On the other hand, if someone
<BR>
ever does manages to get close to Alpha in floating point performance and
<BR>
throughput at comparable hardware cost, AND supports high performance GNU/Linux
<BR>
tools, then I will reconsider.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
