<P>
As long as both fans are running and not obstructed by cables, etc, you
<BR>
should be fine.  These systems are spec'd to run at 35C ambient.  That means
<BR>
that we test them in a thermal chamber at a significantly higher temperature
<BR>
(42? 45?) as well as testing them in the corners of the
<BR>
temperature/voltage/frequency graph.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, if the reason things are hot is that you've run your SCSI
<BR>
cable across the mouth of the fan, then you should move it. :-)
<BR>
<P>As far as the discussion concerning heat and electrical consumption goes
<BR>
(but remember students, heat != temperature), the power supplies used in the
<BR>
CH320 are 70-80% efficient.  That means that a system that wants 400W will
<BR>
have already dissipated 133W (400*(.75/1-1)) in the power supply before
<BR>
anything gets to the motherboard.
<BR>
<P>It's 3.42 BTU per watt and 12,000 BTU per ton of A/C.  Depending on your
<BR>
configuration and how hard you are running them, you'll need an additional
<BR>
ton of cooling for each 4 to 12 or more systems depending on whether you are
<BR>
running your dual 1 GHz maxed configurations flat out all the time or have
<BR>
uniprocessor 667 MHz systems just loafing along.
<BR>
<P>Tom
<BR>
<P>P.S.  Like many systems these cool front to back.  So line them up in racks
<BR>
with the fronts of adjacent rows facing each other and the backs facing the
<BR>
backs of the row behind.  That way you aren't blowing hot outlet air into
<BR>
the intakes of the next row.

<EM>&gt; Hi there,

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have an new UP2000 (Dual 21264 750 MHz) there and I am wondering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that it is getting really hot (at the side near the CPU location). I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; estimate 40 - 50 °C (degree centigrade) but haven't measured it yet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What are the experiences with UP2000 temperature ? What should be the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; output of lm_sensors - based meters ?
