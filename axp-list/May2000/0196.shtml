Video is tricky on the Jensen. The firmware only recognizes a very small
<BR>
set of cards. The list includes the EISA Qvision (though no XFree86 server
<BR>
supports this so that excludes Linux), and certain ISA S3-based cards
<BR>
(though
<BR>
not all of these work!). I could not get my S3 card to run in anything over
<BR>
8-bit depth though. XFree86-4.0 *should* allow you to run with more ISA
<BR>
cards
<BR>
since the Jensen's support code has been merged into the SVGA tree (S3
<BR>
server 
<BR>
is gone in 4.0 IIRC). But I doubt that will help since the firware will
<BR>
still
<BR>
limit you. Good luck!

<P><P>Hi,
<BR>
I've just recently gotten my Jensen running with Linux,
<BR>
by using the kernel available from:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://tuddv2.ced.tudelft.nl/">http://tuddv2.ced.tudelft.nl/</A>
<BR>
(Thank you for making this page available)
<BR>
The specific one i used was:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://tuddv2.ced.tudelft.nl/jensen/redhat/6.2/images/jensen-2.2.15-boot.img">http://tuddv2.ced.tudelft.nl/jensen/redhat/6.2/images/jensen-2.2.15-boot.img</A>
<BR>
<P>This is a raw disk image and needs to be put on a floppy using
<BR>
something like rawrite for DOS, or similar.
<BR>
There is one thing i've done differently from most other people,
<BR>
i didn't put a ramdisk image on floppy.
<BR>
instead at the aboot prompt i used the command;
<BR>
<EM>aboot&gt; 0/a root=/dev/scd0 load_ramdisk=1
</EM><BR>
This was using Redhat 6.1
<BR>
after that the install went pretty smoothly, i tried the same procedure
<BR>
with Redhat 6.2, but this failed partway through the installation.
<BR>
<P>I've got a couple of questions for the list;
<BR>
Where can i get the latest patches for 2.2.15?
<BR>
I understand that its possible to build a 2.2.15-2.50 kernel.
<BR>
Also how about X?
<BR>
Are there any specific patches for the Jensen? I have an ISA card using an
<BR>
S3 801 chip, however the X server off the Redhat 6.1 doesn't work for me.
<BR>
When i try to fire it up i get a screen full of random pixels, although the
<BR>
machine doesn't crash, and i can still telnet into the jensen, the video
<BR>
card
<BR>
appears to be 'locked' into this mode until i power cycle the machine.
<BR>
Thanx
<BR>

<EM>&gt;Hi guys,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I know this has been discussed before, but I can't get the f**king thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;working.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I've got this old Jensen, got it formatted, copyboot ok, boots ok, then
</EM><BR>
gets
<BR>
<EM>&gt;to the ramdisk part, and I can't get past that, i've tried version  6.0,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;6.2, 4.2, 5.0, 5.2, and a few others, tried different computers writing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disk, changed floppy disks so many times, changed the floppy drives, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;still no joy. I just get:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;end_request: I/O error, dev 01:00, sector 7xxx - 8190
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and nothing else. I'm getting really frustated with this, I even had OSF,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(Digital UNIX) on it for a while because I couldn't get it working this far
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;before. So any help you can give, please, please help me
</EM><BR>
