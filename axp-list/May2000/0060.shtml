<P>
I run a small web-hosting and development company, and I am considering
<BR>
building my new web server using Alpha hardware and linux.
<BR>
<P>My current server is an Intel clone AMD K6, running RedHat 5.2, and is
<BR>
chugging along nicely with about 50 domains (admittedly, some of these
<BR>
are very small, not very active web sites). I figure I'm OK for a while,
<BR>
but I want my next server to be good enough to host 400 or 500 sites if
<BR>
possible.
<BR>
<P>I've been looking at several AlphaServers on eBay that look like
<BR>
possibilities, but I don't know what's a good model for installing Linux.
<BR>
Some of the descriptions are a bit short on detail, and I often can't
<BR>
find exactly what they describe in the Digital web site's Retired
<BR>
AlphaServer section.
<BR>
<P>If anyone can comment on the various models available and problems or
<BR>
benefits with running linux on any of them, I'd greatly appreciate it.
<BR>
<P>What I hope for:
<BR>
Hardware: at least 256 MB RAM, at least two drives, preferably SCSI, with
<BR>
software mirroring (RAID?), so that I can just swap drives in the event
<BR>
of a failure. Tape backup, too. CPU fast enough to stand up to multiple
<BR>
domains using Perl, PHP, and SQL.
<BR>
<P>Software I want to run: Apache web server and Redhat or other SSL web
<BR>
server, Perl, PHP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, POP, IMAP, Sendmail or similar,
<BR>
FTP, Secure Shell, PGP. (ASP if I can become convinced it won't choke my
<BR>
machine or open security holes).
<BR>
<P>The auctions that look like possibilities are:
<BR>
<P>DEC4000 model 610 -- Big monster with tons of RAM, 6 SCSI drives and bays
<BR>
for 10 more drives, DAT and DLT tapes. Attractive because it is very
<BR>
complete with lot's of room to grow, but possibly an ancient model,
<BR>
either slow or or not usable with linux?
<BR>
<P>Alpha Server 2000 P233 -- A complete system, with drives and tape backup,
<BR>
but I don't know how fast it is or if it will boot linux.
<BR>
<P>Alpha 21164SX 533 MHz Server -- A nice complete system, but has a single
<BR>
EIDE drive rather than multiple SCSI. Can SCSI be added for a reasonable
<BR>
price?
<BR>
<P>AlphaServer 3300R -- This looks like a real nice one. No Hard drives and
<BR>
not enough RAM, but that can be fixed.
<BR>
<P>Any advice you can give me would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
<BR>
