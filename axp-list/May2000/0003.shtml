<P>
I tried your suggestion and it didn't help me at all.  It appears that
<BR>
everything is just hanging in the install once I enter the root passwords.
<BR>
<P>My next attempt was to download the iso image for Mandrake70 in the hopes
<BR>
that the installer would work better.  They have an image called &quot;cdrom.img&quot;
<BR>
to boot with as well as instructions for booting from the CD itself.  When I
<BR>
try either of those I get a halt in SRM before the system fully boots.
<BR>
<P>Has anyone actually installed Linux on an AXP150?  If so, what distribution
<BR>
and version and how the heck did you do it?  I've looked at the instructions
<BR>
I've been able to find on the net and have, as far as I can tell, followed
<BR>
them completely but to no avail.  As I have been working with Unix of one
<BR>
flavor or another since the 1970's I'm not new to this stuff, but this $20
<BR>
Jensen of mine is driving me nuts.
<BR>
<P>Thanks much,
<BR>

<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; The other interesting thing is that if I go to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the console on Alt-F2 I get a bash prompt, the Alt-F3 console tells me
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;auto-partioning&quot; has failed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In that case why you will not use the second console and fdisk to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; partition your disk?  Once you did that reboot and start the whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installation again but do not create a new partition table - just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;edit&quot; assignments.  Then, at least, you will take &quot;auto-partitioning&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out of the picture.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DiskDruid always looked to me as a very fragile piece of sofware.
