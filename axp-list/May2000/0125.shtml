<P>
The biggest hiccup I remember (when installing 6.1) was related to a bug
<BR>
in fdisk (does anyone know if this is fixed???) where you need to stay
<BR>
one block from the end of the disk to avoid an issue with the data spilling
<BR>
onto the first block. Once I got past this I had to boot in single user
<BR>
mode to avoid problems with awk. 
<BR>
<P>I don't remember getting an I/O error like your getting though. :-(

Subject: Need help with a Jensen
<BR>
<P><P>Hi guys,
<BR>
<P>I know this has been discussed before, but I can't get the f**king thing
<BR>
working.
<BR>
I've got this old Jensen, got it formatted, copyboot ok, boots ok, then gets
<BR>
to the ramdisk part, and I can't get past that, i've tried version  6.0,
<BR>
6.2, 4.2, 5.0, 5.2, and a few others, tried different computers writing the
<BR>
disk, changed floppy disks so many times, changed the floppy drives, but
<BR>
still no joy. I just get:
<BR>
<P>end_request: I/O error, dev 01:00, sector 7xxx - 8190
<BR>
<P>and nothing else. I'm getting really frustated with this, I even had OSF,
<BR>
(Digital UNIX) on it for a while because I couldn't get it working this far
<BR>
before. So any help you can give, please, please help me
<BR>
<P>Graeme Hogg
