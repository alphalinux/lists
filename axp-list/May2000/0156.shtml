<EM>&gt;   &gt; What type of architecture is in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; DEC ALPHA 3305?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; Will this machine run Linux?   Tru64Unix?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   I just got a 3300R this week and am beginning the process of installing an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   OS and setting it up. So far it looks great. It'a very heavy-duty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   professional server. The memory is a little pricey (about $2/Mb EDO ECC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   DIMMs). It's still available -- it's used in high-end servers like these.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   You need to install the DIMMs in sets of FOUR (256-bit data path!). SCSI is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Ultra-Wide and used standard 80-pin SCA2 hot-swap drives. You can also add
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   regular 50-pin or 68-pin SCSI drives.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   I don't know for a fact, but I think Tru64 is a no-go on these. There was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   some mail this week and last on the FreeBSD-Alpha list about possible boot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   problems with the 3300s. I'm not sure how that panned out.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe that the 3300 series boxes are the ones which were &quot;bastardized&quot;
<BR>
for NT. That is to say, it was a Marketing decision (not Engineering) to
<BR>
PREVENT any operating system other than NT (read VMS and Tru64) from
<BR>
running on the box. Compaq sold them at about half the price of the
<BR>
comparable box capable of running VMS and Tru64. But other than the &quot;NT
<BR>
only&quot; designation there was no difference from the VMS and Tru64 capable
<BR>
boxes. 
<BR>
<P>As I recall, the primary issue is that the 3300 series has no SRM console;
<BR>
it has the ARC console only.
<BR>
I don't believe that there was ever any &quot;check the processor type and
<BR>
abort&quot; code created -- since without the SRM console neither VMS nor Tru64
<BR>
can be booted. 
<BR>
<P>The full details are in the tru64-unix-managers archives, it's been
<BR>
discussed several times since Compaq dropped NT on the Alpha and these
<BR>
boxes became available -- cheap -- because they have no &quot;supported&quot; OS.
