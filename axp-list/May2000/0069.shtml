</EM><BR>
<P>software raid works. Hardware raid is also available, take a look at the

DAC960.

&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Software I want to run: Apache web server and Redhat or other SSL web
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; server, Perl, PHP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, POP, IMAP, Sendmail or similar,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; FTP, Secure Shell, PGP. (ASP if I can become convinced it won't choke my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machine or open security holes).
</EM><BR>
<P>thats all supported you're just going to have to do alot of compiling. I
<BR>
wouldnt bother with ASP if you're already using PHP. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The auctions that look like possibilities are:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DEC4000 model 610 -- Big monster with tons of RAM, 6 SCSI drives and bays
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for 10 more drives, DAT and DLT tapes. Attractive because it is very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complete with lot's of room to grow, but possibly an ancient model,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; either slow or or not usable with linux?
</EM><BR>
<P>Old system. It looks like a turbochannel and thus is unsupported by
<BR>
Linux. Also compared to the rest of them it's quite slow.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Alpha Server 2000 P233 -- A complete system, with drives and tape backup,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but I don't know how fast it is or if it will boot linux.
</EM><BR>
<P>It looks like a sable and there are sable variations that are supported
<BR>
but im not sure about this one. It's not a very fast system though i
<BR>
believe it is SMP.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Alpha 21164SX 533 MHz Server -- A nice complete system, but has a single
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; EIDE drive rather than multiple SCSI. Can SCSI be added for a reasonable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; price?
</EM><BR>
<P>yeah but you'll spend the same money bidding on the AS3300R and that
<BR>
already has scsi and alot of other things
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; AlphaServer 3300R -- This looks like a real nice one. No Hard drives and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not enough RAM, but that can be fixed.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a sure thing. it has lots of memory bandwidth unlike the SX. Not
<BR>
to mention the 4 bay hotswap and it's a rack so you have room to
<BR>
grow. They usally go for around $500 on ebay, a steal for a server that
<BR>
has a cross bar switched memory architecture. They run Linux great with
<BR>
two cavets.You have to use atleast kernel 2.2.14 and it must be compiled
<BR>
as generic.it has SRM available, same thing as a AS800 but a white box.
<BR>
Also this is new in box so all you have to do is send in the warrenty card
<BR>
you get 3 years onsite from Q.
