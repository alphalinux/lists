<EM>&gt; &quot;Updated Chipset Support What's a new release of XFree86 without support
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for some new chipsets?  4.1.0 features support for not only new cards, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also strengthens the support for some cards. It also seems that a lot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time, the Alpha platform gets ignored along with the *BSDs, but this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; version changes that.  With 4.1.0, Linux/PPC finally has DRI support,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; FreeBSD has i810/i815 support, and Alpha/Linux finally has jumped on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bandwagon with support for the ATI Radeon.&quot;

<P>Yes, it *was* nice to see Alpha mentioned, even though he didn't test
<BR>
it... ;-}
<BR>
<P>Regardless, the notable things related to Alpha in 4.1.0 are:
<BR>
<P>1. 3DFx card 3D support is *much* quicker than before. I tested Banshee
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Voodoo3 3000 PCI cards on both EV56/PYXIS and EV6 machines
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and had good results. 
<BR>
<P>2. ATI Rage 128 PCI and Radeon PCI now support 3D operation via PCI-GART
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hardware on the cards. Again, tested on both EV56/PYXIS and EV6 based
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;machines, with very nice results.
<BR>
<P>3. support for Matrox Millenniums and Permedia 2/2v should now be working
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again on the older (non-EV6) machines.
<BR>
<P>4. TGA support now includes TGA2 support, both 8 and 24 bit cards.
<BR>
<P>5. Permedia 3 (VX1) PCI 2D-only support, seems to work on most boxes.
<BR>
<P>Note that other/older machines may have significant problems trying
<BR>
with 3DFx/Rage128/Radeon, related to inability of the consoles' BIOS
<BR>
emulation to work on the card, or the requirement for SPARSE access.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, there were some of my patches that got left out due to
<BR>
time or testing constraints, among them being reduction of the
<BR>
memory/swap requirements for the Xserver process on Alpha machines
<BR>
requiring SPARSE access.  This is especially important for those older
<BR>
machines with small memory configurations.
<BR>
<P>These patches will be available soon; I'll post an announcement on
<BR>
this list (among other places).
<BR>
<P>Enjoy! We now have 3 cards that'll do 3D stuff on our PCI Alphas... :-)
