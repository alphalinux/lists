<P>
<EM>&gt; If someone knows who to best go through to get changes made to the kernel,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; please please let me know.  I have enough time to fix quite a few things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in there for Alpha, but usually don't since I can't seem to get even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the simplest changes integrated in upstream.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree, 
<BR>
It was my hobby like thing, reporting bugs and fixes but not anymore.
<BR>
I think get accepted or not is depend on their taste and I feel bad about
<BR>
that.
<BR>
These days, even worse, It's hard to get reponse.
<BR>
I found that my last patch, kernel_execve(), was finally reported by Mr.
<BR>
jaggerman,(sorry if name is incorrect)
<BR>
after long period of time. I would rather report any bugs and fixes to him 
<BR>
<P>Is it true that any kind of kernel debugger is not included in linux because
<BR>
linus doesn't like kdb?
<BR>
<P>Soohoon.
