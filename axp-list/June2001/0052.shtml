Hi,
<BR>
<P>So happened that I dug out a old 164LX board that had been discarded a
<BR>
while back, and thinking why, plugged a vid card in and much to my
<BR>
surprise the board booted.
<BR>
<P>This board seems to have some strange bugs. As I am no Alpha expert (in
<BR>
fact, it's my first non-x86 comp I have mettled with to such a large
<BR>
extent), I cannot tell if those  problems can be fixed with a simple
<BR>
patch or flash or must I forget the idea of using a 64-bit computer...
<BR>
<P>First, booting a floppy from SRM sometimes succeeds, sometimes fails
<BR>
crashing after telling me that it's bootstrapping. No ideas why.
<BR>
<P>Second, I tried to use MILO by flashing AlphaBIOS, but the comp seems to
<BR>
'forget' it and next time it boots SRM is back. Might it be the failsafe
<BR>
as, honestly, I haven't plugged the speaker in? And if it is, how to fix
<BR>
it?
<BR>
<P>Somehow, I got Red Hat 7.0 installed, and stupid as I am on DOS
<BR>
partitions. Can't RH be booted from DOS partitions at all?
<BR>
<P><P>Sorry if I missed some technical information that is needed.
<BR>
<P><P>Andri,
<BR>
trying to get his first Alpha experience
