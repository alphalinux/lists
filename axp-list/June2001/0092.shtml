<P><EM>&gt; Red Hat and SuSE dominate in the commercial distribution market for Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As such they are good starting points, but it is never a bad thing to see 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what the major updates are for this, as with any platform.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are quite a few other smaller and derivative distributions, ranging 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from Debian to other commercial endeavors.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not going to start a flamewar here, although it would be easy for me
<BR>
to do so :-)  To answer the question more directly, RedHat does have an
<BR>
Alpha distribution, as do SuSE, Debian, and Slackware.  My advice: use the
<BR>
distribution that you're most familiar with.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;2. How compatible are 7300's? I'd especially like to hear from someone who's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;already installed Linux on a 7300 (4100 with DEC marketroid braindamage, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Paul from COLA put it).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Many people have successfully installed on that platform.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is very true.  The Rawhide family is supported by the kernel and has
<BR>
been for some time.  BTW, I like the &quot;marketroid braindamage&quot; snippet
<BR>
above:-P
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; An Alpha running Linux is as capable as an x86 in the typical server 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; functions. i.e.: Samba, Sendmail, and so on. As such the Alpha platforms 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a good history of reliability, and excellent bandwidth and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; characteristics under load.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've seen quite a few older Alpha systems perform extremely well under
<BR>
heavier web service loads (an old Miata that I know of actually withstood
<BR>
the Slashdot effect quite handily).  Newer Alphas obviously tend to handle
<BR>
the load even better. Mail handling performance is quite
<BR>
good as well, in my experience (I've used exim and qmail, but sendmail
<BR>
should perform well also).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Alphalinux.org is the traditional main point, having taken over from the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; predecessor aztarnet site, which still exists, but is no longer 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; significantly updated.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For example:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="ftp://ftp.azstarnet.com/pub/linux/axp/docs/FAQ.html#toc5">ftp://ftp.azstarnet.com/pub/linux/axp/docs/FAQ.html#toc5</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are a few other good points, and they are more than adequately 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; referenced at :
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.alphalinux.org/otherpages/">http://www.alphalinux.org/otherpages/</A>
</EM><BR>
<P>The above is definitely the best sites to hit.  If you want to know more
<BR>
about what other Alpha systems exist (for the curious), you can also hit:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/ports/alpha/sys_types">http://www.debian.org/ports/alpha/sys_types</A>
<BR>
<P>That link lists every Alpha systype that I could find and whether or not
<BR>
it's supported by Linux.
