<EM>&gt; &gt; Does anybody remember the intel product iapx423(I think the prefix may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be wrong). After spending large numbers of Millions of dollars they took
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; what they learned and made it the 286.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's sort-of close but a ways off from actual history.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The iAPX 432 effort started up around or shortly after 1975.  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was a 32-bit ultra-CISC architecture, with _no_ registers at all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The instruction stream was bit-addressed, which required a huge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extractor/rotator in the instruction decoder.  There was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; essentially no assembly language (other than Ada).  Here's a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quote from an Intel publication: &quot;8086 (1978): Intel's new 16-bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; architecture, originally designed to fill the gap while waiting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for completion of the 32-bit iAPX 432 CPU, ...&quot;  The 432 was way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ahead of its time in many ways.  In hindsight, in other ways, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was not on the right track.  The 432 development effort ended
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shortly after 1983.  The 432 effort and various X86 efforts of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the time undoubtedly cross-pollinated.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have one of the few manuals for the 432. We were looking to work with
<BR>
it but it never became a reality. I think they had some protptype
<BR>
silocon running at 200Khz. This was in the days when other processors
<BR>
were running in the 1-4 Mhz range. After the dust settled the Intel
<BR>
sales staff tried to sell us on the 286. If you look at the way the
<BR>
memory is managed and the OS levels are handled you can see a lot of
<BR>
paralles in the 432 design. The 386 is far more true to the OS
<BR>
partitioning scheme.
<BR>
<P>We then moved on to the NS16000 later to become the NS32000. Well where
<BR>
are they now :( It was a nice VAX inspired CPU and a real joy to work
<BR>
with. Still have one in the basement.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; You might actually be thinking of the 80960 architecture.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There's a whole book on the 80960 architecture, if you can find a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; copy.  It is by Glen Myers and Dave Budde.
</EM><BR>
<P>I fell out of touch with what intel was doing when the 960 came along so
<BR>
I did not comment much on it. My feeling was that they wanted to go
<BR>
after the workstation market but could not make a go of it with SUN and
<BR>
MIPS being the big boys in that arena. But that is only my impresson and
<BR>
should not carry much weight.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The first 960 chip was contemporary with the 386, taping out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about 3 months after the 386.  It had originally been designed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with a byte-addressable very CISC instruction set, but it was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changed to a RISC instruction set late in the design after it was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; found that the instruction decoder wouldn't fit on the die (along
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the rest of the design), even at the largest die size that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could be made on the equipment available for the process of that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time.  This first 960 chip had about 1.4X the transistors of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 386 and was rougly 2X as fast.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The second pair of 960 chips were superscalar.  They were roughly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contemporary with the first Pentium (trademark and so on).  They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were (of course) much faster than the first 960 chip.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The 960 architecture was actually a _VERY_ nice 32-bit (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 33-bit) architecture, with four levels of the architecture.  At
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the high end, it was designed to do rather elaborate object-based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capability-based addressing and protection.  At the low end, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; embedded use, it could be done without floating point or address
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; translation of any kind.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The design of the floating point unit from the first 960 chip
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; found its way (with a few tweaks) into the 387 math coprocessor,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and probably heavily influenced the 486's FP unit.  There was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sharing of ideas and some raw technology between the X86 and 960
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; groups over the years.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In about 1991, the Oregon 960 design group was disbanded and many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the engineers worked on the P6 (Pentium Pro).  Some members of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this group had already done the 486DX2 and a few other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proliferation chips.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I worked in the 960 chip design group from 1983 to 1992, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (with no love for the X86 architecture) on the P6 and Pentium 4
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; group until 2000.  I use a UP2000 at home.  I find it sad to see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; superior architectures die for marketing and political reasons.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks for listening to today's history lesson.  :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>The history is interesting. Thanks.
