<P>That's a pretty large assumption! :-)  I wish the folks that apparently
<BR>
&quot;matter&quot; WRT kernel development and patch accepting would take a more
<BR>
active roll towards non-ix86.  I have sent in quite a few patches against
<BR>
several pre-2.4 and 2.4.x kernels but have never seen any of them
<BR>
integrated (nor even acknowledged).  Most of the time, the fixes needed
<BR>
are incredibly minor, but even something as dumb as documentation updates
<BR>
for Alpha-specific stuff in the kernel has been ignored (which I don't
<BR>
understand since there's no possible way that me changing
<BR>
Alpha-option-specific bits in  Documentation/Configure.help would impact
<BR>
ANYONE else).
<BR>
<P>If someone knows who to best go through to get changes made to the kernel,
<BR>
please please let me know.  I have enough time to fix quite a few things
<BR>
in there for Alpha, but usually don't since I can't seem to get even
<BR>
the simplest changes integrated in upstream.
