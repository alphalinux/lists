<P>
With regards to your message at 06:00 PM 6/20/01, M. Osten. Where you stated:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Ah.. OK, &quot;cheap&quot; gigabit cards..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; OK, they are cheap.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Good luck!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I asked you to quantify your statement that these cards are inferior.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Do you have anything to back up your statement, or are you just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;trolling?
</EM><BR>
Well, without going on at length, only 2 things:
<BR>
1) I too have not heard of anyone having much success with these.
<BR>
2) All of the &quot;cheap&quot; cards I have seen are substantially slower than the 
<BR>
&quot;expensive&quot; ones.
<BR>
3) Software transports are often as much of a problem as the hardware itself.
<BR>
Wes mentioned ftp limitations. I have also seen similar limits on NFS2, but 
<BR>
many people report better results under NFS3.
<BR>
4) We have many customers who started with &quot;cheap&quot; cards and then migrated 
<BR>
to &quot;expensive&quot; cards and were much happier.
<BR>
<P>So, have I run comparative benchmarking between them? No.
<BR>
<P>But a lot of anecdotal evidence from customers and other users suggest that 
<BR>
in these, as in so many things , you get what you pay for..
<BR>
<P>BTW, sorry, I apologize if my previous message sounded insulting to you. I 
<BR>
admit to being a bit bitter on the subject of NICs.
<BR>
<P>I hate ethernet cards.
<BR>
I just wasted 3 hours today arranging to return some Intel 8460C NICs that 
<BR>
were supposed to be compatible with the 8460B. And then finding a 
<BR>
distributor who still had stock of the 8460B's.
<BR>
They aren't compatible, to say the least.
<BR>
<P><P>
<P>With our best regards,
