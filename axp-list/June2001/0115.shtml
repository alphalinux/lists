I suspect that the reason for the slowdown when adding multiple clients on the P4
<BR>
is the result of very poor context switching performance on that processor.  I did
<BR>
some testing (in an NT environment, but the concept of context-switching remains
<BR>
the same) on a variety of processors, including Athlon, P-III, P-4 and Alpha
<BR>
systems with a memory benchmarking program that I wrote a couple of years back.
<BR>
One particular test stress-tested the ability of the processor to quickly switch
<BR>
back and forth between 2 threads.  The scores were as follows (the actual result
<BR>
is merely an linear index score ie a score of 2.0 is eexactly twice as good as
<BR>
1.0).
<BR>
<P>P4-1400:0.99
<BR>
21264-500:0.82
<BR>
21164-500:0.72
<BR>
PII-Xeon-450:0.80
<BR>
PIII-600:1.07
<BR>
PIII-733(SMP):0.90
<BR>
Athlon-700:1.50
<BR>
<P>The P4 was incredibly fast on bulk memory copies, but the processor stalls
<BR>
horribly on context switching operations which can have more of an impact on &quot;real
<BR>
world&quot; usage of a processor -- depending, of course, the type of applications
<BR>
being run on it.  What is surprising above (or maybe it shouldn't be a surprise
<BR>
since the Athlon inherited much of the Alpha goodness) was just how much faster
<BR>
the Athlon-700 was compared to a 1.4Ghz P4.  It should be noted that the test is
<BR>
very dependent on memory chipset performance, so the test isn't as empirical as I
<BR>
would like since it doesn't follow the &quot;all other things being equal&quot; rule that a
<BR>
good benchmark should.  Darek Mihocka wrote an excellent pair of articles about
<BR>
why the P4 did very poorly in his own set of performance investigations, and they
<BR>
are at:

<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.emulators.com/pentium4_6mo.htm">http://www.emulators.com/pentium4_6mo.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>Darek has his own set of benchmarks too that illustrate that the Athlon 1.2Ghz can
<BR>
be faster (in some cases 2x or even 3x) than the P4-1.5Ghz.  In fact the Athlon
<BR>
beats the P4 in 18 out of 22 tests.

<P><P>Hello.
<BR>
<P>I have a question regarding to the Result of AB
<BR>
<P>1)      P4 system is got the best score with single client, but other scores are
<BR>
not so good compare to Xeon. 
<BR>
<P>Please tell me what is the main reason.
