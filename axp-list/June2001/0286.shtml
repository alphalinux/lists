<P>
if you're comparing alpha to itanium for power usage:
<BR>
<P>-ev68 @833MHz ~67W
<BR>
<P>-Itanium @800MHz ~1KW recomended power supply per processor.
<BR>
<P>you can definately heat more of your house in the winter with an Itanium vs.
<BR>
an Alpha =)

<EM>&gt; Well I guess it it time to reconsider purchasing those UP1500s :(

<P>Not really.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;From my POV the UP1500 is a good buy for 64-bit hardware.  IA-64 isn't
</EM><BR>
ready
<BR>
yet, the compilers and os'es are still immature.  And from what I
<BR>
understand,
<BR>
IA-64 costs considerably more.  I sincerely hope Samsung keeps manufacturing
<BR>
for
<BR>
a while yet.
<BR>
<P>One could argue that the Alpha has outlived its usefulness... 64-bitness is
<BR>
now
<BR>
(almost) mainstream and processor speed is no longer the major computing
<BR>
bottleneck.  SPARC, MIPS and Alpha have all become indistinguishable to some
<BR>
degree.
<BR>
<P>There may be a good market for low-power chips ahead, even in server
<BR>
computing,
<BR>
due to space/power considerations.  But the Alpha isn't a good candidate
<BR>
there. 
<BR>
(I wonder what leaving mine on around the clock has done to my electricity
<BR>
bill...)
