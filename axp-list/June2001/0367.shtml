<EM>&gt; Does anybody remember the intel product iapx423(I think the prefix may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be wrong). After spending large numbers of Millions of dollars they took
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what they learned and made it the 286.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's sort-of close but a ways off from actual history.
<BR>
<P>The iAPX 432 effort started up around or shortly after 1975.  It
<BR>
was a 32-bit ultra-CISC architecture, with _no_ registers at all.
<BR>
The instruction stream was bit-addressed, which required a huge
<BR>
extractor/rotator in the instruction decoder.  There was
<BR>
essentially no assembly language (other than Ada).  Here's a
<BR>
quote from an Intel publication: &quot;8086 (1978): Intel's new 16-bit
<BR>
architecture, originally designed to fill the gap while waiting
<BR>
for completion of the 32-bit iAPX 432 CPU, ...&quot;  The 432 was way
<BR>
ahead of its time in many ways.  In hindsight, in other ways, it
<BR>
was not on the right track.  The 432 development effort ended
<BR>
shortly after 1983.  The 432 effort and various X86 efforts of
<BR>
the time undoubtedly cross-pollinated.
<BR>
<P>You might actually be thinking of the 80960 architecture.
<BR>
There's a whole book on the 80960 architecture, if you can find a
<BR>
copy.  It is by Glen Myers and Dave Budde.
<BR>
<P>The first 960 chip was contemporary with the 386, taping out
<BR>
about 3 months after the 386.  It had originally been designed
<BR>
with a byte-addressable very CISC instruction set, but it was
<BR>
changed to a RISC instruction set late in the design after it was
<BR>
found that the instruction decoder wouldn't fit on the die (along
<BR>
with the rest of the design), even at the largest die size that
<BR>
could be made on the equipment available for the process of that
<BR>
time.  This first 960 chip had about 1.4X the transistors of the
<BR>
386 and was rougly 2X as fast.
<BR>
<P>The second pair of 960 chips were superscalar.  They were roughly
<BR>
contemporary with the first Pentium (trademark and so on).  They
<BR>
were (of course) much faster than the first 960 chip.
<BR>
<P>The 960 architecture was actually a _VERY_ nice 32-bit (and
<BR>
33-bit) architecture, with four levels of the architecture.  At
<BR>
the high end, it was designed to do rather elaborate object-based
<BR>
capability-based addressing and protection.  At the low end, for
<BR>
embedded use, it could be done without floating point or address
<BR>
translation of any kind.
<BR>
<P>The design of the floating point unit from the first 960 chip
<BR>
found its way (with a few tweaks) into the 387 math coprocessor,
<BR>
and probably heavily influenced the 486's FP unit.  There was
<BR>
sharing of ideas and some raw technology between the X86 and 960
<BR>
groups over the years.
<BR>
<P>In about 1991, the Oregon 960 design group was disbanded and many
<BR>
of the engineers worked on the P6 (Pentium Pro).  Some members of
<BR>
this group had already done the 486DX2 and a few other
<BR>
proliferation chips.
<BR>
<P>I worked in the 960 chip design group from 1983 to 1992, then
<BR>
(with no love for the X86 architecture) on the P6 and Pentium 4
<BR>
group until 2000.  I use a UP2000 at home.  I find it sad to see
<BR>
superior architectures die for marketing and political reasons.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for listening to today's history lesson.  :-)
