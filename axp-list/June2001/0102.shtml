<P><EM>&gt;The &quot;marketroid&quot; comment was directed at DEC, not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you Maurice. As you know, the PC Group at DEC came
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;out with &quot;white&quot; Alpha's that would only run NT and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not Tru64 and VMS. This was done for marketing reasons,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or so I was told when I joined that group in 1997. Being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a new person in that group, I held my tongue, but 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;privately, I thought it was a silly idea. However, if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you knew the politics of DEC at the time, there was a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;push from the PC group to lower the cost of Alpha. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;enterprise servers&quot; group said &quot;only if they don't run
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;VMS or Tru64, our cash cows&quot; (that's paraphrased) The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;PC group was kind of forced into it.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a rant over spilled milk, but I have some time to burn
<BR>
right now:
<BR>
<P>I'm sure we all have a lot to say about marketing decisions made by
<BR>
DEC, as far back as the VAX-750.  Talk about shooting themselves in
<BR>
the foot competing in the industry.  While SUN was trying to be as
<BR>
aggressive as possible in delivering their latest and greatest, to
<BR>
the point of delivering stuf that often doesn't quite work yet,
<BR>
DEC would actually intentionally slow down their processors, or hold
<BR>
back delivery of faster processors, just so they don't compete with
<BR>
their own existing systems.  It was definitely the wrong business
<BR>
model throttling some excellent technical development.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So, the reference was directed at DEC, circa 1997, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;NOT you.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ditto, circa 1982.
