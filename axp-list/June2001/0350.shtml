<P>Ok basically there is *nothing* wrong with the original ISO's at a *code
<BR>
execution level* (apart from the normal code bugs we'll always trip over),  the
<BR>
ISO's were pulled because it was discovered, after the CD's were gold, that the
<BR>
dependancy lists in the RPMs were inconsitant such that the Red Hat Network
<BR>
would not correctly identify which packages it needed to update or would impact
<BR>
if you tried to update your system using RHN (So for the vast majority of users,
<BR>
I can see you all shrugging shoulders and saying 'so what? I don't use that')
<BR>
RHN is a pivitol piece of technology that Red Hat wishes to use as part of it's
<BR>
movement into the services sector, so from the RHAT point of view, it has to be
<BR>
fixed, hence, the ISO's were pulled, and the affected RPMS were recompiled with
<BR>
a bumped release number such that the dependancies for each RPM were
<BR>
regenerated, so that the RHN would function correctly with the Alpha release.
<BR>
For those of you that have the original Gold CD's, if you've already installed
<BR>
the original ISO set and had hoped to use the RHN, your best way forward is to
<BR>
repull the ISO set and use the upgrade feature from the new ISO's which, because
<BR>
they have the bumped release numbers, should update your system to a state
<BR>
consistant with the RHN's rosey view of the universe.
<BR>
<P>As for the question, &quot;Ok, so where are the new ISO's?&quot; they should be available
<BR>
either today or tomorrow (last I heard)
