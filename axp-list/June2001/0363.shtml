<P>
I'm curious, hows the Canadian Anti-Trust case going against MS? I cant imagine
<BR>
that MS is just hose'in us USA folks alone - are they?
<BR>
<P>As for myself, i'm not sure of the diff between merging, and simply stopping
<BR>
production after so may years. Simply stopping offers no migration path. Merging
<BR>
does provide some transition path - although one might not know that within in
<BR>
that transition the &quot;bridge is out&quot; sign might get posted to all migratory
<BR>
travelers, with no one available to repair the path.
<BR>
<P>just my 2 cents

<EM>&gt; If you own something, and can't sell it, then is probably has less value.

<EM>&gt; The U.S. government seems unable to police Microsoft on what are really

<EM>&gt; fairly clear and straightforward abuses, so why should this be different?
