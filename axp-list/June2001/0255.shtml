HI
<BR>
<P>As sebastion mentioned the jensens also have the EV4 bug and it seems
<BR>
similar as you describe.
<BR>
All the 2.2.x kernels we had to patch the traps.c file with the following
<BR>
difference
<BR>
diff traps.c.org traps.c.new
<BR>
339c339,343
<BR>
&lt;                       /* 21264 (except pass 1) has precise exceptions.  */
<BR>

&gt;                       #ifdef CONFIG_ALPHA_EV4
&gt;                                if (alpha_fp_emul(regs.pc))
&gt;                                          return;
&gt;                         #else

&lt;                       if (alpha_fp_emul(regs.pc - 4))
&lt;                               return;

&gt;                         if (alpha_fp_emul(regs.pc))
&gt;                         {
&gt;                                 /* Increment the PC so that the program in
&gt;                                    user space continues */
&gt;                                 regs.pc += 4;
&gt;                                  return;
&gt;                         }
<P>I do not know witch kernel in 7.1 is used but til RH 7.0 with 2.2.19 this
was the case.
I do not have any hope that this will be include in the new kernels but if
someone can manage that it would be fine for all jensens, multia and other
old alpha's.
Is the new relaese still based on 2.2.x kernels or is this problem also
under 2.4.x kernels ?

&gt; 
&gt; Michal,
&gt; &gt; My interest here is purely theoretical, as I do not have Multia,
&gt; &gt; but does this test below uniquely identifies a machine with a broken
&gt; &gt; PAL?
&gt; &gt; .....
&gt; I didn't write the test, but I believe that it does.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Right.  But then this kernel with a fix would break existing
&gt; &gt; Multias booting from milo.  No?
&gt; 
&gt; The hard-coded fix WOULD break Multias booting from milo, correct.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Any chance that this may happen?  I would not bet on it.  And once
&gt; &gt; we would have around multias with broken PAL and other which would
&gt; &gt; be already fixed then the fun would be even bigger. :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; No.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Does this generalized patch take care about all problems mentioned?  It
&gt; &gt; seems to be testing in a bootup sequence if PC is advanced or not and
&gt; &gt; modifying traps behaviour depending on that.  How wide this was tested?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; We tried it on our multia here, and it worked.  We did NOT try it on
&gt; other non-multia machines.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; But instead of setting a flag and checking it every time when a fixup
&gt; &gt; may be needed one could set once a &quot;fixup offset&quot; to 0 or 4, depending
&gt; &gt; on a check, and add it unconditionally to 'regs.pc' in a proper place.
&gt; 
&gt; That sounds good.  I don't currently have a multia either, so I can't
&gt; test it.  (The person who wrote the original patch has moved on to other
&gt; employment and took the multia with him.)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Probably will be simpler and faster and PAL is not likely to change
&gt; &gt; under our feet - or I am mistaken?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, it should not change.
&gt; 
&gt; This whole thing strikes me as similar to the &quot;fixup&quot; code used to
&gt; work around various bugs in the X86 processors.   It should probably be
&gt; done in that area of code.

&gt; &gt; &gt; +                       regs.pc += 4;
&gt; &gt; &gt; +#endif /* alpha SRM */
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; No other boxes with the same return value from 'implver()'?
&gt; &gt; Sigh!  What a mess.  I remember seeing the above at the beggining
&gt; &gt; of this year and I had the same misgivings.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; .....
&gt; &gt; &gt; Before he left, Bill Carr product the following patch.. It is more
&gt; general
&gt; &gt; &gt; than the one above:
