<P>-&gt; My guess is the RealTek Ethernetcard 10/100 mbit.
<BR>
-&gt; Could that be ? It's a normal PCI card, but on the RedHat site Hardware

-&gt; Compatibility the RealTek card is not listed for Alpha version. Could that
<BR>
-&gt; be the problem ?
<BR>
<P>Hi,
<BR>
Did you see Kurt's mail??
<BR>
<P>He told about the kernel thing! That some alphas require a kernel
<BR>
compiled for that specific processor. I have experience with alpha
<BR>
au600 and xp1000. 
<BR>
<P>I don't want to be rude or unpolite with the guy who first replied,
<BR>
(the guy just said that there's a command to fix that &quot;make xconfig&quot;;
<BR>
this is to open the main menu to compile a kernel).
<BR>
Kurt is someone that you can really trust (he helped me a few times).
<BR>
<P>So if you have some similar machine try to compile the kernel on that
<BR>
machine. Or even simpler try to boot with a floppy disk, than see how
<BR>
the machine behaves. If it works use the kernel on the floppy disk...
<BR>
but try to compile a more specific kernel.
<BR>
<P>About the pci card there's no problem at all it simple don't work, but
<BR>
nothing that should halt the machine, this i know one for sure because
<BR>
i had one of those cards in an au600!
<BR>
<P>There's a kernel HOWTO that you should read before compiling it for the
<BR>
first time. The worst thing that may happen is that if you do something
<BR>
wrong you want be able to boot the machine :-) but this problem you already
<BR>
have!
<BR>
