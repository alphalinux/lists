<EM>&gt; &gt; I was thinking about the new PCI model of the G450(even though it´s a slap

<EM>&gt; Well, Michal knows best about those things.

<P>I know only what I have seen on a small sample of cards with
<BR>
which I tried to bring a server up. :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I know there's been problems with making both heads work, in the past,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; under XFree86. 2D, single head is fine, IIRC.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There's a small binary library (x86 only, of course) from Matrox that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is needed to make dual-head (among other things) work best.
</EM><BR>
<P>This HALlib module from Matrox is needed to get a picture on the
<BR>
second screen of a G400 card.  Without it everything seems to be just
<BR>
fine if you look at log files but there is this small detail that
<BR>
you cannot see anything on the second screen (the first one is fine).
<BR>
Matrox provides this binary-only module only for x86 - at least
<BR>
so far.  They make noises about other architectures but this remains
<BR>
to be seen.
<BR>
<P>OTOH with G450 a dual screen works without an extra HALlib and this
<BR>
means that it works on Alpha as well.  You have to explicitly specify
<BR>
PCI BusID for the second screen; the first one will be found by
<BR>
your server on a startup if not given in your XF86Config-4 file, but
<BR>
this is the only onerous requirement as far as I can tell.
<BR>
<P>With the card I was experimenting I had various &quot;nasties&quot; in a picture
<BR>
on the second screen in any resolution above 1024x768, IIRC.  No
<BR>
problems on the first screen or when resolution was low enough.  No idea
<BR>
what was the trouble here.  Could be that my hardware has
<BR>
&quot;imperfections&quot; or something is funny in software but the later would be
<BR>
a bit strange, I think.
