<P>
Compaq dropped NT support for Alpha circa RC2 for Win2k.  MS refused to &quot;go it
<BR>
alone&quot; on Alpha/NT without Compaq's (financial) support.  MS never released Win2k
<BR>
on Alpha.  However, MS used Alphas to build Win2k/64 in-house to prove that the
<BR>
code remained &quot;portable&quot; and did not contain any processor-specific type bugs.  It
<BR>
also helped during the period when IA64 was in short supply and buggier than a
<BR>
discovery-channel &quot;All bugs, all weekend&quot; special.  As of about 6 months ago MS
<BR>
had 1500+ IA64 systems, so hardware availability it's not such a big issue.
<BR>
<P>I think it would be interesting to see the on-die waste-of-space x86 emulation
<BR>
being replaced by various incarnations of FX!32.  Forget the Alpha chip -- the
<BR>
real jewels Intel has acquired is the killer back-end GEM compiler, and the FX!32
<BR>
translator.

<P><P><P>Speedracer,
<BR>
<P>Microsoft dropped Alpha support on Win 2k &quot;Whistler&quot; (XP). There will be no
<BR>
production version.
<BR>
IA-64 architecture is based on Alpha architecture (i.e. SAL/PAL, etc.),
<BR>
except that processor speeds can exceed 1GHz. Additionally, newer industry
<BR>
standards are being incorporated (i.e. Intel's EFI, ACPI) into 64-bit
<BR>
processing.
<BR>
<P>I am booting 16 processor IA-64 Itanium w/ Beta 2 (Build 2462) &quot;Whistler&quot;
<BR>
Datacenter.

<P><P><P>Interesting tidbit, there is a win2k version for Alpha floating around.
<BR>
In fact, from what I'd been told MS is useing the &quot;Alpha experience&quot;
<BR>
(their words not mine) to get NT technology working on the upcoming IA64.
<BR>
<P>My bootleg copy of WIN2k never showed up, but these people working for MS
<BR>
still claim that they have WIN2k and have even seen XP?!!? Running on
<BR>
Compaq Alpha machines.  Don't know how much of this to believe, but hey,
<BR>
thought I'd throw it out into the rumor mill.  Maybe someone with more
<BR>
reliable MS contacts can quiz a few people.
