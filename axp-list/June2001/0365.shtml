<EM>&gt; With regards to your message at 01:48 PM 6/27/01, Uncle George. Where you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stated:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I'm curious, hows the Canadian Anti-Trust case going against MS? I cant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;imagine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that MS is just hose'in us USA folks alone - are they?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Canadian case? Never heard of it..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The province of British Columbia offered MS a deal if they got convicted,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they could move across the border.. &lt;grin&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I think there was somthing going on out of ottawa but I am not sure.
<BR>
Since canadian courts don't seem to be into punitive damages I have a
<BR>
feeling that the imputus to start a lawsuit is a lot less here.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;As for myself, i'm not sure of the diff between merging, and simply stopping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;production after so may years. Simply stopping offers no migration path.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Merging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;does provide some transition path - although one might not know that within in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that transition the &quot;bridge is out&quot; sign might get posted to all migratory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;travelers, with no one available to repair the path.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think it is typical stupid shareholder reporting mentality.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There is one big thing that is a pain about publicly traded companies: They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to make shareholders happy, even when it is necessary to do so by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doing the wrong thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;just my 2 cents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And that's about $0.032 Canadian!
</EM><BR>
<P>Does anybody remember the intel product iapx423(I think the prefix may
<BR>
be wrong). After spending large numbers of Millions of dollars they took
<BR>
what they learned and made it the 286.
<BR>
<P>Anyway has anybody at API made any difinitave statements? I did a quick
<BR>
search of there website to no avail.
