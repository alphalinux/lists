<P><EM>&gt; &gt; until the 2.4 series.  Sure you can't make that upgrade?  I'm doubting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it, but thought I'd ask anyway. :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In a perfect world of course.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I didn't expect you could.  One nice thing about my systems not being used for
<BR>
production boxen. :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am rebuild the kernel as you suggested and will try that out.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The problem with this is that it takes about 24 hours before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we start to see a failure on one of the nodes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I understand that feeling.  We have tests that take _days_ sometimes. ;)  If
<BR>
you're just rebuilding with the same kernel config, you shouldn't need to
<BR>
reboot - the symbols should pretty much match up with what you have in your
<BR>
running kernel.  It's worth a try, anyway...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am looking that the source code for read_write.c between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.4.4 and 2.2.19.  It seems that in the llseek routines there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are not that many changes.  The main difference between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the size of a couple of the types (int to long) that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lock_kernel() and unlock kernel calls have been moved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from sys_lseek() to llseek().
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>&lt;snip code detective work&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In sys_lseek in 2.2.19, the lock_kernel() is at the beginning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the function and unlock_kernel() is right at the end.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; llseek function is called only from sys_lseek.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The code beyond that is no different as far as I can tell.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lock is just a bit more localized.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Right.  The difference is not in the llseek() code, but rather in the other
<BR>
users of the global kernel lock.  Usually it's not used because it's a good
<BR>
design decision, but because it's easier to get working that way.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Or were you saying that the global lock has the problem and not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how the global lock is called in lseek?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Both.:)  I don't see any _real_ reason to have the global lock held in a
<BR>
filesystem-specific call such as lseek().  Last thing I checked, it doesn't
<BR>
have much to do with networking, or VM, or scheduling, or...  The important
<BR>
question is not only who is waiting for the lock, but who is holding it.
<BR>
<P>If you really want to dig into this, get the lockmeter patches from
<BR>
oss.sgi.com/projects/lockmeter.  I ported them over to Alpha about a year ago
<BR>
- I'm not positive about the 2.2 patches, but when I did the port I made sure
<BR>
both 2.2 and 2.4 (then 2.3) worked.  Patch in, rebuild, reboot and run your
<BR>
load.  Somewhere in the middle (I'm assuming the load is somewhat
<BR>
steady-state) run lockmeter for say 5 minutes.  The report you get should tell
<BR>
you who is the big culprit for the lock problem you're seeing.  I'm hoping
<BR>
that it's in the global kernel lock and that it's in code that you can make
<BR>
some fairly easy changes to. :)  Of course, this is quite a bit of work, so I
<BR>
wouldn't blame you for not putting yourself through it.  Let me/us know what
<BR>
you come up with in whatever you're able to check out.
<BR>
