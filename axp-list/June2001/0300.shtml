<P>Reading between lines this also smells to me like an admission from
<BR>
Intel that they have big troubles with Itanic.  Especially that time
<BR>
scales mentioned in all these annoucements sound like ethernity in
<BR>
this business.  More so if you remember Intel pronoucements from,
<BR>
when it was - four or five years ago, that Merced (it was called that
<BR>
way at that time, right?) is &quot;right behind the corner&quot;.  If everything
<BR>
will go as planned (a very big IF) I would would be not very
<BR>
surprised to find out that future ia-64 variants look awfully close
<BR>
to a rebadged Alpha. :-)  But in these years ahead they are talking
<BR>
about we can still see quite a few other sharp turns.  Enjoy the ride!
<BR>
<P>Compaq is quite interesting with &quot;we are not making anymore but
<BR>
we are still making for a while&quot; on the referenced page.  Still the
<BR>
biggest kick one can get from &quot;read what our customers are saying&quot;
<BR>
in that place. :-)
