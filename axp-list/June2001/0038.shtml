<EM>&gt; Yes, there was a partnership between Digital and Kryotech right around the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time of the Compaq merger. It was a 767Mhz EV56 chilled with the Kryotech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;refrigerator&quot; slapped onto one side of the normal Miata GL case. I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they sold for about $24K at the time.

<EM>&gt; I had heard at one time they were playing with chilled EV6's but that was a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; while ago and nothing ever came of it. I also heard that Kryotech was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chilling Athlon based machines. That was also a while ago and I've never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seen one.

<P>There are a couple of cooling methods which cool to temperatures below
<BR>
ambient that a person could do in his own home.  The simplest being a
<BR>
peltier cooler--a pad of two different conducting materials sandwiched
<BR>
together, which when a current is run through them, one side gets hot and
<BR>
the other cold.  There's a good description of this at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.arstechnica.com/guide/cooling/peltier-1.html.">http://www.arstechnica.com/guide/cooling/peltier-1.html.</A>
<BR>
<P>The other way is via a small cooling tower.  I've seen descriptions of
<BR>
setups using 4 or 6 inch diameter PVC pipe with a small shower head at the
<BR>
top, or a coil of soft copper tubing drilled with small holes every few
<BR>
inches.  The idea is to sprinkle water down the tube while forcing air up
<BR>
it (with a 80mm or 92mm fan).  The water evaporates and dissipates the
<BR>
heat.  There are a few examples of this at <A HREF="http://www.overclockers.com.">http://www.overclockers.com.</A>
<BR>
<P>The cooling tower seems a little rickety to me, although technically
<BR>
fascinating.  A peltier along with a standard closed watercooling system
<BR>
seems far more practical.  Any of these can be done for far less than
<BR>
US$24K--more like $50 to $200.
