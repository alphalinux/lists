<P>
The guys at Tru64 engineering already have Tru64 ported to the
<BR>
Itanium. From what I'm told there are around 14 calls still outstanding,
<BR>
but the bulk of the work is done.
<BR>
<P>As far as VMS, I understand that the VMS engineering group are very
<BR>
confident that this is not going to be too hard a job. I understand that
<BR>
they have already been able to boot an Itanium system running VMS.
<BR>
<P>My two cents worth

<P><EM>&gt; I think the main thing to consider in all of this is that Compaq has a need 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to continue to support TRU64 and VMS on their hardware. It will certainly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take some time to port the OS to Itanium, and it will also take time for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Itanium to achieve anything resembling Alpha performance, both for existing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and future generations.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here is the quote from the Compaq press release that is both relevant, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gives a bit of an idea about what lies ahead:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Compaq will immediately begin to port Tru64 UNIX, OpenVMS and NonStop 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Kernel operating systems and development tools to the Itanium processor 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; family. Operating system and application development tools compatibility 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protects customers' long-term investments in Tru64 UNIX, OpenVMS, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; NonStop Kernel, as well as advancing the capabilities for Windows 2000 and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux on ProLiant.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In other words at least a year, probably 2 or 3 to move the OS over.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Technology Transfer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Under the multi-year technology agreement, Compaq is transferring 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; significant Alpha tools and engineering resources to Intel, as well as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; granting licenses to Compaq's Alpha microprocessor technology and compilers. &quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Intel now has access to the technologies and people who can make Itanium 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; faster.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;AlphaServer, NonStop, ProLiant Roadmaps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Compaq said it will continue to design and build new AlphaServer™ systems 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; based on current and upcoming Alpha processor technology through 2003.  The 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; company plans to upgrade the current high-end AlphaServer GS Series with a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1 GHz Alpha processor this summer. The next-generation EV7 Alpha processor, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which is currently under development, will power a new AlphaServer system 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; planned for introduction late next year. &quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In other words it will take at least 2 more years to phase out Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, this is the end of Alpha, but not for at least a couple of years.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Really I think this will be very good for Alpha products to migrate in to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the &quot;low cost market&quot; that people have been asking for.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; With the existing cost investment in Alpha, I think Compaq will want to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; squeeze every penny it can on what it has already paid for..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And for us Linux users the good news is that we will finally reach a point 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where we don't have the endless situation where the updates to kernel and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; libs lag between x86 and Alpha..
