<EM>&gt; Is it true that any kind of kernel debugger is not included in linux because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; linus doesn't like kdb?
</EM><BR>
<P>That's pretty much true.  Linus doesn't like kernel debuggers in general
<BR>
and the rest of the &quot;kernel elite&quot; feel that we should all be able to
<BR>
write bug-free code the first time (which, apparently, not even one of
<BR>
them can do...at least *I* haven't seen them do so).  The subtext of that
<BR>
stance is that they don't want &quot;just anyone&quot; writing kernel
<BR>
drivers/patches....you have to be accepted into their cabal to be able to
<BR>
do that...
<BR>
<P>Part of the practical reasons for not including one, though, is the
<BR>
possible size that it would add to the kernel source.  Granted, it
<BR>
wouldn't be that much compared to the benefits, but it's somewhat
<BR>
understandable.  The kernel source is getting quite large now.  I have had
<BR>
some ideas about how to deal with this from the point of distributing the
<BR>
kernel source, but have been hesitant to bring it up to anyone since
<BR>
nobody that matters wants to listen to anyone but themselves.
