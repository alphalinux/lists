Hello,
<BR>
<P>Our little cluster (5 DS-10's) is just chugging along, even though I haven't
<BR>
really had enough time to do much more than load it up with jobs.  Still,
<BR>
nodes have a tendency to just sort of &quot;drift off&quot;, they become completely
<BR>
non-responsive, well almost, I can ping them but nothing more than that.
<BR>
<P>There seem to be a series of events that leads to a hang-up.  If the nodes
<BR>
sit idle for awhile (by awhile I mean overnight) they seem to work perfectly
<BR>
fine if my first contact with them is via an &quot;rlogin&quot; command.  If my first
<BR>
contact is an rsh or rcp, then things stop working and the node becomes
<BR>
unreachable.  So, there is apparently something strange going on when these
<BR>
commands are the first issued.  I should note that rsh and rcp work just
<BR>
fine after the node has been &quot;awakened&quot; with an rlogin.
<BR>
<P>Anyone have any ideas?
<BR>
<P>Dwight
