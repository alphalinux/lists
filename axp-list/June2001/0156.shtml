<P>
I am running linux-2.2.19 on a base of Redhat 6.1 on
<BR>
several dual processor UP2000 nodes.  Packages
<BR>
that are requred to be upgraded according to the kernel
<BR>
have been.  The kernel has been patched to include
<BR>
a few NFS patches for this kernel.  
<BR>
<P>I am having problems with the nodes hanging up.  
<BR>
I am getting messages like the following:
<BR>
<P>sched.c:28 spinlock stuck in identd at fffffc000032de14(0) owner ps at
<BR>
fffffc0000350cd8(1) read_write.c:41
<BR>
<P>The messages are not all the same.  Once I saw when
<BR>
csh was fighting with csh.  I did not record all 
<BR>
the messages though.
<BR>
<P>When these messages start to show up on the console, 
<BR>
the node never gets unstuck.  You cannot rsh into
<BR>
the node. Rebooting is the only way to clear it up.
<BR>
<P>Since these nodes are in a cluster, there are many
<BR>
rsh and ssh processes to the boxes for mpi jobs.
<BR>
<P>My real question is not what is wrong, but how can
<BR>
I debug lock problems like this?  The line numbers never
<BR>
seem to correspond to any lines in the source code
<BR>
that are relevant (sometimes #include lines, other times
<BR>
just white space, but not to spinlocks or other SMP
<BR>
mechanisms).
<BR>
<P>Thanks, 
<BR>
Craig
