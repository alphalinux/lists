<P>
With regards to your message at 09:15 AM 6/27/01, Peter Watkinson. Where 
<BR>
you stated:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Well Transmeta developed the Crusoe how much did that cost?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;They must have got funding from somewhere.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, they did, as did many people in the last few years.
<BR>
To say that the economic and venture cap market has changed would be an 
<BR>
understatement.
<BR>
Then, of course, one has to ask who is going to fund it if it is &quot;open source&quot;?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;For me it's a real shame Intel buying the Alpha I'm amazed that the US
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Government doesn't intervene.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm sure I read on the Alpha Powered website that Alpha development was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;protected by Law for the next 20 years. It's like Coke buying Pepsi or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Mcdonalds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;buying Burger King I 'm sure they'd take some action then.
</EM><BR>
<P>Really? Why?
<BR>
If you own something, and can't sell it, then is probably has less value.
<BR>
The U.S. government seems unable to police Microsoft on what are really 
<BR>
fairly clear and straightforward abuses, so why should this be different?
<BR>
Whether you like Intel or not, they are successful, and no government wants 
<BR>
to curb a local industry that is employing lots of people and making money.
<BR>
If you want real grounds for monopoly abuse against Intel contemplate the 
<BR>
fact that it is in a battle with AMD, and by all reports selling it's P4 
<BR>
CPUs below cost. Usually that abuse is called dumping, among other things.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;For my part I'd like to see another Risc processor. Not sure how high end it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would need to be.
</EM><BR>
We already have enough of those.
<BR>
What we don't have is an economy where Compaq feels they can win a long 
<BR>
term battle with Intel and Sun, and make enough off of it to satisfy 
<BR>
shareholders.
<BR>
