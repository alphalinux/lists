<P>IIRC, the 928 cards were the ONLY cards ever supported on JENSEN, and
<BR>
that was done with a bunch of patches (part of the sources, but only
<BR>
active on Alpha and JENSEN).
<BR>
<P>Yes, there was code for the old COMPAQ QVision EISA adapters in the
<BR>
XFree86 sources, but they were orphaned at some point, subsequently
<BR>
dropped from the source tree for 4.0 (IIRC). Regardless, they weren't
<BR>
ever ported to Alpha (as the 928 support was), AFAIK. Too bad, too;
<BR>
they were capable of multi-head operation - I once had a 6-head setup
<BR>
under Digital OSF1, had to take out the Ethernet controller to get to
<BR>
6 heads, as there were only 7 slots and one was needed for SCSI... ;-}
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	The was some traffic on the debian alpha list about enabling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; jensen support or something in their 4.0.? port.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think the comment was, that you have to explicitly go into the sources
<BR>
for 4.x.x to turn on JENSEN support, and there's no guarantee that it'll
<BR>
work even then. AFAICT, there's been no testing of that code since the
<BR>
3.3 releases, and the code has just been carried forward with no attempt
<BR>
(so far) to see if it will still work.
