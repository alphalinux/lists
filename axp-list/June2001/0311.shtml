<P>
<EM>&gt; I still can't get my head around what the hell Compaq gets out of this.  It 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can not be humanly possible to port their tools, OpenVMS, AND True64 to an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ia-64 type system that doesn't even exist yet in only 3 years.  And how much 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will that cost?  The entire distribution of RedHat 7.1 is estimated to be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; over 1 Billion dollars.  Porting two operating systems and all of the tools 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can not be any cheaper than that.
</EM><BR>
<P>Tru64 already has a head start, as there was a project to port Tru64
<BR>
to the IA64 earlier; they can pick up where they left off.
<BR>
<P>Himalaya NSK was being ported to the IA64 when Pfieffer (sp?) killed
<BR>
the port in favor of a port to Alpha.  Again, they can pick up where
<BR>
they left off.
<BR>
<P>The port for OpenVMS is expected to take the longest time, at 18 months,
<BR>
but a lot of the porting work should be easier as they went through
<BR>
most of the problems during the VAX-&gt;Alpha port.  The biggest roadblock
<BR>
should be getting the GEM compilers ready.
<BR>
<P>Most of this information is from the announcement and discussions in
<BR>
comp.os.vms.
