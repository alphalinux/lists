Another set of questions;
<BR>
<P>1 - Since the deal is 'non-exclusive', why not also provide similar deal to 
<BR>
AMD so they also get full access to EV-7/EV-8 etc stuff and integrate them 
<BR>
with X86-64? I'm sure AMD could make a pure 64-bit CPU that could run both 
<BR>
Alpha and X86-64 binaries...
<BR>
<P>2 - Are we going to see another press release in say June 2003, saying &quot;Due 
<BR>
to increased cost and diminishing returns as it now has no distinctive 
<BR>
hardware compared to the others, Compaq will transfer its Tru64 and OVMS OS 
<BR>
platforms, engineers etc. to Micro$oft, and will only use Windows XPGT 
<BR>
Enterprise in its future Itanium servers, of course enhanced with Tru64 &amp; 
<BR>
OVMS features given to M$'
<BR>
<P>3 - An Intel exec told me today that Intel will not necessarily stay with 
<BR>
the present Itanium instr set and that, if the performance demands it, they 
<BR>
may combine Alpha and Itanium arch and instr set features into the 'Itanium 
<BR>
Procesor Family 2 - IPF2' starting in 2004, after Madison CPU. He says that 
<BR>
even providing hardware assists for direct Alpha binary execution is 
<BR>
considered. I also heard their very negative opinion about Compaq PR and 
<BR>
customer handling, saying Intel is aware about many customers' being pissed 
<BR>
off...

<EM>&gt;Aaron,

<EM>&gt;All I can think of is two questions: 1)  Are they really going to port VMS 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and Tru64 to IA-64?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and if they say Yes, 2) Really, for sure?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Oh, I just thought of another one... (this one is probably the kind you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are looking for)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Is Compaq going to continue to service Alpha systems?  We have some 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;excellent tech's doing on-site hardware maintenance and it looks like 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we'll need them more than ever, now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt;Thanks,

<EM>&gt;&gt;Hi all,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Anyone care anymore?  Well, if you do, I'll be on a concall with the Q
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;regarding the &quot;news&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;I'm trying to think of good questions to ask, and thought I'd seek input
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;from you folks.  Anyone got any good ideas?  (serious, now, if you please)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;I obviously won't be able to ask all, but I'll ask what I can.
</EM><BR>
