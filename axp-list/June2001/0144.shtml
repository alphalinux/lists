<P>Well, I've seen one G400 without 2nd head; works fine in 2D, can't get

<EM>&gt; what was the trouble here.  Could be that my hardware has

<EM>&gt; &quot;imperfections&quot; or something is funny in software but the later would be

<EM>&gt; a bit strange, I think.

<P>Does the server try to run int10 on the BIOS for the second head?
<BR>
What I mean is, does the BIOS emulation run on both the primary and
<BR>
secondary heads, or does it look like it's trying them one at a time?
<BR>
<P>Reason I ask: I've played around a bit with putting two cards into
<BR>
some of the Alphas (with DS10 and XP1000, one can put 2 3DLabs VX1s
<BR>
in, and the console won't barf. Note that this is only with VX1 cards,
<BR>
they are looked for specifically). What usually happens under XFree86
<BR>
is that the int10 BIOS emulator runs on the first card but not the
<BR>
second, and because the second doesn't get &quot;officially&quot; initialized,
<BR>
video is significantly screwed up.
