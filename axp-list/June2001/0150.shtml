<EM>&gt;  This HALlib module from Matrox is needed to get a picture on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; second screen of a G400 card.  Without it everything seems to be just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fine if you look at log files but there is this small detail that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cannot see anything on the second screen (the first one is fine).
</EM><BR>
<P>There's no code in XFree86 to deal with the second head of the G400. If it 
<BR>
claims to be trying to do so, that's a bug.
<BR>
<P>The second head of the G400 is reasonably well-documented, and example code
<BR>
exists in the Linux matroxfb driver - the author of which has given
<BR>
permission for his code to be reused under the XFree86 licence. All that's 
<BR>
missing is a volunteer with sufficient motivation and time to port it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  With the card I was experimenting I had various &quot;nasties&quot; in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; picture on the second screen in any resolution above 1024x768, IIRC.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No problems on the first screen or when resolution was low enough.  No
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idea what was the trouble here.  Could be that my hardware has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;imperfections&quot; or something is funny in software but the later would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be a bit strange, I think.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've heard reports of strangeness with some modelines. It's working fine 
<BR>
here, albeit on i386, with 1600x1200 on the second head. It doesn't use 
<BR>
int10.
