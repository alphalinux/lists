<P>
might also be the memory that is in it. did you try swapping it yet?
<BR>
<P>also it may be the cache on the motherboard. if it's that, then you're kinda
<BR>
stuck living with the ECC errors.

<P>Will try it.

<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Somehow, I got Red Hat 7.0 installed, and stupid as I am on DOS

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, via floppy or network. Or boot, do a

<EM>&gt; dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null bs=512 count=4
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (this zeros out the partition table) and re-install, the RH installer will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then see no disk label and partition using BSD.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I made some progress alst night. With a two-floppy combination of
<BR>
flashing AlphaBIOS and from there booting MILO, I managed to boot RH up.
<BR>
I think I found why the board was discarded in the first place, as it
<BR>
screams a lot about &quot;correctable ECC errors&quot;. It's appearance seems to
<BR>
be connected with hard disk activity, so I'd say the onboard IDE is
<BR>
dead. Well, I have a Promise Ultra66 controller lying about, will try to
<BR>
use it today.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;From MILO, I also tried to do a `resetenv' and it replied:
