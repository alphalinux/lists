<EM>&gt; There's no code in XFree86 to deal with the second head of the G400. If it

</EM><BR>
<P>To be more precise I was experimenting with various &quot;rawhide&quot; rpms
<BR>
for XFree86-4.0.3 (Mike Harris from Red Hat); in particular 4.0.3-15
<BR>
and 4.0.3-16.  These sources included somethings which seemed to me
<BR>
as a dual head support for mga but I may as well be mistaken.  It seems
<BR>
to be working, at least to some extent, for G450 and this HALlib
<BR>
requirement for G400 is mentioned by Matrox in READMEs which come
<BR>
with their driver; but they may mean the current state of affairs.
<BR>
<P>OTOH these srpms include things like 'XFree86-4.0.3-mga-dualhead-dpms.patch'
<BR>
so I am not sure what this is fixing?  Do you mean that G400 requires
<BR>
more model specific spells?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The second head of the G400 is reasonably well-documented, and example code
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exists in the Linux matroxfb driver - the author of which has given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; permission for his code to be reused under the XFree86 licence. All that's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; missing is a volunteer with sufficient motivation and time to port it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Some understanding what is going on would undoubtely help as well. :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've heard reports of strangeness with some modelines. It's working fine 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here, albeit on i386, with 1600x1200 on the second head.
</EM><BR>
<P>G450 or G400?  Could you mail me out-of-list your XF86Config file?
<BR>
Modelines I tried were mostly defaults (or maybe slightly tuned up
<BR>
for my monitor).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It doesn't use int10.
