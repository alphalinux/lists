<P>
I just want to understand some of this Compaq/Intel crap.
<BR>
<P>1) Compaq is selling all of their Alpha tech to Intel and then promising to 
<BR>
use Intel's future 64bit designs (whatever that may be) for Compaq hardware.
<BR>
<P>My problems with this are:
<BR>
Is the govt going to allow this?
<BR>
<P>What happens to purely Compaq products? (SRM, OpenVMS, True64, Compaq's 
<BR>
compilers, etc)
<BR>
<P>How freaking stupid is Compaq's management?  Intel can't even get a first 
<BR>
generation ia-64 product out the door.  Does anyone really think they will 
<BR>
have a next generation processor available by 2004.  Talk about being sold on 
<BR>
marketing.
<BR>
<P>2)  How much of future Alpha design is inside of API now?
<BR>
<P>API seems to have been forced to be an all Linux hardware company with this 
<BR>
announcement.  Which makes their work for gcc 3.0 improvements very 
<BR>
important.  Personally I'm only buying Linux stuff, so Compaq leaving isn't 
<BR>
that big of a deal.  UNLESS this really going to affect future design 
<BR>
improvements by API.
