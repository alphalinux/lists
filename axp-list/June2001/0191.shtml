<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Look, I'm just pointing out that it's a stable situation. If you ask
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; inflammatory questions, what good do you think it will come out of it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think anything will come of it, frankly.
</EM><BR>
<P>So then why post?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Apparently, the only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people who &quot;matter&quot; like the status quo, so why even entertain my rant?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I think it's clear that people don't see any _constructive_ action
<BR>
to be taken.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For the record, &quot;stable&quot; doesn't always equal &quot;best situation or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compromise&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course not.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What history shows that we're often &quot;in synch&quot;?  Take a look back at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; state of Alpha even as far back as 2.0.x.  What history shows is that it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; frequently takes more than two minor revisions of the kernel to get Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;in sync&quot; with the changes made to the rest of the code.
</EM><BR>
<P>I call that &quot;often in synch&quot;. A real fork is one in which you don't
<BR>
closely track the other fork. And when Jay was maintaining Alpha
<BR>
patches, he was closely tracking the main kernel, just like Alan
<BR>
closely tracks Linus now.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Apparently, though, you either misunderstand my overall point with what I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wrote.  I was always taught that the only dumb questions were the ones not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; asked, so I think that asking repeatedly is sometimes worthwhile since it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just might change a not-so-good situation.
</EM><BR>
<P>Or you could cause a lot of flammage, and no constructive action.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In short, this discussion may be a &quot;kernel politics&quot; hot-plate, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think that taking a &quot;let's not rock the boat or upset
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyone&quot; approach is working in the best interest of the development of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha portions of the kernel.
</EM><BR>
<P>Apparently you have mistaken my writings with a &quot;let's not rock the
<BR>
boat&quot; attitude. I'd suggest re-reading what I've written. What I _am_
<BR>
saying is that this isn't the place to discuss overall kernel
<BR>
politics, and that this port has had adequate success in the past
<BR>
keeping up with the main kernel.
