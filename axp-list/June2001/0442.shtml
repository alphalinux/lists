<P><EM>&gt; &gt; There is the rub. You will need AT LEAST that, more likely a 400W, and it

<EM>&gt; &gt; is &quot;sort of&quot; soft power.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; We recommend a hard power supply, as there were too many issues with the LX
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; controlling soft power supplies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd disgaree with that....I've run both my and SX and now an LX with a 300
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; w/o any trouble. This is with a fast SCSI disk, CD-ROM, CD-burner, 4mm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DAT etc....and for a long told an old full height seagate SCSI. If you're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; putting into a server with many, many disks then I'd agree with Maurice,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but for just a home workstation you should be OK.
</EM><BR>
<P>In my experience you just can't compare power supplies by their respective
<BR>
rated wattages.
<BR>
<P>For example, the PC Power &amp; Cooling Turbo-Cool 300 ATX puts out the same
<BR>
amps as a Leadman Powmax LP-6100D 400 watt power supply (listed on AMD's
<BR>
Athlon approved list) on the following lines:
<BR>
<P>+5v
<BR>
+3.3v
<BR>
-5v
<BR>
<P>The LP-6100D does better on +12v (16A vs 12A on the PC P&amp;C), but the PC
<BR>
P&amp;C 300w ps does better on -12v (1A vs 0.5A on the LP-6100D).
<BR>
<P>Possibly more important is the regulation characteristics of the power
<BR>
supplies.  The PC P&amp;C power supply has the best regulation characteristics
<BR>
I've ever seen, bar none.
<BR>
<P>For example, the following is the rated power regulation of an Enermax
<BR>
EG365P-VE FC 350 watt power supply:
<BR>
<P>DC v.	Tot. Reg.
<BR>
3.3v	+/- 4%
<BR>
+5v	    5%
<BR>
+12v	    5%
<BR>
-5v	   10%
<BR>
-12v	   10%
<BR>
+5Vsb	    5%
<BR>
<P>Compare to the PC P&amp;C Turbo Cool 300 watt:
<BR>
<P>DC v.	Tot. Reg.
<BR>
3.3v	+/- 1%
<BR>
+5v	    5%
<BR>
+12v	    5%
<BR>
-5v	    5%
<BR>
-12v	    5%
<BR>
+5Vsb	  (N/A)
<BR>
<P>This is not to say that the PC Power &amp; Cooling power supplies are the best
<BR>
available; rather, the PC P&amp;C as well as the Leadman and Enermax power
<BR>
supplies were the only units I had data available to me in my computer
<BR>
room at home at 11pm as I type this.  :-)
<BR>
<P>I should point out that when I built my home server using a PC164
<BR>
motherboard and the above mentioned Leadman Powmax LP-6100D 400w power
<BR>
supply, the motherboard died shortly thereafter with a fried voltage
<BR>
regulator.  While I have no irrefutable evidence that the power supply was
<BR>
the cause, I have made the decision to only use PC Power &amp; Cooling power
<BR>
supplies (or those with equivalent regulation/ripple characteristics) in
<BR>
future Alpha systems.
