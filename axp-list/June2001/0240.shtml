<EM>&gt; I fail to understand Linus's stubborn refusal to adopt a version system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like CVS.  That's how distributed development is done.
</EM><BR>
<P>But, you forget, the kernel is NOT a project that's a wide-scale
<BR>
development project.  Sure, many people submit patches and blah, blah,
<BR>
blah, but, for the most part, only two people control what goes into the
<BR>
kernel tree (Alan and Linus)...and that's the way they want to keep it.
<BR>
<P>I don't object to having a few folks reviewing changes, especially since
<BR>
the volume of changes submitted daily could easily pollute/break kernel
<BR>
operation possibly every minute of each day, but the case could be made
<BR>
also that the sheer volume is more than two people can handle.
<BR>
<P>I dunno the solution, personally.  My feeling is that they should allow
<BR>
the ports to maintain themselves by using a person/group in charge of each
<BR>
port who can have total control over the changes that go in for that port.
<BR>
I don't see how either Alan or Linus (neither of which, IIRC, has powered
<BR>
up their Alphas in over a year) know what's best for Alpha.
<BR>
<P>I know I'm coming off a bit harsh against Alan and Linus...I don't mean
<BR>
to, but frustration has set in within my brain.  I have had pleasant
<BR>
conversations with both and think that they both do a damn good job under
<BR>
the circumstances, but I can't help but feel like i386 and powerpc get
<BR>
more attention from them than any other port out there (making the rest of
<BR>
us feel like our architectures are &quot;second-class citizens&quot;).
