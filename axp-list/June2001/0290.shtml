<P>
Mark brings some good points, I have my own in this
<BR>
regards having met some of the developers internal to
<BR>
the Alphaserver group.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; 1) Compaq is selling all of their Alpha tech to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Intel and then promising to use Intel's future 64bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; designs (whatever that may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be) for Compaq hardware.
</EM><BR>
<P>Does Compaq have any clue how long it would take to
<BR>
get all the Alpha software ported to IA64
<BR>
(Itanium/McKinnley, etc)? The SRM/PALcode dependency
<BR>
alone is a show stopper. A new emulation/recompiler
<BR>
would have to be built to facilitate Alpha over IA64
<BR>
emulation, and that will further handicap the IA64
<BR>
platform.  Given that Alpha just got the crown for HPC
<BR>
and a large following of OpenVMS/Alpha users in the
<BR>
finacial and health segments, what on earth are they
<BR>
doing?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; My problems with this are:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is the govt going to allow this?
</EM><BR>
<P>GOOD POINT!! Digital and Intel went to court over
<BR>
patent infrigements (Intel grabbed some Alpha bits to
<BR>
improve Pentium illegally) and the DOJ stepped in to
<BR>
make SURE Intel didn't outright buy Alpha off the
<BR>
cash-hemorhagging Digital.  Does the Compaq Intel deal
<BR>
have any loopholes that would prevent the DOJ from
<BR>
doing the same thing again?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; What happens to purely Compaq products? (SRM,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OpenVMS, True64, Compaq's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compilers, etc)
</EM><BR>
<P>I would suppose they would be emulated, migrated and
<BR>
then dissipated as Compaq Alpha engineers become Intel
<BR>
engineers to leave to pursue other careers.  I thought
<BR>
the Compaq buyout was bad, this is far worse for
<BR>
sustaining Compaq/Digital platforms, notably all
<BR>
things Alpha (Tru64, OpenVMS, Non-Stop Clusters,
<BR>
Advanced Server, compilers, SRM, board designs,
<BR>
chipset designs, CPU designs, patents, etc). 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How freaking stupid is Compaq's management?  Intel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't even get a first generation ia-64 product out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the door.  Does anyone really think they will 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a next generation processor available by 2004. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Talk about being sold on marketing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Intel did one hell of a sales job on Compaq for Compaq
<BR>
to risk losing its most loyal following in some very
<BR>
high profit segments on the &quot;promise&quot; that IA64 will
<BR>
rule the world.  Trading a proven platform for an
<BR>
unproven platform after publicly denouncing the IA64
<BR>
design in favor of Alpha and then dumping the port
<BR>
effort of Tru64 UNIX to IA64 shortly after.  
<BR>
<P>This is a 180 degree reversal of both the dismissal of
<BR>
IA64 and the current lack of a &quot;Alpha peer&quot; in either
<BR>
performance or robustness.  Compilers for IA64 still
<BR>
have a lot of growing up to do, as do the platforms
<BR>
that run under them. Alpha was introduced slowly with
<BR>
VAX forming the underpinnings.  This move looks more
<BR>
like cannibalization.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2)  How much of future Alpha design is inside of API
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now?
</EM><BR>
<P>Samsung, through API, owns design patents on Alpha and
<BR>
indeed enjoy a high degree of autonomy. What I don't
<BR>
know is if the patents include the all important
<BR>
patents for SRM/PALcode and the obvious need to share
<BR>
some of this information with Compaq to consolidate
<BR>
certain platform plans.  API has it's own chipset in
<BR>
th works to replace the aging Tsunami which differed
<BR>
from Compaq's slated Titan II.  Presumably, API could
<BR>
survive by using it's &quot;Linux in ROM&quot; and using legacy
<BR>
PALcode, at least for a time. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; API seems to have been forced to be an all Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hardware company with this announcement.  Which 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; makes their work for gcc 3.0
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; improvements very 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; important.  Personally I'm only buying Linux stuff,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so Compaq leaving isn't 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that big of a deal.  UNLESS this really going to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; affect future design 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; improvements by API.
</EM><BR>
<P>They were officially Linux anyway. It just so happened
<BR>
some of their systems were Tru64 compliant, though
<BR>
Compaq was eliminating support for newer support
<BR>
hardware (storage, network and video controllers).
<BR>
<P>Comments anyone? I feel like going home to stare at my
<BR>
three Alpha's for a time, sobbing.
<BR>
