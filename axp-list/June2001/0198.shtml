<EM>&gt;&gt;Look, I'm just pointing out that it's a stable situation. If you ask

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I don't think anything will come of it, frankly.  Apparently, the only

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;For the record, &quot;stable&quot; doesn't always equal &quot;best situation or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;compromise&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Because that's a stupid idea? History has shown us that we are often
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;totally in synch.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
Uh, &quot;stupid idea&quot; coming from someone saying &quot;no religious wars&quot;? :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I've always disagreed with forking the kernel, personally, but NOT forking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the kernel requires more patience and knowing everyone's little quirks,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which gets downright irritating at times.  I feel like I'm in high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;school: gotta be in the right &quot;crowd&quot; to get anything done.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What history shows that we're often &quot;in synch&quot;?  Take a look back at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;state of Alpha even as far back as 2.0.x.  What history shows is that it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;frequently takes more than two minor revisions of the kernel to get Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;in sync&quot; with the changes made to the rest of the code.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Okay, brace for this armchair quarterback's brain dump:
<BR>
<P>Compared to many other arches, alpha is actually quite in-synch.  I used 
<BR>
to flame linuxppc-dev and debian-powerpc for the persistent policy of 
<BR>
keeping (multiple!) separate trees for PPC kernels, pointing to the 
<BR>
shining example of alpha as how a port should be run:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Present and discuss patches against stock on a list like this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one.  (I agree with Greg that this has been the de-facto gathering
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place of alpha folk from many arches.)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Send the resulting patches to Linus and/or Alan.
<BR>
<P>Because alpha has done this pretty well, 2.2.x stock came with excellent 
<BR>
alpha support, from 2.2.0 through 2.2.19, while PPC required patches 
<BR>
through 2.2.18, and ARM has never been in synch!  However, it took a 
<BR>
very substantial amount of work to make that happen.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, with massive filesystem additions that were known to only 
<BR>
work at all on i386 (and then with some bugs), interface changes that 
<BR>
were only tested on i386, and entire subsystem rewrites, all happening 
<BR>
between 2.4.x subversions, this has been impossible to keep up with 
<BR>
2.4.x.  Maybe we do need to fork after all, and leave out the 
<BR>
last-minute junk that doesn't work yet...
<BR>
<P>The way PPC works is that Cort, Paul, and Ben H (Ani Joshi too?) each 
<BR>
have their own rsync/Bitkeeper archives for stable and unstable, one is 
<BR>
usually better for stable and the other for unstable.  Daily snapshots 
<BR>
are built both of the whole tarball, and also a patch vs. Linus' latest 
<BR>
-test release, with a goal of keeping that patch as small as possible 
<BR>
while still making progress on the arch.  So new features are brought in 
<BR>
when they work, and the patches split up and submitted to Linus/Alan on 
<BR>
a somewhat regular basis, which has been a lot more frequent in the last 
<BR>
6-8 months than before that.
<BR>
<P>As noted, I used to hate that system, but with the 2.4 madness, must 
<BR>
admit to some pretty big advantages for at least one forked tree, over 
<BR>
swimming against the rapids to stay in synch.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Prior summaries of what I really think would help the situation are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;correct: I advocate annointing someone or a group of someones to act as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;port maintainers&quot;, which would review architectural changes and would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;follow the kernel development more closely than your average &quot;I only work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on my driver&quot; kernel hacker.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
This is already somewhat the case, see the MAINTAINERS file, which has 
<BR>
entries for ARM, PPC, PMAC (though Paul is taking over all of PPC from 
<BR>
Cort now), M68K, MIPS, S390, SPARC and the SGI VWS subarch.  But no 
<BR>
alpha (and I imagine we'd have quite a contest for such a post :-). 
<BR>
&nbsp;Again, all of the other arch maintainers are keepers of that arch's 
<BR>
fork, which we haven't needed for alpha since Jay's 2.0.x patches.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  They could be the ones that understand the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;implications of changes made to the arch-independent portions of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;kernel and review patches in that context (with the ultimate goal being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stability and consistency across architectures...or at least as much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;consistency as is possible).  The way it is now, only a small number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people review and commit ALL changes to the kernel.  As any management
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;training will preach, it's just not possible for a group of less than 10
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people to effectively manage the amount of people who submit patches to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the kernel.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Oh my, I'm not sure we should even have that many reviewing all of the 
<BR>
changes.  How about a 64-bit person (alpha, IA-64, SPARC64, S390, 
<BR>
MIPS64, soon PPC64), a big-endian person (SPARC, MIPS, HPPA, PPC, M68K), 
<BR>
and an unsigned-char person (ARM, PPC), with at least one NUMA guy with 
<BR>
broad arch experience?  I don't know about the other arches (SuperH, 
<BR>
etc.), but that would cut down your team of ~13 to three or four and 
<BR>
should make everything work everywhere.
<BR>
<P>Not that such a &quot;best situation or compromise&quot; is going to happen 
<BR>
though.:-)
<BR>
<P>But if what comes out of all this is an alpha maintainer who coordinates 
<BR>
this arch's patches and mailbombs them to Linus and Alan with some 
<BR>
chance of success, and perhaps maybe possibly a CVS, Bitkeeper or 
<BR>
Subversion archive of a &quot;working&quot; alpha tree to the extent this is 
<BR>
absolutely necessary (as they have made it necessary with 2.4's 
<BR>
wrenching changes), then that would represent progress. Do you agree 
<BR>
with that much, Greg?
<BR>
<P>Zeen,
