<P><EM>&gt; Look, I'm just pointing out that it's a stable situation. If you ask
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inflammatory questions, what good do you think it will come out of it?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think anything will come of it, frankly.  Apparently, the only
<BR>
people who &quot;matter&quot; like the status quo, so why even entertain my rant?
<BR>
For the record, &quot;stable&quot; doesn't always equal &quot;best situation or
<BR>
compromise&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Because that's a stupid idea? History has shown us that we are often
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; totally in synch.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've always disagreed with forking the kernel, personally, but NOT forking
<BR>
the kernel requires more patience and knowing everyone's little quirks,
<BR>
which gets downright irritating at times.  I feel like I'm in high
<BR>
school: gotta be in the right &quot;crowd&quot; to get anything done.
<BR>
<P>What history shows that we're often &quot;in synch&quot;?  Take a look back at the
<BR>
state of Alpha even as far back as 2.0.x.  What history shows is that it
<BR>
frequently takes more than two minor revisions of the kernel to get Alpha
<BR>
&quot;in sync&quot; with the changes made to the rest of the code.
<BR>
<P>Apparently, though, you either misunderstand my overall point with what I
<BR>
wrote.  I was always taught that the only dumb questions were the ones not
<BR>
asked, so I think that asking repeatedly is sometimes worthwhile since it
<BR>
just might change a not-so-good situation.  Obviously, if I didn't care
<BR>
what happened on Alpha, then I wouldn't bother writing as much as I
<BR>
have.  In short, this discussion may be a &quot;kernel politics&quot; hot-plate, but
<BR>
I don't think that taking a &quot;let's not rock the boat or upset
<BR>
anyone&quot; approach is working in the best interest of the development of the
<BR>
Alpha portions of the kernel.  Fact is, I get more questions about why
<BR>
some kernel version or another doesn't compile on Alpha and when I think
<BR>
the changes will be integrated than ANY other questions (including &quot;will
<BR>
Linux run on my machine?&quot;).  If even one third of the kernel versions
<BR>
within a RELEASED kernel major version (2.1.x and 2.3.x don't count since 
<BR>
they're development version cycles), it's just not acceptable to me
<BR>
(nor anyone else who's ever done any kind of QA testing...one third is a
<BR>
pretty substantial failure rate for a released product).
<BR>
<P>Prior summaries of what I really think would help the situation are
<BR>
correct: I advocate annointing someone or a group of someones to act as
<BR>
&quot;port maintainers&quot;, which would review architectural changes and would
<BR>
follow the kernel development more closely than your average &quot;I only work
<BR>
on my driver&quot; kernel hacker.  They could be the ones that understand the
<BR>
implications of changes made to the arch-independent portions of the
<BR>
kernel and review patches in that context (with the ultimate goal being
<BR>
stability and consistency across architectures...or at least as much
<BR>
consistency as is possible).  The way it is now, only a small number of
<BR>
people review and commit ALL changes to the kernel.  As any management
<BR>
training will preach, it's just not possible for a group of less than 10
<BR>
people to effectively manage the amount of people who submit patches to
<BR>
the kernel. (Yes, I was the unwilling participant in the Fed. Govt's
<BR>
Incident Command training :-P).
<BR>
<P>Of course, you're welcome to disagree with me as vehemently as you'd like
<BR>
:-)
