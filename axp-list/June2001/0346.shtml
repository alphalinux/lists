<EM>&gt; So, does that mean I shouldn't install it on my LX's and SX?  I finished
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; burning the ISOs to CD-R just an hour before they pulled it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I got it downloaded just in time as well.  Actually my download of disk1 was 
<BR>
messed up and I found that download.sourceforge.net was running an rsync 
<BR>
server with redhat as a module.  I was able to rsync my broken iso from 
<BR>
there.  So instead of several hours to redownload it only took about 15 
<BR>
minutes to repair the file.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I've installed it on an old as/200 box.  I haven't seen any real 
<BR>
problems so far.  Interesting features: kernel 2.4.3, XFree 4.0.3, kde 2.1.1 
<BR>
with 2.1.2 updates for kdelibs, and several other packages that the x86 
<BR>
version doesn't have (I think x86 updates are available though).
<BR>
<P>My problems so far:  arts just doesn't cut it on a 166MHz box, kpanelapplet 
<BR>
crashes (which I wasn't having with RH 6.2), and that seems to be it.  Note: 
<BR>
I don't use Gnome so I don't know how those packages work.
