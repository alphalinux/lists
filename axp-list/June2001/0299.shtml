<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I so agree with you on the going home and sharing a last somber
<BR>
good by drink and sob with my alpha.  Under linux my DDR Athlon is performing
<BR>
comparably.  How much life is left?  I guess 4 years and then Alpha gets to
<BR>
be the yesterdays hardware that also runs linux we see today of the old
<BR>
386 and 486's.  All the worlds an x86.  Long live innovation.

<EM>&gt; Mark brings some good points, I have my own in this

<EM>&gt; the Alphaserver group.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 1) Compaq is selling all of their Alpha tech to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Intel and then promising to use Intel's future 64bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; designs (whatever that may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be) for Compaq hardware.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Does Compaq have any clue how long it would take to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get all the Alpha software ported to IA64
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Itanium/McKinnley, etc)? The SRM/PALcode dependency
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alone is a show stopper. A new emulation/recompiler
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would have to be built to facilitate Alpha over IA64
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; emulation, and that will further handicap the IA64
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; platform.  Given that Alpha just got the crown for HPC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and a large following of OpenVMS/Alpha users in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; finacial and health segments, what on earth are they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doing?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; My problems with this are:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Is the govt going to allow this?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; GOOD POINT!! Digital and Intel went to court over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; patent infrigements (Intel grabbed some Alpha bits to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; improve Pentium illegally) and the DOJ stepped in to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make SURE Intel didn't outright buy Alpha off the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cash-hemorhagging Digital.  Does the Compaq Intel deal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have any loopholes that would prevent the DOJ from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doing the same thing again?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; What happens to purely Compaq products? (SRM,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; OpenVMS, True64, Compaq's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; compilers, etc)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would suppose they would be emulated, migrated and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then dissipated as Compaq Alpha engineers become Intel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineers to leave to pursue other careers.  I thought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Compaq buyout was bad, this is far worse for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sustaining Compaq/Digital platforms, notably all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things Alpha (Tru64, OpenVMS, Non-Stop Clusters,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Advanced Server, compilers, SRM, board designs,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chipset designs, CPU designs, patents, etc). 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; How freaking stupid is Compaq's management?  Intel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; can't even get a first generation ia-64 product out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the door.  Does anyone really think they will 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have a next generation processor available by 2004. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Talk about being sold on marketing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Intel did one hell of a sales job on Compaq for Compaq
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to risk losing its most loyal following in some very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; high profit segments on the &quot;promise&quot; that IA64 will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rule the world.  Trading a proven platform for an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unproven platform after publicly denouncing the IA64
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; design in favor of Alpha and then dumping the port
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effort of Tru64 UNIX to IA64 shortly after.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is a 180 degree reversal of both the dismissal of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IA64 and the current lack of a &quot;Alpha peer&quot; in either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; performance or robustness.  Compilers for IA64 still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a lot of growing up to do, as do the platforms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that run under them. Alpha was introduced slowly with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; VAX forming the underpinnings.  This move looks more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like cannibalization.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 2)  How much of future Alpha design is inside of API
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; now?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Samsung, through API, owns design patents on Alpha and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; indeed enjoy a high degree of autonomy. What I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know is if the patents include the all important
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; patents for SRM/PALcode and the obvious need to share
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some of this information with Compaq to consolidate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certain platform plans.  API has it's own chipset in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; th works to replace the aging Tsunami which differed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from Compaq's slated Titan II.  Presumably, API could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; survive by using it's &quot;Linux in ROM&quot; and using legacy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; PALcode, at least for a time. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; API seems to have been forced to be an all Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; hardware company with this announcement.  Which 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; makes their work for gcc 3.0
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; improvements very 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; important.  Personally I'm only buying Linux stuff,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; so Compaq leaving isn't 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that big of a deal.  UNLESS this really going to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; affect future design 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; improvements by API.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They were officially Linux anyway. It just so happened
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some of their systems were Tru64 compliant, though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Compaq was eliminating support for newer support
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hardware (storage, network and video controllers).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Comments anyone? I feel like going home to stare at my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; three Alpha's for a time, sobbing.
