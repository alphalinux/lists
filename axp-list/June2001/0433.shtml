<EM>&gt; I am attempting to upgrade a RH6.2 install to a RH7.1.  However, It keeps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; telling me that / needs to be fscked.  I went to the shell, to see if I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can fsck it and none of my 6.2 paritions work with this version of fsck.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hm, on my test box I do have a mixture of partitions created and
<BR>
formatted in different times and, for a bigger attraction, also some
<BR>
disks with BSD labels and some, yet, with FAT-style partition tables.
<BR>
Moreover I have boot either something which started as RH 6.2 and
<BR>
another installation which is basically 7.1 (the latest, admittedly, the
<BR>
latest pre-release cut but it should not really differ from what
<BR>
eventually showed up on servers).  Both installations mount and fsck
<BR>
partitions from another one and I still would have to see something like
<BR>
what you describe.  Some of file systems on these partitition were layed
<BR>
out probably in 5.x times and maybe even earlier.  My e2fsprogs from 7.1
<BR>
(this package includes fsck) identify itself as 1.19-5.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yet, my system boots, works, and fscks fine under RH6.2.  Does anyone know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what this would be happening?
</EM><BR>
<P>Unless somebody seriously broke something in the last minute, which you
<BR>
should promptly report on bugzilla, then no.  Do you have any error
<BR>
messages?  Especially when running in a verbose mode?  Besides e2fsprogs
<BR>
have a number utilities which can provide an information how details
<BR>
of a filesystem are seen.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm not ready to wipe and start fresh.  Is there a way around this?
</EM><BR>
<P>I would compile myself a sane version of e2fsprogs if the one you have
<BR>
is broken.  This HAS to work or something extremely bogus happened.
<BR>
Old kernels may not support some newer features of ext2, so you have to
<BR>
make sure that a file system is not using these if it can be used in
<BR>
such situation, but otherwise various ext2 versions, and their tools,
<BR>
are backwards compatible.
