<EM>&gt; &gt; Once again Compaq has shown a typical lack of long term planning.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Reading between lines this also smells to me like an admission from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Intel that they have big troubles with Itanic.  Especially that time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;scales mentioned in all these annoucements sound like ethernity in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this business.  More so if you remember Intel pronoucements from,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;when it was - four or five years ago, that Merced (it was called that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;way at that time, right?) is &quot;right behind the corner&quot;.  If everything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will go as planned (a very big IF) I would would be not very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;surprised to find out that future ia-64 variants look awfully close
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to a rebadged Alpha. :-)  But in these years ahead they are talking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about we can still see quite a few other sharp turns.  Enjoy the ride!
</EM><BR>
<P>Absolutely. But thanks to Compaq they got everything they wanted:
<BR>
Alpha technology to make Itanium work.
<BR>
Compaq to abandon Alpha in the long run. Even though it is clear it will 
<BR>
take at least 2 years, and more likely 4 to do this, it effectively kills 
<BR>
Alpha sales from now on.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Compaq is quite interesting with &quot;we are not making anymore but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we are still making for a while&quot; on the referenced page.  Still the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;biggest kick one can get from &quot;read what our customers are saying&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in that place. :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, and that is a big factor. a LOT of companies they supply want them to 
<BR>
do only X86, as it is cheaper, and more &quot;mainstream&quot;.
<BR>
Frankly Michal, this was inevitable.
<BR>
The bitch of it is that Samsung now loses their biggest customer for Alpha CPUs
<BR>
Are they going to invest in making EV7 or later? I doubt it.
<BR>
<P>Which will cut us out of the Alpha market.. how soon I don't know.
