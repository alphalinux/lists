<P>Uh.  Redhat ditches Apache for IIS?  Where is this from?
<BR>
<P>Back on that Alpha/Intel thing.  It's pretty well understood that VLIW 
<BR>
architectures require intensive compiler work.  So my idea of Intel's main 
<BR>
job in all of this . . .
<BR>
One: An attempt to weaken and get rid of a competitor. (obvious)
<BR>
and
<BR>
Two: Get a compiler to produce code that makes the (t)itanic perform closer 
<BR>
to the theory of the design.  (which *in theory* isn't a bad design)
<BR>
<P>The Digital people do have a history of making great compilers and tools for 
<BR>
advanced processors (FX32, ccc, spike, etc).  Which leads to the next 
<BR>
statistics question . .
<BR>
What percentage of engineers jumping ship is required to make Intel's 
<BR>
investment in orginal Digital code go to crap?  :)
<BR>
<P>I still can't get my head around what the hell Compaq gets out of this.  It 
<BR>
can not be humanly possible to port their tools, OpenVMS, AND True64 to an 
<BR>
ia-64 type system that doesn't even exist yet in only 3 years.  And how much 
<BR>
will that cost?  The entire distribution of RedHat 7.1 is estimated to be 
<BR>
over 1 Billion dollars.  Porting two operating systems and all of the tools 
<BR>
can not be any cheaper than that.
<BR>
<P>Anyways, enough of this.  I'm going home to turn off all of my computers and 
<BR>
crawl around on the floor with my kids.  I don't care how much money Intel 
<BR>
pumps into the ia-64, it will never be as fast as my 10 month old son 
<BR>
crawling for a toy he can destroy.  :)
