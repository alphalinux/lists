<EM>&gt; People often forget it IS Linux, and that distributions are just 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;snapshots&quot; of what a company decided to package at some given point in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time. As progress continues, and nothing stops when a distro is made, it is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; best to consider these as simply &quot;starting points&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Naturally if you are a fan of &quot;Distribution X&quot;, stick to that, as it is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to give you the shortest learning curve to get comfortable.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wouldn't say that all distros are simply &quot;snapshots.&quot; Linux is just a
<BR>
kernel, period. It is true that SOME distributions are not much more
<BR>
then collections of other code put together in a fancy package. Then
<BR>
there are others, Debian for example (just for example), who try and
<BR>
work closely with the upstream authors (and in some cases they ARE the
<BR>
author). Even bugs from the bug tracking system (BTS) is often sent to 
<BR>
the original authors. Not all distros are commercial, and not all 
<BR>
distros are based on a commercial one. Debian (again just for example) 
<BR>
is NOT based on another distro and is not-for-profit. IIRC Debian was 
<BR>
first founded in 1993, but work started in mid to late 1992. Packages in
<BR>
Debian do NOT come from other distros, they come from the original
<BR>
authors. If anything, OTHER distros are based on it. 
<BR>
<P>As several people have said in the past: stick with what you know. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; We do our own distro, called Northern Linux, which is based on Red Hat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We feel that more timely updates are needed for our customers who buy 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machines and support from us, so we add to, and update the Red Hat version.
</EM><BR>
<P>As does Debian. That's why there is security and proposed-updates
<BR>
sections. Those are updated often. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I CAN say that Red Hat has the most history in the Alpha Linux market. That 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is not an endorsement that they are best, however, it is what we have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chosen to start with for several years so far..
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree. Red Hat was first, but that doesn't make them best. I moved
<BR>
away from Red Hat several years ago because their support of Alpha has
<BR>
been weak.
