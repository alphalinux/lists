<P>
I think the main thing to consider in all of this is that Compaq has a need 
<BR>
to continue to support TRU64 and VMS on their hardware. It will certainly 
<BR>
take some time to port the OS to Itanium, and it will also take time for 
<BR>
Itanium to achieve anything resembling Alpha performance, both for existing 
<BR>
and future generations.
<BR>
<P>Here is the quote from the Compaq press release that is both relevant, and 
<BR>
gives a bit of an idea about what lies ahead:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Compaq will immediately begin to port Tru64 UNIX, OpenVMS and NonStop 
<BR>
Kernel operating systems and development tools to the Itanium processor 
<BR>
family. Operating system and application development tools compatibility 
<BR>
protects customers' long-term investments in Tru64 UNIX, OpenVMS, and 
<BR>
NonStop Kernel, as well as advancing the capabilities for Windows 2000 and 
<BR>
Linux on ProLiant.&quot;
<BR>
<P>In other words at least a year, probably 2 or 3 to move the OS over.
<BR>
<P><P>&quot;Technology Transfer
<BR>
Under the multi-year technology agreement, Compaq is transferring 
<BR>
significant Alpha tools and engineering resources to Intel, as well as 
<BR>
granting licenses to Compaq's Alpha microprocessor technology and compilers. &quot;
<BR>
<P>Intel now has access to the technologies and people who can make Itanium 
<BR>
faster.
<BR>
<P><P>&quot;AlphaServer, NonStop, ProLiant Roadmaps
<BR>
Compaq said it will continue to design and build new AlphaServer™ systems 
<BR>
based on current and upcoming Alpha processor technology through 2003.  The 
<BR>
company plans to upgrade the current high-end AlphaServer GS Series with a 
<BR>
1 GHz Alpha processor this summer. The next-generation EV7 Alpha processor, 
<BR>
which is currently under development, will power a new AlphaServer system 
<BR>
planned for introduction late next year. &quot;
<BR>
<P>In other words it will take at least 2 more years to phase out Alpha.
<BR>
<P>Yes, this is the end of Alpha, but not for at least a couple of years.
<BR>
<P>Really I think this will be very good for Alpha products to migrate in to 
<BR>
the &quot;low cost market&quot; that people have been asking for.
<BR>
With the existing cost investment in Alpha, I think Compaq will want to 
<BR>
squeeze every penny it can on what it has already paid for..
<BR>
<P>And for us Linux users the good news is that we will finally reach a point 
<BR>
where we don't have the endless situation where the updates to kernel and 
<BR>
libs lag between x86 and Alpha..
<BR>
