<P>
With regards to your message at 01:48 PM 6/27/01, Uncle George. Where you 
<BR>
stated:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm curious, hows the Canadian Anti-Trust case going against MS? I cant 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;imagine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that MS is just hose'in us USA folks alone - are they?
</EM><BR>
<P>Canadian case? Never heard of it..
<BR>
The province of British Columbia offered MS a deal if they got convicted, 
<BR>
they could move across the border.. &lt;grin&gt;
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;As for myself, i'm not sure of the diff between merging, and simply stopping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;production after so may years. Simply stopping offers no migration path. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Merging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;does provide some transition path - although one might not know that within in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that transition the &quot;bridge is out&quot; sign might get posted to all migratory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;travelers, with no one available to repair the path.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think it is typical stupid shareholder reporting mentality.
<BR>
There is one big thing that is a pain about publicly traded companies: They 
<BR>
have to make shareholders happy, even when it is necessary to do so by 
<BR>
doing the wrong thing.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;just my 2 cents
</EM><BR>
And that's about $0.032 Canadian!
