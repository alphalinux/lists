<EM>&gt; This does not guarantee anything and if a patch is dropped, for

<EM>&gt; a timing is bad.  Other possibility is that they do not conform
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to guidelines from Documentation/CodingStyle.
</EM><BR>
<P>I can definitely say that the latter case is just not true for my patches
<BR>
(I strive for 100% compliance with the coding style...which is more than I
<BR>
can say for most driver submissions that I've seen get accepted and
<BR>
reformatted after the fact).  As for persistence, been there...done
<BR>
that.  I resubmitted one of my documentation patches THREE times on
<BR>
different occasions, only to see them totally ignored.  The excuses that I
<BR>
frequently got from the few folks that do pass Alan's and Linus' filters
<BR>
were that i386 was most important and that my patches would need to be
<BR>
reviewed to make sure that they didn't interfere with normal operation on
<BR>
i386 (which made ZERO sense considering the fact that they were
<BR>
DOCUMENTATION patches!).  This is also true for other patches as well
<BR>
(those to bring Alpha up-to-date with various changes made to the kernel
<BR>
source...read: include/linux header changes...for the primary benefit of
<BR>
i386).  Patches containing the SAME EXACT CODE were accepted from other
<BR>
people at a much later date, but mine were completely ignored.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yes, some proposed changes vanish without any apparent good explanation.
</EM><BR>
<P>The best explanation that I've found so far is that most of us 'unwashed
<BR>
masses' aren't important enough for Alan or Linus to even glance at our
<BR>
emails.  Hell, in two instances that I can remember, they BOTH read and
<BR>
responded to threads that surrounded my submission time-wise, but never
<BR>
saw fit to review my patches.
