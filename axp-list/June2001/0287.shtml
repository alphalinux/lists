<P>
With regards to your message at 10:58 AM 6/25/01, Mark Arrasmith. Where you 
<BR>
stated:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;I just want to understand some of this Compaq/Intel crap.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;1) Compaq is selling all of their Alpha tech to Intel and then promising to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;use Intel's future 64bit designs (whatever that may be) for Compaq hardware.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;My problems with this are:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Is the govt going to allow this?
</EM><BR>
<P>Has the government actually STOPPED anything? Microsoft case seems to have 
<BR>
ground to a halt, and they are already convicted. Now the appeals have 
<BR>
follow-up just &quot;melted away&quot;
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;What happens to purely Compaq products? (SRM, OpenVMS, True64, Compaq's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;compilers, etc)
</EM><BR>
<P>Compaq claims that they will port those to the merged IA64/Alpha tech.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;How freaking stupid is Compaq's management?  Intel can't even get a first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;generation ia-64 product out the door.  Does anyone really think they will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have a next generation processor available by 2004.  Talk about being sold on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;marketing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Can't afford to compete as a box-pusher against Dell. And they have to cut 
<BR>
costs to make bottom line in short term look nicer to shareholders. Poor 
<BR>
planning, but shareholder driven.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;2)  How much of future Alpha design is inside of API now?
</EM><BR>
<P>Really none. API makes some boards that they designed/contracted out.
<BR>
Chipsets are all Compaq/DEC products. CPUs are all Samsung. Single CPU 
<BR>
board designs are all Samsung. Fab is all foundry/contracted stuff.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;API seems to have been forced to be an all Linux hardware company with this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;announcement.  Which makes their work for gcc 3.0 improvements very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;important.  Personally I'm only buying Linux stuff, so Compaq leaving isn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that big of a deal.  UNLESS this really going to affect future design
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;improvements by API.
</EM><BR>
<P>Chipsets are the issue.
<BR>
<P>Current (EV68)CPUs:
<BR>
Samsung and IBM both make Alpha CPUs, as long as they have a customer base 
<BR>
to sell to.
<BR>
Right now the Samsung customers are Compaq (diminishing) and API, and other 
<BR>
OEMs.
<BR>
IBM customer is Compaq, which will shrink as Intel eventually takes over. 
<BR>
This will be quite a while to reach, as I see it..
<BR>
<P>Future(EV7 and on) CPUs:
<BR>
As I understand it the agreement with Compaq due to the terms of licensing 
<BR>
grants Samsung the access to technology at least through EV7 designs.
<BR>
Question is if they are motivated to produce these in the future. Compaq 
<BR>
has started buying CPUs from IBM, and that cuts away their biggest customer.
<BR>
<P>Board chipsets for bridges, memory controllers, etc.
<BR>
There have been promises of new chipsets floating about for quite a while, 
<BR>
but little has come of it except in the larger multi (over 4) CPU designs. 
<BR>
Samsung has been forced to use chipsets from AMD to make the new DDR UP1500 
<BR>
board.
<BR>
Compaq's new designs are now basically 2 years late already. We are still 
<BR>
using the same chipset for dual boards for the last 3 years.
<BR>
<P>API have announced they are doing something with Lightning Data Transport 
<BR>
chips, and AMD have announced that this is the path they are on now, and 
<BR>
have abandoned the  successors to Tsunami, probably mostly because they are 
<BR>
still not available (see above comment).
<BR>
How much is this API technology and how much Samsung remains to be seen. It 
<BR>
is rumoured that Samsung have been grooming API to go IPO this year.. 
<BR>
Adding some small &quot;crown jewels&quot; adds to the viability of this move. API 
<BR>
have not yet announced any customers or board designs utilizing this yet, 
<BR>
but perhaps we will see some announcements in the future?
<BR>
<P>The feeling we are getting from Samsung is that they are hoping to find OEM 
<BR>
customers to manufacture the UP1x00 boards for their own use, and Samsung 
<BR>
simply wants to keep manufacturing CPUs and simplifying their work. I think 
<BR>
they are taking a long hard look at whether or not there is really a market 
<BR>
for them.
<BR>
<P>Bottom line is that there is still a healthy Alpha market, even with the 
<BR>
delays we have seen. I hope that one of the players is sufficiently well 
<BR>
enough funded to continue to make headway.
<BR>
<P>Time will tell..
<BR>
