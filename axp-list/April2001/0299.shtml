<EM>&gt; We used to build and sell a basic LX with RAM, HD, CDROM, floppy, video for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; $1700
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The LX was a 533 with 2MB cache and 1GB RAM capacity, and the UX version
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with 1.5GB capacity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On the LX I had SRM, UNIX options.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And on the LX I had 64bit PCI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This was in 1998.
</EM><BR>
<P>When I built my LX in 98 it cost me almost $2700 for a 533MHz CPU 2M L3,
<BR>
128MB, 4GB SCSI disk, 2940UW, permedia2, DE500 nic, and a SB64 ISA.
<BR>
Anyone
<BR>
using IDE was in for abysmal disk performance considering the state of
<BR>
the
<BR>
linux kernel at that time. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Today in 2001 the similar config in a UP1100 costs $2600
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The UP1100 is a 600MHz with 768MB RAM capacity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On the UP1100 I have 32 bit PCI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On the UP1100 I have Linux only.
</EM><BR>
<P>and back when the LX's where out in 98 how many 64 bit PCI cards
<BR>
where 1) within the reach of most consumers 2) practical? Nevermind
<BR>
the price of ram. Nowadays 512MB ECC can be had for less than $500.
<BR>
How many people need more than that for workstation applications? 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; In three years we have gained what? 66MHz and $900 cost increase..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Taking into account 21264 versus 21164A I am sure the new one is faster.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I hope so.. although from a memory bandwidth point of view it is not any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; faster.
</EM><BR>
<P>FP is twice as fast aslong as its in cache. Disk access from PCI
<BR>
adapters seem faster
<BR>
(I have almost Identical SCSI setups between my LX and UP1000 at work
<BR>
and 
<BR>
the 1000 is twice as fast). Now you want to play the MHz game? For what
<BR>
the 1000 lacked in memory bandwidth the gap could be closed with a
<BR>
larger
<BR>
cache. For example one of my 600/4 LX's was outperforming the UP1100 (2M
<BR>
cache)
<BR>
by some 40 mins using seti@home!
