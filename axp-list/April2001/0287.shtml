<P>Yup.. thank God for ctrl-d in mutt! (-; Next step would be to filter
<BR>
out the address, but it was taken care of before I got to that...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What confuses me is the hypocrites I'm seeing on this list. The UP1000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; developers discount for a complete system cost $3000. Then the UP1100
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; came out,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To build that up to a complete system you're looking at $2800-$3000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bucks. Now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 1500 is comming, It's supposedly going to cost around the same as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; UP1100
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so a complete system again will cost between $2800-$3000 bucks. My
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; question is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what stopped you 2 years ago from buying a UP1000 that has changed &quot;now&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1500 is rolling out? It has more memory bandwidth? woohoo! Irongate 1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had  as much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memory bandwidth as Pyxis so it wasnt any dog. A UP1000 was still twice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as fast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as an LX in every way. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I've sat back on this thread until now. Watching these &quot;hypocrites&quot; it
<BR>
seems to me they are, yet again, comparing Alphas to the x86
<BR>
market. As sad as it may be, Alphas will NEVER be in the same price
<BR>
range as ANY x86. x86s use cheaply parts; they are low quality and
<BR>
high quantity. And honostly I hope Alphas are never where x86s
<BR>
currently are. However I very much would like to see Alpha displace
<BR>
SUN and the PowerPC for both workstation and servers. Then Intel's
<BR>
64-bit processor if that ever goes anywhere...
<BR>
<P>Things will be very different with Intel's 64-bit Pile of Sludge. Why?
<BR>
Because it's 1.0 baby! Version 1.0 processor, version 1.0 compilers,
<BR>
version 1.0 users, etc. From what I've seen so far with the
<BR>
performance of Itanium (or whatever they are calling it this week),
<BR>
Intel has a TON more work needed. Here is where Alpha wins, (to coin
<BR>
an overused phrase) it's &quot;been there, done that.&quot; We are currently on
<BR>
the second revision of the third generation (someone correct me here,
<BR>
only on my second cup of coffee...) The starting pricing for Itanium
<BR>
seems to be at about $8,000 USD. The starting price for a similarly
<BR>
configured Alpha is $3,000 +/-
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you &quot;really&quot; wanted one you would have bought one already! Hell, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; went
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; broke buying my first LX in pieces 3 years ago when I was just starting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; college 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instead of buying a car.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well here I see two groups. I'm with ya on this, but that falls under
<BR>
&quot;geek factor&quot; and not &quot;business factor&quot; I did the same thing, I saved
<BR>
up and built my first Alpha piece by piece (a 21064). Except for those
<BR>
companies who specifically need an Alpha, how many are going to buy a
<BR>
$3,000+ Alpha when they can buy a similarly configured Athlon for
<BR>
$1,000 - $1,500 ? I would like to see that $3,000 Alpha cost $2,000.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Exactly. Folks who want to run Tru64 are already using Tru64. Most 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; users
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; couldnt care about Tru64. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't care about running Tru64, however I would very much like to be
<BR>
able to run more binaries in Linux (threads anyone?) I suspect if
<BR>
people have enough money to buy a Tru64 license (business), they are
<BR>
probably going to buy something from Compaq. IMO the important OSes
<BR>
are Linux, FreeBSD, and NetBSD. However perhaps a poll of customers to
<BR>
know for sure? A free software/open source clone of SRM would probably
<BR>
help here...
<BR>
<P>JMO &amp;&amp; JMMV,
<BR>
