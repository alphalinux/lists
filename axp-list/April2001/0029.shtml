<EM>&gt; The Tsunami\Typhoon method of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using a segmented chipset of CIA (System controller), DSW (Data slice) and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; PCI chipsets means better flexibility for system board design but jacks up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the price quite a bit and makes the implementation at lot more costly.
</EM><BR>
<P>However, AMD is moving to precisely that model with Hype[rd]Transport,
<BR>
and API just announced a chip that links to Hype[rd]Transport. So
<BR>
apparently the AMD folks think they can control the cost, and API is
<BR>
interested in doing that. What you will get on the low end is an open
<BR>
question, though, since your low-cost wishlist has some features that
<BR>
low-cost x86 boxes typically don't have.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; EV7 should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; integrate more of the system chipset on die (I think this is limited to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memory controller, which I've heard is being &quot;strategically&quot; redisigned for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support of DDR SDRAM, not just the DRDRAM/RDRAM that they had originally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; planned), but I'm not certain if that will include I/O bus support, like the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; high speed serial Infiniband (though it may).   
</EM><BR>
<P>Both Infiniband and Hype[rd]Transport are as suitable for putting on
<BR>
the cpu die as the RAMBUS controllers that Compaq has been promising
<BR>
for EV7.
