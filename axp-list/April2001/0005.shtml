<EM>&gt; &gt;You've got that right.  Like you, I'm waiting to see the results of the IBM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;fabbing of the Alpha. They are a good source for silicon, Sun Ecache debacle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;aside.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even IBM fab. Alpha CPU, who is going to assemble into SlotB or something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like that?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or Who would make planner?
</EM><BR>
<P>Who said you have to stay with the slot B package? UP1100 and CS20 have
<BR>
CPU's
<BR>
soldered to the motherboard. Where you get your &quot;parts&quot; from is doesnt
<BR>
matter.
<BR>
Bottom line. What does it cost? What am I using it for? What else do I
<BR>
need? 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe there is no reason to go back in 164, no way... it is cheaper now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to create
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; UP1500 than 164 system.
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe there was no reason to leave EV56 to begin with. It's been 3-4
<BR>
years
<BR>
now and how much has the price come down on EV6? UP1100 cost 2K retail.
<BR>
UP1500 is
<BR>
rumored to cost the same . Availability of UP1100 has been a problem in
<BR>
the 
<BR>
US and hence people didnt buy them. So you're still talking 3K for a
<BR>
complete system.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If you want AGP, you can't use Tsunami/Typhoon (a pricey chipset that's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;great for servers), leaving the AMD and VIA chipsets as the only options.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I thought Compaq is working on AGP support for ES45...VX1 AGP for Tru64...
</EM><BR>
<P>And irongate is here now. Honestly, I'm not concerned with Tru64 or SRM
<BR>
for
<BR>
that matter. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;- Wait and see how the UP1500 does and go from there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't hope for re-fabbing 164, but waiting to see this UP1500 to come
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; down the price
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by the end of this year....crossing my fingers.
</EM><BR>
<P>Another year of waiting. How many folks where crossing their fingers
<BR>
when the
<BR>
UP1000 came out? Waiting for the price to come down. The API stopped
<BR>
selling them...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; And stable supply of 833 slotB that makes more sense to HPTC.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>HPTC is not the target market here. Professionals who want workstation
<BR>
performance 
<BR>
for moderate science and programming exercises.
