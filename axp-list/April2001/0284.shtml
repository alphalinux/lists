Low-CostAlphaPlatform   Suggestion

<P><EM>&gt; Reason API bailed on UP1100 is they were overpriced for what you got. Sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it has a decent CPU, but NO memory bandwidth or decent capacity.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's not my place to answer this.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; UP1500 looks MUCH better.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But API did not help much as they only brought in the 600MHz and not the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 700MHz. Samsung still sells them and they are readily available.
</EM><BR>
<P>What confuses me is the hypocrites I'm seeing on this list. The UP1000
<BR>
with the
<BR>
developers discount for a complete system cost $3000. Then the UP1100
<BR>
came out,
<BR>
To build that up to a complete system you're looking at $2800-$3000
<BR>
bucks. Now
<BR>
the 1500 is comming, It's supposedly going to cost around the same as a
<BR>
UP1100
<BR>
so a complete system again will cost between $2800-$3000 bucks. My
<BR>
question is
<BR>
what stopped you 2 years ago from buying a UP1000 that has changed &quot;now&quot;
<BR>
that the 
<BR>
1500 is rolling out? It has more memory bandwidth? woohoo! Irongate 1
<BR>
had  as much
<BR>
memory bandwidth as Pyxis so it wasnt any dog. A UP1000 was still twice
<BR>
as fast
<BR>
as an LX in every way. 
<BR>
<P><P>If you &quot;really&quot; wanted one you would have bought one already! Hell, I
<BR>
went
<BR>
broke buying my first LX in pieces 3 years ago when I was just starting
<BR>
college 
<BR>
instead of buying a car.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What I am seeing our customers ask for  this:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Give us a machine like the LX was in it's time. Reasonably priced, fast,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and flexible.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>It's more like &quot;I want everything for nothing and no comprimises
<BR>
please&quot;. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; We should see that with the UP1500. Pity about the lack of UNIX but then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this is becoming more irrelevant every day.
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly. Folks who want to run Tru64 are already using Tru64. Most 
<BR>
users
<BR>
couldnt care about Tru64.
