I couldn't tell ya how much a 6 CPU alpha system costs. The E3500 fully
<BR>
configured is well over US$ 150k though (w/ 8CPUs and 8GB RAM). That's of
<BR>
course not cheating out the power supplies to a non-Sun vendor. (which you
<BR>
couldn't do w/ Compaq because either they don't exist or would void the
<BR>
plastic shrink-wrap warnings)
<BR>
<P>As far as the sun blade 1000 goes, if it's really that slow, is it worth
<BR>
spending the money to have one other than just the geek factor of having
<BR>
one? If it was just for geek factor, you could go on eBay and buy a multia,
<BR>
LX/SX/UX/ etc. If you want to really get work done, well then you need to
<BR>
spend some money.
<BR>
<P>any of the higher end systems are not going to be super cheap no matter
<BR>
which chip / chipset you decide to go with.

<P><EM>&gt; and sun isn't exactly cheap either if you want a decent performing

much
<BR>
<EM>&gt; as a 750MHz/8MB SlotB (and the alpha will blow the sun away).

<P>Yeah, I've got one application in radiative transfer where
<BR>
500MHz DS20/Tru64/CompaqC goes 8 times faster then 400 MHz
<BR>
E450/Sol7/SC. 1GB memory usage/1 CPU run.
<BR>
It seems Alpha does very good with 2 adds/2 mults per cycle
<BR>
in the inner loop of 5 (3 spatial+2angular dims).
<BR>
And not less important, Compaq C could make a good use of it.
<BR>
<P>However, truth to be told, what would be the price of 6 CPU
<BR>
Alpha computer, comparing to the 3500 :-(( ?
<BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The reviews I've heard of the sun blade 1000 compare it to running like a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; celeron. (and I can get a celeron a lot cheaper than the Sun).
</EM><BR>
<P>In the application above, Sun C really sucked in scheduling.
<BR>
I wouldn't surprised if a part of blade's problems was because
<BR>
of a bad C compiler.
