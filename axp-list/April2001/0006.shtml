<EM>&gt; You've got that right.  Like you, I'm waiting to see the results of the IBM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fabbing of the Alpha. They are a good source for silicon, Sun Ecache debacle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aside.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm curious what exactly makes EV6 expensive, besides that all
<BR>
configurations available have 2MB cache or more.  If somebody were to
<BR>
offer a low-cost 1MB version, it would fill a need but also diminish much
<BR>
of the reason for buying an alpha in the first place: performance.  (Don't
<BR>
flame me because I don't think OpenVMS is a reason!)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Who would fab the 21164A/21164PCx parts?  Mitsubishi fabbed 21164PC for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time, they could pick it up again if they could make some profit off of it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have a weird hunch that everbody involved with the 21164PC lost money on
<BR>
it.  Some are gone.  Why would they try again?
<BR>
<P>I realize you might buy one.  Some might I.  I'm going to get an EV6 (if I
<BR>
ever sell my house).  But that doesn't help much unless you can somehow
<BR>
convince half the Sun owners they need an Alpha.
<BR>
<P>I'd personally love to see an appliance.  We bought a number of the little
<BR>
Cobalt servers.  Every one MIPS-based, every one still in
<BR>
service.  They're great.  I was disappointed when they abandoned
<BR>
MIPS (QED, actually) even though the K6 was a much better performer.  I
<BR>
like diversity in an increasingly all-x86 world.  It gave me a platform to
<BR>
show people, &quot;Look, you do a 'configure; make; make install' and voila! No
<BR>
need to wait for a MIPS port&quot;.  You see, I love free software, which
<BR>
thrives on heterogeneity.
<BR>
<P>Now they are owned by Sun, and, well... let's say it's an x86 or SPARC
<BR>
world out there.  Maybe PPC too.  Possibly IA-64.  (Or probably not.  It'd
<BR>
be humiliating though if crap like the Itanic overtakes alpha in volume,
<BR>
but that's probably unavoidable.)
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Given the lower production numbers, I'd be happy to see one of these in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; $1,500 to $1,900 range.  A .18 micron 21164A with an 8MB L3 should do nicely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at 1GHz. : )
</EM><BR>
<P>Can you touch anything with 8MB cache for $2k, let alone Alpha?  I don't
<BR>
know, but I'm skeptical.
<BR>
<P>It's frustrating that the vendors are so silent on these issues, not that
<BR>
I expect them to divulge business plans.  But it's probably safe to say
<BR>
that all the players would agree this is fine and dandy as long as
<BR>
somebody's paying for it.
<BR>
<P>Digital's efforts at marketing low-cost Alpha were a dismal failure in
<BR>
spite of their technical merits.  Say what you want about their marketing,
<BR>
but this whole thread has been focused on the technology, hmm... little
<BR>
bit of deja vu.
<BR>
<P>Meanwhile, you can still get a UP1100 mainboard w/ CPU for $2k, but how
<BR>
many people on this thread have bought one?  Talk is cheap.
<BR>
<P>So many have lost so much on Alpha I wouldn't expect any takers.
