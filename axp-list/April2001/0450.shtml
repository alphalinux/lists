Re Emulex support - strange that Emulex say that hey will not support Alpha
<BR>
Linux as the DEC/Compaq KGPSA is an Emulex 64Bit Fiberchannel  card

<EM>&gt; &gt; Hello,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Does anyone know if there is a Fiberchannel card that works under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Alpha linux?  I recall some discussions a while back about using an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Emulex LPFC8000, but the closest thing I could find on their site is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a driver for Pentium linux.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We have been trying to get some stable fiber channel support to work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; under Alpha (XP1000, linux 2.2.XX, currently 19) at our site here for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some time.  I have not seen any support for the Emulex driver for Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux. When a colleague contacted Emulex directly they indicated they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had no plans to support Alpha.  This was 3 months ago.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We have Qlogic 2200 cards here.  There are 3 driver options for you on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this one:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   1) Qlogic (www.qlogic.com)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   2) UNH    (not sure, but it is the driver that is in the kernel source)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   3) Feral  (www.feral.com)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have spent most of my time with 1 and 3.  I have not tried the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; driver from UNH.  There have been some problems with data corruption
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when the machine is under heavy load for (1) and (2).  I have seen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it happen for (1), and GFS reported the problem for (2).  For qlogic's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; driver, that was relevant to version 2.XX.  It seems that version
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4.XX-beta no longer has the driver corruption.  Also, qlogic's 4.XX-beta
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually acknowledges the Alpha platform and will compile cleanly which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the older drivers would not do.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To test for corruption,  I would execute numerous dd commands and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simultaneous kernel compiles on different file systems on one node
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for ext2 and on several nodes for GFS (Global File System,
</EM><BR>
www.sistina.com)
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I think that I isolated the problem to only reads off of the FC device as
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; kernel compiles would always fail in different places after untarring the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; directory.  When there was no load I could compile the kernel
</EM><BR>
successfully.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The 3rd driver shows promise.  It is from Feral Software,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Matt Jacob is the author.  I was having much better luck with that driver
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before I got the latest qlogic driver.   There was no data corruption with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this driver but some of the GFS authors reported some SMP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; issues.  The latest driver is having some problems as Matt is trying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to redo some code relating to card initialization (I don't remember
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the specifics).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The last 2 weeks I have been mounting an ext2 filesystem from an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; XP1000 with 2GB of ram on linux 2.2.19 and the Qlogic qla2x00-4.24Beta
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; driver.  The machine has hung once in that time.  I am also exporting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the filesystem with NFS to 30 nodes over myrinet-ip.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Performance is a big issue as well.  I know that I should be able
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to max out the FC link from the XP1000 to our SAN.  There is other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traffic on the SAN but I have never gotten better than 55 MB/s for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; writes and 35 MB/s reads for an ext2 file system. There was other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; activity on the system   Our SAN should be able to max out the FC link
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (100Mb/s theoretical).  Performance on an SGI is 90 MB/s for writes and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 50 MB/s for reads (xfs vs. ext2, but I don't think the performance should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be that different, but I could be wrong).  We can max out the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SAN with multiple clients accessing different filesystems for ext2 or the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same filesystem under GFS.  I tried an older version of the Feral driver
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and single node performance results weren't any better.  Writes were worse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slightly and reads were about the same.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I want to try out linux 2.4.XX and see if the direct-IO patches
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can help with the performance.  Kernel 2.4.3 has some build problems for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alpha.  I am aware of the patches from Andrea that are supposed to fix
</EM><BR>
them
<BR>
<EM>&gt; but I have not had success and I have not had time to figure out what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the problem really is.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; One follow-on question has to do with SAN type environments.  If I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; created an ext2 file system on a disk partition using Alpha linux,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would a Pentium linux system be able to mount and use it?  In other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; words, are the ext2 file systems for both systems the same format?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I never have tried this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For more information, you can look around the GFS site (www.sistina.com)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as they have a lot of experience with FC channel drivers.  Mostly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; x86 but some alpha.  In the Changelogs of each release
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the GFS authors provide some information about different FC drivers and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their experiences with them.
