<P>
Kurt,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;if you go to sunstore and look at prices:
</EM><BR>
<P>Buying from Sun gets you what you get when buying direct from Compaq (where
<BR>
possible): heavy duty prices and some assurance that the equipment won't be
<BR>
too damaged when you receive it.
<BR>
<P><P>ultra60 configuration
<BR>
(w/ 512MB RAM and 2x 450MHz/4MB CPUs) you're talking $16k
<BR>
<P>Authorized resellers are strongly pushed to have a particular price,
<BR>
unauthorized resellers are not.  If you want to have support on your gear
<BR>
though, it will have to be authorized and approved by a Sun tech. All
<BR>
measures of trying the keep the quality high (with associated margin
<BR>
increases).  PC Servers are often not sold this way, many people can't
<BR>
justify the added expense and feel confident their onsite guys can support
<BR>
it as well/better than a support rep technician when the chips are down.
<BR>
Having the ability to buy an off-the-shelf replacement component from any of
<BR>
several dozen (if not hundred) local companies or large warehouses gives
<BR>
some people a greater sense of comfort than depending on the original vendor
<BR>
for similar levels of support.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;if you look at an ultra5, it's around $2800
</EM><BR>
<P>Can be had for much less elsewhere, and Sun Authorized as well.  Average
<BR>
cost is about $1700.00
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;if you look at an ultra10, it's around $4500
</EM><BR>
<P>Average cost from other authorized vendors is $3000, from &quot;unauthorized&quot;
<BR>
resellers, its more like $1600.00 (great for testing, if you don't need
<BR>
direct bronze support on the box).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;sun blade 1000's w/ 2 CPUs are like $20k
</EM><BR>
<P>Similar to  the original cost of the Ultra 60 and quite close to the
<BR>
DS20/DS20E.  Sun Blade 1000, btw, is Ultra III 600MHz or faster, not the old
<BR>
Ultra II platforms.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;and sun blade 100's (the celeron equivs... due to compilers / chipset /
</EM><BR>
latency / whatever) are around $3k for a decent 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;config.
</EM><BR>
<P>While it may be possible to build a $3000 Sun Blade 100, average cost for
<BR>
256MB versions is less than $1800.  Average cost from some (including
<BR>
promotions) is only slightly higher than the Netra X1 (which shares much of
<BR>
the same architecture) at or below $1,000.
<BR>
<P>--KE
