Tony,
<BR>
<P>You've stated my original &quot;prospective&quot; requirements in summary very well.
<BR>
Like me, you included the desired support for OpenVMS and Tru64.
<BR>
Unfortunately, the previously mentioned issues of supported hardware is a
<BR>
major hurdle to building a system that could support Tru64 and OpenVMS as
<BR>
easily as Linux and even xBSD.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;some PCI slots to run dual monitors, SCSI, etc. ( is 66MHz, 64bit PCI out
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt;the question? )
</EM><BR>
<P>Apparently, the AMD 761 Iron Gate can't do 66 MHz PCI (at least not from
<BR>
what I've read), though I suppose you could implement an external PCI bridge
<BR>
that could do the 64 bit/66 MHz.  IBM makes an excellent PCI set just for
<BR>
the purpose, but it would be a bit messy and cost more than our target
<BR>
$1,500-$1,900 price range would allow.  Dual peer PCI buses would be very
<BR>
nice with full 64 bit/66 (or faster support), but its only going to happen
<BR>
if someone like VIA comes up with a single chip low cost chipset that has
<BR>
dual PCI bus and/or 66MHz support built in. The Tsunami\Typhoon method of
<BR>
using a segmented chipset of CIA (System controller), DSW (Data slice) and
<BR>
PCI chipsets means better flexibility for system board design but jacks up
<BR>
the price quite a bit and makes the implementation at lot more costly.
<BR>
Alcor/Alcor II and Pyxis both integrated the PCI and memory controllers to
<BR>
reduce costs but only supported a single 33 MHz PCI bus.  EV7 should
<BR>
integrate more of the system chipset on die (I think this is limited to the
<BR>
memory controller, which I've heard is being &quot;strategically&quot; redisigned for
<BR>
support of DDR SDRAM, not just the DRDRAM/RDRAM that they had originally
<BR>
planned), but I'm not certain if that will include I/O bus support, like the
<BR>
high speed serial Infiniband (though it may).   
<BR>
