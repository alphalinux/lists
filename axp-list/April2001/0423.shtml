Greetings all,
<BR>
<P>As many of us are aware, the &quot;Tulip&quot; based network controllers are becoming
<BR>
a rarity, but for boot level support from SRM and across all of the support
<BR>
operating systems, they are still the way to go.
<BR>
<P>Compiled here are a list of controllers with Tulip chipsets.  I don't have
<BR>
the full list, so if anyone knows others, add those you have discovered. All
<BR>
of these should have full support for the generic &quot;Tulip&quot; driver, most will
<BR>
also support the DEC 21x4x drivers directly.  Looks like Tulip generic
<BR>
drivers are the way to go following this lists threads.
<BR>
<P>Note that these products are all discontinued and my prices may be a little
<BR>
high for what some are available for on auction sites.
