With regards to your message at 01:03 PM 4/10/01, Peter Petrakis. Where you

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;You've got that right.  Like you, I'm waiting to see the results of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the IBM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;fabbing of the Alpha. They are a good source for silicon, Sun Ecache 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; debacle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;aside.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Even IBM fab. Alpha CPU, who is going to assemble into SlotB or something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; like that?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or Who would make planner?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Who said you have to stay with the slot B package? UP1100 and CS20 have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;CPU's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;soldered to the motherboard. Where you get your &quot;parts&quot; from is doesnt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;matter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Bottom line. What does it cost? What am I using it for? What else do I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;need?
</EM><BR>
<P>SlotB is expensive. That is why AMD bailed out of the Slot business and 
<BR>
went to SocketA
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I believe there is no reason to go back in 164, no way... it is cheaper now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to create
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; UP1500 than 164 system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I believe there was no reason to leave EV56 to begin with. It's been 3-4
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;now and how much has the price come down on EV6? UP1100 cost 2K retail.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;UP1500 is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rumored to cost the same . Availability of UP1100 has been a problem in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;US and hence people didnt buy them. So you're still talking 3K for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;complete system.
</EM><BR>
<P>Reason API bailed on UP1100 is they were overpriced for what you got. Sure 
<BR>
it has a decent CPU, but NO memory bandwidth or decent capacity.
<BR>
<P>UP1500 looks MUCH better.
<BR>
<P>But API did not help much as they only brought in the 600MHz and not the 
<BR>
700MHz. Samsung still sells them and they are readily available.
<BR>
<P>What I am seeing our customers ask for  this:
<BR>
&quot;Give us a machine like the LX was in it's time. Reasonably priced, fast, 
<BR>
and flexible.&quot;
<BR>
<P>We should see that with the UP1500. Pity about the lack of UNIX but then 
<BR>
this is becoming more irrelevant every day.
