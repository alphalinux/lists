Ok.... So I got console on the machine, and I noticed in the ARC console
<BR>
that the system time was set to 2031 - So, I corrected that problem by
<BR>
using the correct flags (ARC and UTC time) for the clock settings in RH
<BR>
Linux (/etc/sysconfig/clock).
<BR>
<P>I rebooted the machine, and now that I am back 200 miles from the console
<BR>
again, it is now acting strange again - the same way as described in my
<BR>
original post (see below).
<BR>
<P>I checked my kernel configuration - RTC is not on. I can send the whole
<BR>
config if someone is willing to look it over.
<BR>
<P>Now.. here's what I've now noticed.  It always starts acting strange like
<BR>
this just after the passing of the hour (not EVERY hour, but randomly
<BR>
after the passing of some hour).  In my hourly cron scripts I have a
<BR>
script (that I'm removing to see if that helps!) that sets the system time
<BR>
with rdate, and then writes it to the hardware clock using hwclock.
<BR>
<P>So, is there still some lingering problem with setting the clock under
<BR>
2.2 kernels on alpha? All the mailing list archives seem to indicate the
<BR>
problem is fixed by saying no to RTC. And even then, the problem is only
<BR>
known to happen on SMP machines, which this is not.
<BR>
<P>Any more suggestions? This is obviously some sort of kernel
<BR>
misconfiguration or bug....  Any place better to send this information
<BR>
than this list?
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>

Subject: Strange Behavior; Multia, 2.2.18, RH7
<BR>
<P>Hello,
<BR>
<P>I have a Multia which exhibits very strange behavior under RH7.0
<BR>
with a compiled-by-hand 2.2.18 kernel (no patches applied).
<BR>
<P>At seemingly random times, the machine enters a strange state
<BR>
where no time will pass (log in and repeatedly issuing the 'date'
<BR>
command will yield the same time over and over again).  I can
<BR>
still set the clock with rdate or the date command, but time will
<BR>
not 'flow' again until I get the machine to reboot.  In addition,
<BR>
everything else acts strangely when this happens -- terminal I/O
<BR>
is staggered (type 2 characters - first never comes back until
<BR>
the second is typed...), network connections are randomly locked
<BR>
up (not dropped, just no IO occurs), network processing will
<BR>
sometimes cease all together (ping constantly, and the pings will
<BR>
stop randomly and then start again later -- the network
<BR>
physically has no congestion or problems).
<BR>
<P>The only way that this behavior is corrected is for me to reboot
<BR>
the machine, which until today I was able to do remotely with
<BR>
much work -- usually I had to kill almost all processes by hand;
<BR>
then with a combination of /sbin/reboot, telinit 6, and SIGINT's
<BR>
to init, it would eventually listen to the requests to reboot.
<BR>
<P>But, this time, it has went and killed off all remote access
<BR>
processes, but did not reboot... I'm driving 200 miles to get
<BR>
console on this thing in a few days and reboot it. Does anyone
<BR>
have any idea what may be causing this, something I should try to
<BR>
fix this while I have console to it?
<BR>
<P>If all else fails, I will likely wipe the drive and install RH6.2
<BR>
again, since that worked stable on this exact same hardware
<BR>
configuration (except different SCSI drive - same adapter
<BR>
and cableing, though).
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Jeff
