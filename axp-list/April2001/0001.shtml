<EM>&gt;Tom,                               
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;Ummm...not quite. API's Linux in ROM is not based on the OpenBIOS 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;project. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; Is the project entirely in-house, or did you outsource some of the work? 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;And what in the world does that have to do with the price of tea? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;As with all projects we use whatever mix of in-house and outsourced 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;talent we feel is appropriate for the requirements. And no, we don't 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;disclose this &lt;snip&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I was only curious, I wouldn't be so bold as to ask with whom you were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;were not) working with on any of your projects. I've already been 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;appropriately scolded for such probings. 
</EM><BR>
<P>You can ask whatever you like, this is an unmoderated list. However, just
<BR>
be realistic as to whether you get an answer or not, and whether that
<BR>
answer is true!
