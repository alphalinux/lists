<EM>&gt; What I can point out, however, is the fact that the UP1100 ( and UP1000) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are basically 2.5 to  3 times the cost of the old LX and UX machines. And 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for that we get a platform that is quite nice for many customers, but 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; others are disappointed in the memory performance or capacity.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maurice, I'm not following you here.  An LX cost around $2500 to build
<BR>
at one time.  A UP1100 should be only slightly more.  Sure any remaining
<BR>
LX's are reduced now, but then so will be the UP1100 if any are left in
<BR>
1-2 years.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But realistically the cost of the UP1x00 strikes me as a bit high.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Follow the curve of Alpha vs x86 and SPARC over the last 3 years and you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see the former advantages in clockspeed and price disappearing fast. Time 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was the Alpha single CPU platforms we build enjoyed advantages in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clockspeed, memory bandwidth, memory capacity,  and floating point 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; performance. At a cost of around $2K to $2500 for a basic workstation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now we have the floating point advantage.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks to AMD and Athlon, x86 had a major price/performance war.  Like all
<BR>
wars, the outcome might be good but you don't want to get too close ;)
<BR>
<P>Judging from what Mike Foley and others said, it doesn't seem low cost was
<BR>
a strong consideration in the EV6, or it would probably have had on-die
<BR>
cache.  As with any other engineering decision there are tradeoffs.  Good
<BR>
decision or bad?  You tell me.
<BR>
<P>But getting down to the matter, I am in a postition to recommend Alpha for
<BR>
our hosted solutions if it makes business sense.  I haven't seriously
<BR>
considered it yet.  We buy numerous Sun AXi rack-mount hardware in the
<BR>
range of $3-4k each, all running Solaris.  Price/performance of these is
<BR>
acceptable, not great.  Reliability is essential.  To consider replacing
<BR>
them we'd need solid Java and Oracle support.  Perhaps my mistake is only
<BR>
looking at Linux, not Tru64.  The entry point for Tru64 would be a DS10, I
<BR>
suppose?  Could it possibly be price-competitive with the Suns?  For Alpha
<BR>
OEM I have to look to API, which is Linux only.
