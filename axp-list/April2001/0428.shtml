<P>
I started having problems with what appeared to be disk corruption,
<BR>
when booting Linux I got random errors ranging from unable to mount
<BR>
root if the kernel managed to load, aboot complaining that the kernel
<BR>
image was corrupt and VFS error during booting. I reinstalled Red Hat
<BR>
6.2 and all went fine, then after booting aboot complained about 
<BR>
reading past the EOF or something of that nature. I'd just purchased
<BR>
the AS 1000a a week ago for $NZ750 ($1NZ=$US0.45 or about there) and it
<BR>
had been working fine since. Rather than get pissed off the thought &quot;the
<BR>
CD drive is poked&quot; came to me in a flash. Replaced the CD drive with a
<BR>
slower 2x SCSI, reinstalled and hay presto the machine is purring along
<BR>
very nicely. Rebooted the machine a few times after it had been running
<BR>
for a couple of hours several times and it is still happy. 
<BR>
<P>So I just put the CD drive I suspected of causing the problem into my
<BR>
PC (running Linux) and I can't find any errors. 
<BR>
<P>Question: what the hell is going on ?
