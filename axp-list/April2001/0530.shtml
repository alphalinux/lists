<EM>&gt; Hmm. Pretty similar to what both of mine say. The ONLY difference I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can find between my two ruffians is that one was manufactured by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; samsung (has no problems) and one was manufactured by deskstation (has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ldmilo problems).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;.......
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I did as well, on both systems. *sigh* it'd really be nice to know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; WHAT it is about the one system and not the other that causes problems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with ldmilo... Surely someone must have figured it out by now? Does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any have any idea? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Sigh...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;From what I remember of a glance at the ldmilo source *years* ago,
</EM><BR>
there was a funky little bit of early code that dived into the system
<BR>
and looked at *something* that made it decide one way or the other
<BR>
whether it felt it could run on the system. We never understood what
<BR>
it was looking for or why, and there were no comments.
<BR>
<P>The build environment was also quite funky; it was done under NT with
<BR>
both NT SDK (which at the time was NDA) and some Deskstation headers
<BR>
and such. I didn't do the builds, that was Jim Paradis, hence the
<BR>
&quot;JAY'S HACKED VERSION&quot; message as his way of disclaiming responsibility.
<BR>
<P>;-} ;-}
<BR>
<P>I'm having some difficulty finding the sources I was given, but if I do,
<BR>
perhaps someone can binary-patch the ldmilo.exe in such a way to NOP the
<BR>
problematic test and see if it will run without it on the problem HW.
<BR>
<P>I'll keep looking, but remind me in a few days if you haven't anything
<BR>
more...
