<EM>&gt; Hello,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Does anyone know if there is a Fiberchannel card that works under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha linux?  I recall some discussions a while back about using an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Emulex LPFC8000, but the closest thing I could find on their site is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a driver for Pentium linux.
</EM><BR>
<P>We have been trying to get some stable fiber channel support to work
<BR>
under Alpha (XP1000, linux 2.2.XX, currently 19) at our site here for 
<BR>
some time.  I have not seen any support for the Emulex driver for Alpha 
<BR>
Linux. When a colleague contacted Emulex directly they indicated they
<BR>
had no plans to support Alpha.  This was 3 months ago. 
<BR>
<P>We have Qlogic 2200 cards here.  There are 3 driver options for you on 
<BR>
this one:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Qlogic (www.qlogic.com)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2) UNH    (not sure, but it is the driver that is in the kernel source)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Feral  (www.feral.com)
<BR>
<P>I have spent most of my time with 1 and 3.  I have not tried the
<BR>
driver from UNH.  There have been some problems with data corruption
<BR>
when the machine is under heavy load for (1) and (2).  I have seen
<BR>
it happen for (1), and GFS reported the problem for (2).  For qlogic's
<BR>
driver, that was relevant to version 2.XX.  It seems that version
<BR>
4.XX-beta no longer has the driver corruption.  Also, qlogic's 4.XX-beta
<BR>
actually acknowledges the Alpha platform and will compile cleanly which
<BR>
the older drivers would not do.
<BR>
<P>To test for corruption,  I would execute numerous dd commands and 
<BR>
simultaneous kernel compiles on different file systems on one node
<BR>
for ext2 and on several nodes for GFS (Global File System, www.sistina.com)  
<BR>
I think that I isolated the problem to only reads off of the FC device as the 
<BR>
kernel compiles would always fail in different places after untarring the 
<BR>
directory.  When there was no load I could compile the kernel successfully.  
<BR>
<P>The 3rd driver shows promise.  It is from Feral Software,
<BR>
Matt Jacob is the author.  I was having much better luck with that driver
<BR>
before I got the latest qlogic driver.   There was no data corruption with
<BR>
this driver but some of the GFS authors reported some SMP
<BR>
issues.  The latest driver is having some problems as Matt is trying
<BR>
to redo some code relating to card initialization (I don't remember
<BR>
the specifics).  
<BR>
<P>The last 2 weeks I have been mounting an ext2 filesystem from an
<BR>
XP1000 with 2GB of ram on linux 2.2.19 and the Qlogic qla2x00-4.24Beta
<BR>
driver.  The machine has hung once in that time.  I am also exporting
<BR>
the filesystem with NFS to 30 nodes over myrinet-ip. 
<BR>
<P>Performance is a big issue as well.  I know that I should be able
<BR>
to max out the FC link from the XP1000 to our SAN.  There is other
<BR>
traffic on the SAN but I have never gotten better than 55 MB/s for
<BR>
writes and 35 MB/s reads for an ext2 file system. There was other
<BR>
activity on the system   Our SAN should be able to max out the FC link 
<BR>
(100Mb/s theoretical).  Performance on an SGI is 90 MB/s for writes and
<BR>
50 MB/s for reads (xfs vs. ext2, but I don't think the performance should
<BR>
be that different, but I could be wrong).  We can max out the 
<BR>
SAN with multiple clients accessing different filesystems for ext2 or the 
<BR>
same filesystem under GFS.  I tried an older version of the Feral driver 
<BR>
and single node performance results weren't any better.  Writes were worse 
<BR>
slightly and reads were about the same.
<BR>
<P>I want to try out linux 2.4.XX and see if the direct-IO patches
<BR>
can help with the performance.  Kernel 2.4.3 has some build problems for 
<BR>
alpha.  I am aware of the patches from Andrea that are supposed to fix them
<BR>
but I have not had success and I have not had time to figure out what
<BR>
the problem really is.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One follow-on question has to do with SAN type environments.  If I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; created an ext2 file system on a disk partition using Alpha linux,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would a Pentium linux system be able to mount and use it?  In other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; words, are the ext2 file systems for both systems the same format?
</EM><BR>
<P>I never have tried this.
<BR>
<P>For more information, you can look around the GFS site (www.sistina.com)
<BR>
as they have a lot of experience with FC channel drivers.  Mostly 
<BR>
x86 but some alpha.  In the Changelogs of each release 
<BR>
the GFS authors provide some information about different FC drivers and
<BR>
their experiences with them.
