<EM>&gt; &gt; What I can point out, however, is the fact that the UP1100 ( and UP1000)

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for that we get a platform that is quite nice for many customers, but

<EM>&gt; &gt; others are disappointed in the memory performance or capacity.

<EM>&gt;Maurice, I'm not following you here.  An LX cost around $2500 to build
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at one time.  A UP1100 should be only slightly more.  Sure any remaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;LX's are reduced now, but then so will be the UP1100 if any are left in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;1-2 years.
</EM><BR>
We used to build and sell a basic LX with RAM, HD, CDROM, floppy, video for 
<BR>
$1700
<BR>
The LX was a 533 with 2MB cache and 1GB RAM capacity, and the UX version 
<BR>
with 1.5GB capacity.
<BR>
On the LX I had SRM, UNIX options.
<BR>
And on the LX I had 64bit PCI
<BR>
This was in 1998.
<BR>
<P>Today in 2001 the similar config in a UP1100 costs $2600
<BR>
The UP1100 is a 600MHz with 768MB RAM capacity.
<BR>
On the UP1100 I have 32 bit PCI
<BR>
On the UP1100 I have Linux only.
<BR>
<P>In three years we have gained what? 66MHz and $900 cost increase..
<BR>
Taking into account 21264 versus 21164A I am sure the new one is faster.
<BR>
I hope so.. although from a memory bandwidth point of view it is not any 
<BR>
faster.
