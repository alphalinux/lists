<P>
ur not suggesting that &quot;proper code has been generated&quot; are you ?  If one
<BR>
does not know anything about the proper results, then one might think that
<BR>
the bogus answer is just as good as the right answer.
<BR>
<P>Gee, I can just imagine the frustration computational 'mad' scientists have
<BR>
with answers that go mysteriously awry.
<BR>
<P>Any way -- is it or is it not a violation of the &quot;strict aliasing&quot; . And
<BR>
how does a user know. Docs seem to be vague. Concept seems to be vague  and
<BR>
the compiler does its majic in silence.
