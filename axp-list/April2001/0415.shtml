<P>So what do you want to hear?  That the behavior of your code is defined
<BR>
according to the standard?  I don't have the relevant text handy but I'm
<BR>
pretty sure it isn't.  If you want to know how to make your code work
<BR>
as before, Brad already said -fno-strict-aliasing gives you the old
<BR>
behavior (along with lesser optimization).  FWIW I didn't realize
<BR>
-fstrict-aliasing was the default on Red Hat's compiler.  With 2.95 you
<BR>
still had to specify -fstrict-alising if you wanted it.  (Anybody
<BR>
try Uncle George's example on ccc, just for kicks?)
<BR>
<P>Anyhow... all standards and correctness issues aside, one problem with
<BR>
that sort of pointer manipulation is that the compiler cannot generate
<BR>
optimal code (i.e. eliminate evil loads/stores).  Your double argument
<BR>
starts in a register, then must be written to a temporary location from
<BR>
which the integers are read.  That's a RAW conflict, and likely causes a
<BR>
replay trap.
<BR>
<P>I don't know if EV6 has a better way, but you aren't going to see one as
<BR>
long as you are confusing the compiler by casting pointers.  A union is
<BR>
the correct way to handle it.  In principle, the compiler can optimize
<BR>
accesses to a union type by generating register-&gt;register ops when
<BR>
appropriate.  (I proved this with an experiment on x86, since my alpha is
<BR>
1000's of miles away and crippled by a power storm... &lt;sigh&gt;.)
