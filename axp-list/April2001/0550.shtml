<P>
Thanks to Uncle George for a good explanation of what's happens when
<BR>
floating-point exceptions occur; I believe I'm beginning to understand some
<BR>
of the basic issues involved in denorm handling.
<BR>
<P>The problem I'm running into is when denorms are generated within optimized
<BR>
libraries like CXML (specifically the BLAS routines).  I've tried to
<BR>
compile Kazushige Goto's BLAS codes with -fpe3 to try to eliminate these
<BR>
FPE problems, but to no avail.  (His DGEMM functions use some hand-coded
<BR>
assembler, however, so my -fpe3 flags may make no difference there.)  So,
<BR>
I'm still up against a wall.
<BR>
<P>In addition, what I still don't understand is the difference in FPE handling
<BR>
between Tru64 and Linux.  My denorm problems are not occuring under Tru64,
<BR>
even with the code compiled without the -fpe3 flag.  For those few of us
<BR>
here on the axp-list who are new to this subject, can anyone explain this?
<BR>
If knowledgeable people are looking for assistance in tracking down these
<BR>
problems, I would be more than willing to help.
<BR>
<P>Furthermore, I fear that even if I can get rid of the exceptions through
<BR>
-fpe3 or something similar, the performance hit will be so great that I'll
<BR>
have to give up Linux in favor of Tru64 after all.
<BR>

<P>&gt; FP operations are pipelined, and are at various stages of execution.  Without the
&gt; -mieee ( gcc - &quot;C&quot; compile ) switch the FPU processes instructions till a trap

&gt; occured.
&gt;
&gt; With -mieee the compiler places limits on the operations that can occure in the
&gt; pipeline, and if a limit is exceeded, the compiler will place a pause ( trapb )
&gt; instruction till the FPU has been drained &amp; ALL possible TRAPS have been processed.
&gt; So long as things are in a proper sequence, the kernel kan attempt to fix the error.
&gt; Because it know how to backtrace/backstep
&gt;
&gt; The problems I am having is with -mieee &amp; a trap &amp; not having the right number
&gt; returned as a part of the fix-up.  The numerical number will also happen with any
&gt; compiler, as it is a kernel bug
