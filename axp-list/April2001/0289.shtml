<P>
price / performance v. sun?
<BR>
<P>if you go to sunstore and look at prices:
<BR>
<P>ultra60 configuration
<BR>
(w/ 512MB RAM and 2x 450MHz/4MB CPUs) you're talking $16k
<BR>
<P>if you look at an ultra5, it's around $2800
<BR>
<P>if you look at an ultra10, it's around $4500
<BR>
<P>sun blade 1000's w/ 2 CPUs are like $20k
<BR>
<P>and sun blade 100's (the celeron equivs... due to compilers / chipset /
<BR>
latency / whatever) are around $3k for a decent config.
<BR>
<P>now you may get a slightly better / worse price from a reseller, but I'm not
<BR>
sure on this...
<BR>
<P>so the equivelent prices to get into the sun market are around the same as
<BR>
going with an equivelent alpha system.

Low-CostAlphaPlatform Suggestion
<BR>
<P><P>With regards to your message at 06:20 AM 4/11/01, Peter Petrakis. Where you 
<BR>
stated:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Reason API bailed on UP1100 is they were overpriced for what you got.
</EM><BR>
Sure
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it has a decent CPU, but NO memory bandwidth or decent capacity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It's not my place to answer this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; UP1500 looks MUCH better.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; But API did not help much as they only brought in the 600MHz and not the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 700MHz. Samsung still sells them and they are readily available.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What confuses me is the hypocrites I'm seeing on this list. The UP1000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;developers discount for a complete system cost $3000. Then the UP1100
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;came out,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;To build that up to a complete system you're looking at $2800-$3000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bucks. Now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the 1500 is comming, It's supposedly going to cost around the same as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;UP1100
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so a complete system again will cost between $2800-$3000 bucks. My
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;question is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;what stopped you 2 years ago from buying a UP1000 that has changed &quot;now&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;1500 is rolling out? It has more memory bandwidth? woohoo! Irongate 1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;had  as much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;memory bandwidth as Pyxis so it wasnt any dog. A UP1000 was still twice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as fast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as an LX in every way.
</EM><BR>
Sorry, but in making some of the comments quoted in this thread I am not 
<BR>
being a hypocrite.
<BR>
As a matter of fact I am told we bought and sold more of the UP1000 and 
<BR>
UP1100 than any other reseller in N. America. We are stills selling them.
<BR>
What I can point out, however, is the fact that the UP1100 ( and UP1000) 
<BR>
are basically 2.5 to  3 times the cost of the old LX and UX machines. And 
<BR>
for that we get a platform that is quite nice for many customers, but 
<BR>
others are disappointed in the memory performance or capacity.
<BR>
It really depends on what you want to do with it. For some applications it 
<BR>
is quite a nice machine, but for others not the best ticket.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;If you &quot;really&quot; wanted one you would have bought one already! Hell, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;went
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;broke buying my first LX in pieces 3 years ago when I was just starting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;college
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;instead of buying a car.
</EM><BR>
As a matter of fact we own 2 x UP1100 and use them in-house for software 
<BR>
testing and development. When Michal posts to this list about work he is 
<BR>
involved in on Alpha it is a UP1100 he is working on.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; What I am seeing our customers ask for  this:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;Give us a machine like the LX was in it's time. Reasonably priced,
</EM><BR>
fast,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and flexible.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It's more like &quot;I want everything for nothing and no comprimises
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;please&quot;.
</EM><BR>
Naturally!
<BR>
But realistically the cost of the UP1x00 strikes me as a bit high.
<BR>
Follow the curve of Alpha vs x86 and SPARC over the last 3 years and you 
<BR>
see the former advantages in clockspeed and price disappearing fast. Time 
<BR>
was the Alpha single CPU platforms we build enjoyed advantages in 
<BR>
clockspeed, memory bandwidth, memory capacity,  and floating point 
<BR>
performance. At a cost of around $2K to $2500 for a basic workstation.
<BR>
Now we have the floating point advantage.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; We should see that with the UP1500. Pity about the lack of UNIX but then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; this is becoming more irrelevant every day.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Exactly. Folks who want to run Tru64 are already using Tru64. Most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;users
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;couldnt care about Tru64.
</EM><BR>
Yes, but many people making buying decisions still ant the compatibility as 
<BR>
&quot;insurance&quot; in case what they are doing on Linux does not pan out. If fact 
<BR>
that is rare now, and we do have Compaq to thanks for that in making their 
<BR>
compilers and libraries available under Linux Alpha.
