<P>
Thanks, Linus. Sounds quite straitforward. My machine is XL266 for shure. I
<BR>
started with a Noname (bareboards + CPU were sold here for USD 10) but even
<BR>
with 2 Mb cache I found it rather slow. It had ARC and SRM though... The
<BR>
XL266 has only ARC and needs the MILO misery.
<BR>
<P>Are there any other options I should turn on of off?

<P><P>Hi,
<BR>
All I did was to 'install' the kernel-source from RH7.1 on my RH6.2-system, 
<BR>
and then recompile this kernel. 
<BR>
- 1st of all, you may try with the bootdisk I made. You just have to tell me
<BR>
<P>where I may upload it...
<BR>
- One of the things you gotta take care of is to turn on the option 
<BR>
CONFIG_ALPHA_LEGACY_START_ADDRESS
<BR>
if not you get the kernel in a wrong adress space (that is, for MILO).
<BR>
- Put in your machine type (is this really XL266 and not LX266?), the
<BR>
default 
<BR>
one was never stable for me.
<BR>
- Try also to get the correct .config-file from the RH7.1-distribution. I
<BR>
had 
<BR>
to add a couple of options to get it working (like loopback block-device, 
<BR>
cdrom-support, etc.) as I didn't have the original .config around.
<BR>
&nbsp;And, after all, I have to admit that I don't run a 2.4-kernel anymore. I 
<BR>
switched back to good ol' 2.2.19, as it's the only one that runs stable on
<BR>
my 
<BR>
system. Somethings not good with the PCI-driver, as I need to turn on 
<BR>
PCI-quirks. And this one seems still broken in 2.4 ( I tried 2.4.6 ). But to
<BR>
<P>install RH7.1, it was good enough. So try it and let me know if it worked
<BR>
out,
<BR>

<EM>&gt; Hi,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I happen to have an XL266 here, currrently running RH 6.2. Some time back
</EM><BR>
I
<BR>
<EM>&gt; tried to upgrade to 7.0 but all kind of weird problems showed up. As most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of you probably know the only available 'bios' for the XL266 is ARC, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; predecessor of AlphaBIOS. The problems I had ranged from floppies suddenly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not being readable to hanging system somewhere during boot.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I still would like to give it a try with 7.1, if I only could get the ISO
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; files downloaded.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linus, would the recompile you did also work for the XL266? Do you have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complete description of what I need to know in advance from the XL266 and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how I should do the (re)compile?
