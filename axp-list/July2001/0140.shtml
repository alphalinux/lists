<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Our Red Hat Linux 7.1 packages contain many fixes from Compaq.

<EM>&gt;&gt; Michal or Maurice from Harddata perhaps could share their

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Beeing called explicitely to a blackboard I can only say that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I already &quot;shared some experiences&quot; although in a private mail. :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>;o)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; I believe many improvements came forth with these patches for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Indeed this is the case although dealing with a video does not seem to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be always a hard science.  There could be a deep reason for a Voodoo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;name for graphics cards. :-) I think that above 4.0.3-15 version we did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not observe any major gotchas.  These which showed up in RH 7.1 for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Alpha are 4.0.3-21.  The problem Robert has that these versions with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;binaries compatible with libraries from RH 7.0 (which he is using and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not updating for some reasons) are hard to find.  I do not think that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they were ever officially released and &quot;rawhide&quot; tends to change quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fast in places.  Later stuff may assume that some updates were already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;made.  Mike, maybe you still have these binaries stashed somewhere?  Or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;4.0.3-21 will still work on RH 7.0?
</EM><BR>
<P>If XFree86 4.0.3 and all of the packages it depends on are
<BR>
installed on a Red Hat Linux 7.0 system, it should work fine
<BR>
minus DRI.  XFree86 4.0.2 and beyond *require* a 2.4.x kernel for
<BR>
DRI to function, and we do not have a 2.4.x kernel officially
<BR>
released for 7.0.  While 4.0.3 or later may be installed and work
<BR>
on RHL 7.0, it definitely isn't a supported thing.
<BR>
<P>If you can do without 3D accel though, it should work fine.  I
<BR>
use it on one box.  Ditto for XFree86-4.1.0.
<BR>
<P>My personal recommendation is to upgrade to 7.1 however.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I never tried.  Well, you will definitely need to update Mesa
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but this will have to be done anyway. If you do have an Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with an AGP slot then having around 'agpgart.o' module and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;allowing it to load can be a grave mistake.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, Mesa and XFree86 are married tightly.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Jay was also promissing more Alpha patches for 4.1 (hint, hint :-).
</EM><BR>
<P>If I get them soon, we can even QA/beta test them.  (more hint,
<BR>
hint...)  ;o)
<BR>
<P>4.1.0-0.9.0 is in internal rawhide, should be visible before long
<BR>
(or an even newer one).
<BR>
<P>My 4.0.3 builds are currently frozen in time.  Last release was
<BR>
4.0.3-22.5.  I plan on doing some new stuff, bumping to -23 and
<BR>
putting it in the usual place, but I don't know when that will
<BR>
occur...  I could copy over 22.5 for alpha to my sig site..
