<P>
the only thing that you'd have to be really concerned about is booting the
<BR>
kernel. Once it's booted, you can run just about anything for a controller
<BR>
that's supported under alphalinux (IDE/ SCSI/ etc).
<BR>
<P>couple of obvious (but hardly practical) choices are to:
<BR>
-put aboot and your kernel on a floppy (may not fit this way)
<BR>
-burn a CD of aboot and a kernel and boot that way.
<BR>
<P>I forget which AlphaServer it was, but one of them REQUIRED you to use a
<BR>
floppy to boot OSF/1 on it (not just for installs... EVERY time you booted
<BR>
it). 
<BR>
<P>another choice would be to get a small disk and connect it to the on-board
<BR>
QLogic card. You'd boot off that drive, and then use the disk connected to
<BR>
the 2940U2W to run the machine from. The only problem with this is that
<BR>
there isn't anywhere to put a second 3 1/2&quot; drive in the case unless you
<BR>
take the floppy or the CDRom out.

<EM>&gt;You're right, it probably doesn't support IDE either...

<EM>&gt;The old Digital Semiconductor EB boards

(CABRIO/EB66/EB164/PC164/LX164/SX164)
<BR>
<EM>&gt;were the earliest ones to support IDE; of the workstations, MIATA (DPW/PWS)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was first, IIRC. Most of the EV6-bases boxes do, specifically for IDE

CDROM.

If so, then that sure limits the choices pretty strictly!
<BR>
Even the EB boards have IDE. We have an old PCI33 board running here as a 
<BR>
firewall box, and even it has IDE..
<BR>
<P>I guess the only choice left would be an Intraserver or QLogic SCSI card
<BR>
then..
<BR>
<P>Looking over at David's Island Computer site:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.islandco.com/controller.htm">http://www.islandco.com/controller.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>I see some decent choices.
<BR>
<P>We also have the Intraserver 3140U cards in SRM supported version for $199
<BR>
<P>Good luck!
