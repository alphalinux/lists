<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2.4.3-12, which is packaged with 7.1 distribution, is in my experience

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; a total turkey (yes, I wrote about that on bugzilla quite a while ago).

<EM>&gt; &gt; Hum ho, the dirty laundry moment.....

<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I had more stable kernels to stick on the CD however, at the higher up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; management level I was told to lock step with x86/ia64 development
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which in theory means less test/retesting for the QA cycle. The VM issues
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are well known and even now in the 2.4 kernel tree, have not been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; completely squashed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What exactly are the problems you're talking of? We would like to use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 2.4.3-12 kernel for our development environment for some time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since we could not find major problems with it yet and we don't want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to switch kernels too often. We have some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ES40's and DS20's which seem to run quite stable with it.
</EM><BR>
<P>It was not me who was complaining about stability but somebody who
<BR>
opened that thread (I wrote only that I would be not surprised to learn
<BR>
about such problems) and you carefully cut the line identifying the
<BR>
author of further comments.  But I know from practice that this 2.4.3-12
<BR>
kernel goes into swap on the slightest provocation, triggers &quot;oom
<BR>
killer&quot; (i.e. any process may vanish suddenly and randomly) very easily
<BR>
and, if you will try to open a desktop, or emacs, or anything which
<BR>
requires a bit more of memory, then you wait for a very looong time
<BR>
before anything will happen and a red drive LED goes solid (normally it
<BR>
only blinks from time to time).  All of this on a machine with 256 MB of
<BR>
a physical memory and configured with over 1/2 GB of swap.  For me this
<BR>
is ridiculous and unacceptable behaviour and if you think that all 2.4
<BR>
kernels have the same characteristics then you are deeply mistaken.
<BR>
<P>As a matter of fact with all my hacking with various kernels only with
<BR>
2.4.3-12 I have seen &quot;oom killer&quot; in action and this was not a pretty
<BR>
sight.  I would be really mad to see an important and prolonged
<BR>
computation to fall prey to that.
<BR>
<P>I sort of expect that once you started some processes, and they happen
<BR>
to fit reasonably well with your available _now_ resources then things
<BR>
are running fine after a lengthy startup phase.  But anything out
<BR>
of ordinary and you may find yourself in a swap fest.
<BR>
<P>With different physical resources and/or computation patterns (which
<BR>
implies different mememory usage and so on) you may find symptoms
<BR>
described above more or less severe.  But counting on your luck seems
<BR>
to me a bit too fragile. :-)
