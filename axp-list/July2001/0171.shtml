<P>
Hello List,
<BR>
<P>I am trying to write to a tape on a remote linux
<BR>
box by using the following command:
<BR>
<P>gtar cPvf - $FILELIST | rsh -l $username \
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$remote_host /bin/buffer -o $TAPE_DEV
<BR>
<P>This works really well, reducing the amount of time
<BR>
to backup by an order of magnitude (due to the use
<BR>
of the /bin/buffer command).
<BR>
<P>The old command was:
<BR>
<P>gtar rPvf $username@$remote_host:$TAPE_DEV \
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$FILELIST
<BR>
<P>Which took way too much time (but the &quot;r&quot; did
<BR>
allow me to append to the existing data).
<BR>
<P>My problem is this:
<BR>
<P>After writing to the tape once, any subsequent
<BR>
backups will overwrite the previous (the tape
<BR>
has plenty of room for more files) since the
<BR>
buffer command does not have the ability to
<BR>
&quot;append&quot; to the tape archive. 
<BR>
<P>Is there a way to use the first command I listed
<BR>
and have it &quot;APPEND&quot; to the tape rather than over
<BR>
write it?
<BR>
<P>I have tried to use the &quot;no-rewind&quot; option, but one
<BR>
of the requirements of the script is that it rewind
<BR>
the tape and re-read what is listed to verify that
<BR>
all the files got backed up. This would be okay if
<BR>
I could find a way to position the tape at the end
<BR>
of the existing archives prior to writing to the tape,
<BR>
but I've not been able to figure out how to position
<BR>
the tape.
<BR>
<P>I've used the &quot;mt&quot; command with &quot;eod&quot;, but this didn't
<BR>
seem to prevent the overwritting of existing files.
<BR>
<P>Any suggestions would be appreciated and I will
<BR>
summarize.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
Robert
