<P><EM>&gt; Do you know where I could look for information on this problem. Are there 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mailinglist / newsgroup which will announce a fix for this problem. I

<EM>&gt; searched various mail archives (especially linux-kernel archive) and also at 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; google groups but didn't find (helpfull) futher info.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe you can point to places to look for updates anouncments of this...
</EM><BR>
<P>Basically, just watch new kernel release announcements (the changelogs
<BR>
may have a note about it).  The 2.4.7 release supposedly has fixed this
<BR>
problem on some Alpha systypes, but not all yet.  Those changes may
<BR>
provide a good idea of what is going on in our cases.  Looks like quite a
<BR>
few Alpha systypes were affected by this problem though (SX, LX, a few
<BR>
others as well), fyi.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; When did this problem occure in the kernel.
</EM><BR>
<P>IIRC, it was 2.2.18 that started this.  2.4 kernels have always done this
<BR>
to me (since 2.4.0test-something).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Because I used SuSE 6.4 with a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.2.x kernel (the version that came with SuSE). IIRC I saw this reboot 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem on AS200 machines with SuSE 6.1 too (ealry 2.2.x kernel).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; While I was searching the mail archive I came across a post which said, that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux modifys some structure which it hands back to SRM and that the problem 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is there (this would mean a problem in some of the asm files of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kernel...).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But why does it work with some kernels and not with some others??
</EM><BR>
<P>That sounds about right.  There are certain things that the kernel tries
<BR>
to pass back to SRM, so it needs to modify some registers to do so.  Some
<BR>
SRMs don't support some of the features that it tries to pass back (like
<BR>
power-off, etc), so those cases may cause a weird error or it may just not
<BR>
affect SRM at all.  Either way, what the kernel passes back SHOULD be
<BR>
valid and apparently isn't in our cases.  I'm doing some kernel work on
<BR>
2.2.19+ and 2.4.x, so maybe I'll force the problem to occur at home and
<BR>
decode the info it's giving me (I usually just ignore it, personally,
<BR>
since I don't shutdown that often at all).
<BR>
<P>Out of curiosity, does your system do a 'shutdown -r' correctly
<BR>
(reboot)?  From what I've seen, reboot works on my machine, but halt
<BR>
barfs.
