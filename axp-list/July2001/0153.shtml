<EM>&gt; I have an old Multia that I have run RH 5.2 on for 3 or 4 years.  I used
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to boot with ARC.  My firmware is 3.8-3 if I remember right.  My 340MB
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; internal SCSI drive died along time ago.  My floppy died a couple years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ago.  But they weren't used much.  It has 80MB of RAM.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I decided to install 7.1 and found that the smart/supported way to do it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was with SRM.  (my first experience with SRM... it's alot cooler than ARC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in my opinion)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; PROBLEM:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm booting off a SCSI CD (boot dka1).  It has a little trouble
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with SCSI resets but manages to get aboot going and then bootstraps the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux kernel.  The X install won't work.  I get an error in /tmp/X.log
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't remember what it is exactly.
</EM><BR>
<P>Same as all the others get with TGA console: the latest 4.0.3 TGA
<BR>
server requires a &quot;BusID&quot; option in the XF86Config-4 file, and RH's
<BR>
installer doesn't put one there... :-\
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Anyway, I rather do the text mode
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; install. In text mode I answer the standard questions.  I let it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; automatically format a wiped disk.  I get to the point that it wants to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; set the root user password.  After I type one in and hit enter, then it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (anaconda?) hangs!  I can still switch VCs and type in the bash prompt,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but the install has just stopped.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My md5sums are ok and I've burned several Disc 1s just to make sure it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wasn't a bad CD. Has anyone installed successfully with text mode?  I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a feeling that if I could get into X, that install would be more debugged.
</EM><BR>
<P>The hang is evidence of a problem that afflicts JENSEN SRM as well as
<BR>
UDBs running SRM: a bug that prevents correct handling of fault
<BR>
processing of an unsupported (by EV4 CPU) floating point instruction.
<BR>
<P>There have been various patches available on the net to solve this,
<BR>
but unfortunately a comprehensive solution has not become part of the
<BR>
official kernel sources (yet).
<BR>
<P>I have some patches which I will be submitting to 2.2.20 and 2.4.7;
<BR>
if you want a copy, please Email me directly.
<BR>
<P>Once equippped with those patches, you'll need to build an appropriate
<BR>
kernel for booting from floppy, and then use the RAMdisk/CD normal
<BR>
install technique, which I think should work.
