<P>
I grabbed e2fsprogs 1.22.  It compiled, tested and installed fine. I can
<BR>
fsck my filesystems and they check out fine.
<BR>
<P>This is the error that I get when I attempt to install packages:
<BR>
<P>&quot;One or more of you filesystems for your Linux system was not unmounted
<BR>
cleanly.  Please boot your linux installation, let your filesystems be
<BR>
checked, and shutdown cleanly to upgrade.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I attached the syslog from the install boot.  There seems to be some
<BR>
problem with the CD and its fs.  I cannot boot from the CD (it returns a
<BR>
crc error on the zipped kernel).  This is the second disc I have burned
<BR>
and the second time I have downloaded the image.
<BR>
<P>Ideas?  I could use some help.  I am a little stuck.  Any more suggestions
<BR>
are appreciated.  Thanks for Michal's.  It has gotten me this far.
<BR>
<P>TIA!
<BR>

<EM>&gt; &gt; I am attempting to upgrade a RH6.2 install to a RH7.1.  However, It keeps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; telling me that / needs to be fscked.  I went to the shell, to see if I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; can fsck it and none of my 6.2 paritions work with this version of fsck.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hm, on my test box I do have a mixture of partitions created and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; formatted in different times and, for a bigger attraction, also some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disks with BSD labels and some, yet, with FAT-style partition tables.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Moreover I have boot either something which started as RH 6.2 and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; another installation which is basically 7.1 (the latest, admittedly, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; latest pre-release cut but it should not really differ from what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eventually showed up on servers).  Both installations mount and fsck
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; partitions from another one and I still would have to see something like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what you describe.  Some of file systems on these partitition were layed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out probably in 5.x times and maybe even earlier.  My e2fsprogs from 7.1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (this package includes fsck) identify itself as 1.19-5.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Yet, my system boots, works, and fscks fine under RH6.2.  Does anyone know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; what this would be happening?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unless somebody seriously broke something in the last minute, which you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should promptly report on bugzilla, then no.  Do you have any error
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; messages?  Especially when running in a verbose mode?  Besides e2fsprogs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a number utilities which can provide an information how details
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of a filesystem are seen.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm not ready to wipe and start fresh.  Is there a way around this?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would compile myself a sane version of e2fsprogs if the one you have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is broken.  This HAS to work or something extremely bogus happened.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Old kernels may not support some newer features of ext2, so you have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make sure that a file system is not using these if it can be used in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such situation, but otherwise various ext2 versions, and their tools,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are backwards compatible.
