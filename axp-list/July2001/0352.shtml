<P>
The following message is a courtesy copy of an article
<BR>
that has been posted to comp.os.linux.alpha as well.
<BR>
<P>I have been running DU/Tru64 for many years on an Alpha Station
<BR>
255/300.  Wanting to change to Linux (of course!), I bought a second
<BR>
hard drive (/dev/sdb) onto which I have done an initial install using
<BR>
Alpha JumpStart! (v1.4.1). Digital Unix (v4.0D) still resides (and is
<BR>
usable) on the original smaller, hard disk (/dev/sda).
<BR>
<P>Doing some initial testing (before the mandatory second install ;-)),
<BR>
I have noticed *much* slower performance than either DU or other Intel
<BR>
Linux boxes.  As an example, when 'fsck' ran during the initial boot,
<BR>
it showed the &quot;progress bar&quot; as usual.  However, even though the disk
<BR>
is only ~35% used, the disk checking -- unlike other systems I'm using
<BR>
-- continued at the same rate over the entire drive.  In my
<BR>
experience, 'fsck' runs slower at first, then moves rapidly over the
<BR>
empty portions of the drive.
<BR>
<P>Another thing that seems odd is the length of time for 'updatedb' to
<BR>
run. It takes forever!  Starting up applications also seems to take
<BR>
longer than I'd expect on a 64-bit, 300MHz machine.
<BR>
<P>During the AJS! phase, I selected the 'ev45' kernel.  It was the
<BR>
choice highlighted, so I went ahead and used it even though I'm not
<BR>
sure the 255/300, in fact, corresponds to 'ev45'.
<BR>
<P>Another factor that might be relevant is RAM.  The machine currently
<BR>
has 192MB of RAM.  Also, I am using a Permedia2 video board with 8MB
<BR>
of memory (should I use the &quot;Permedia generic&quot; option during X
<BR>
configuration?).
<BR>
<P>I would be interested in anyone's comments about my observations.  I
<BR>
plan to do a second install this afternoon, so please let me know if
<BR>
there is something I should do differently.
<BR>
<P>Maybe I am wrong assuming that AlphaLinux will be faster -- or at
<BR>
least as fast -- as DU/Tru64.  I hope not!
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;-Kenneth
