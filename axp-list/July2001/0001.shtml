<P>
With regards to your message at 03:32 AM 7/5/01, Mike Tibor. Where you stated:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;In my experience you just can't compare power supplies by their respective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rated wattages.
</EM><BR>
<P>You just mentioned the REAL point above: &quot;rated wattages&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;For example, the PC Power &amp; Cooling Turbo-Cool 300 ATX puts out the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;amps as a Leadman Powmax LP-6100D 400 watt power supply (listed on AMD's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Athlon approved list) on the following lines:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;+5v
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;+3.3v
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;-5v
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The LP-6100D does better on +12v (16A vs 12A on the PC P&amp;C), but the PC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;P&amp;C 300w ps does better on -12v (1A vs 0.5A on the LP-6100D).
</EM><BR>
<P>Frankly all of that is irrelevant.
<BR>
What is needed mainly for CPU is the +3.3V power.
<BR>
For the motherboard chipset, and most importantly for PCI is the 5V.
<BR>
For storage devices you need +12V for the motors, which are basically the 
<BR>
only part of the computer that uses +12V.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Possibly more important is the regulation characteristics of the power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;supplies.  The PC P&amp;C power supply has the best regulation characteristics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I've ever seen, bar none.
</EM><BR>
<P>They are a well made line of supplies.
<BR>
We also find good results with Zippy, NMB, and Delta. Almost everything 
<BR>
else we have seen and tested has been basically cheap junk. We are very 
<BR>
sensitive to this, as power supply failure is the #3 point of failure under 
<BR>
warranty, after hard disks and CDROMs
<BR>
Regulation is definitely an important part. See below for some further 
<BR>
comment on this aspect.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;For example, the following is the rated power regulation of an Enermax
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;EG365P-VE FC 350 watt power supply:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is not to say that the PC Power &amp; Cooling power supplies are the best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;available; rather, the PC P&amp;C as well as the Leadman and Enermax power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;supplies were the only units I had data available to me in my computer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;room at home at 11pm as I type this.  :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>When the 21264 CPUs came out we saw the ratings for power supplies 
<BR>
published back then, mainly from the DEC and API people, and were curious 
<BR>
as to exactly what the breakdown was, and why.
<BR>
We brought in and tested a number of supplies then and afterwards.
<BR>
What we found out was enlightening.
<BR>
We have a test rig we use, that is essentially a static load device.
<BR>
A big bus bar, with a large row of extremely heavy duty ceramic, coil-wound 
<BR>
resistors.
<BR>
On the end is a big variable resistor pot.
<BR>
We hook up an amp meter probe that wraps around the output cords from the 
<BR>
supply to measure the current levels. This has to be measured separately 
<BR>
for 3.3, 5 and 12V.
<BR>
To test a supply we hook up a fixed load on the 12V side, using 6 hard 
<BR>
disks (SCSI, 10,000rpm) assuming that is the max that a machine would have 
<BR>
in it.
<BR>
We then load up the 5V at 2/3 of rated maximum and gradually increase the 
<BR>
3.3V loading.
<BR>
We start at 50% of rated 3.3V max and go up from there until we see:
<BR>
Voltage level dropping 10% from 3.3V OR: wires getting too hot to touch and 
<BR>
smelling like burning, OR: Internal components on the supply, such as heat 
<BR>
sinks and capacitors starting to get too hot and making a bad smell.
<BR>
We then back off about 10% and run it under load for about 12 hours, and 
<BR>
then remeasure. This is to allow for everything to temperature stabilize or 
<BR>
fail.
<BR>
<P>We found that the typical Zippy supply would run at about 20% more than 
<BR>
rated output happily, and never shut down above that, until we pushed it to 
<BR>
the point that the output wires got too hot.
<BR>
Similar results for the big Delta and NMB supplies.
<BR>
Sparkle would do at least rated power within 10% tolerances, and Chenbro 
<BR>
would too.
<BR>
Enermax was interesting.
<BR>
They have a unit that is advertised as a 515W supply.
<BR>
When you look at the firn print on the label it says &quot;515W peak power&quot;
<BR>
And when you add up the V x amps on each of the output levels it adds up to 
<BR>
about 435W.
<BR>
According to their label and literature the 3.3V is rated to 32A.
<BR>
When we tested it the 3.3V fell out of the 10% tolerance at 23A, and at 27A 
<BR>
the power supply shut down!
<BR>
we have not done much with the PC Power units, as they strictly sell these 
<BR>
retail and give no discounts. Further the larger sized ones over 400W have 
<BR>
a funny large size, and do not fit in many cases very well.. We have the 
<BR>
same size problem with the bigger Delta units, so we do not use those much 
<BR>
either.
<BR>
Interestingly also, is the so-called &quot;600W&quot; unit in the API &quot;PowerRac&quot; has 
<BR>
no cooling vents or fans, but out of the case fails at 540W and in the 
<BR>
closed case only holds up for 12 hours at 470W!
<BR>
<P>Frankly, we get better output from a Zippy &quot;400W&quot; rated unit.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;I should point out that when I built my home server using a PC164
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;motherboard and the above mentioned Leadman Powmax LP-6100D 400w power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;supply, the motherboard died shortly thereafter with a fried voltage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;regulator.  While I have no irrefutable evidence that the power supply was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the cause, I have made the decision to only use PC Power &amp; Cooling power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;supplies (or those with equivalent regulation/ripple characteristics) in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;future Alpha systems.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sound reasoning. I concur with you.
<BR>
A lot of &quot;funny&quot; problems that happen on computers can be traced back to 
<BR>
marginal power supplies.
<BR>
We had a customer 2 weeks ago buy an ASUS AMD DDR motherboard and a 1.4GHz 
<BR>
athlon and some DDR memory from us. He supplied his existing case and power.
<BR>
We put a big high-end CPU cooler on it too.
<BR>
HE called to complain that the unit was overheating and shutting down.
<BR>
We changed the CPU, cooler, and motherboard to no avail.
<BR>
Finally one of our techs put in a new Zippy supply.
<BR>
<P>Voila! Problem is gone away!
<BR>
<P>Ta for now amigo!
