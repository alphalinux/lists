<P>
I have an  PC164SX  (I think that is SX164).
<BR>
I have never been able to get anything but the
<BR>
milo for SX164 that came with RH 5.X to work.
<BR>
I think that is now biting me on my hindquarters.
<BR>
<P>When I boot RH 7.1 installation from the floppy
<BR>
image using the arc console and milo it loads
<BR>
the compressed image on the floppy and then
<BR>
hangs after it says it is starting the kernel.  With
<BR>
all of the problems people have had with SRM,
<BR>
I just chose not to make the move.  I would like to
<BR>
resolve the difficulty with later milo images:
<BR>
how to get a newer one to compile without
<BR>
a million error messages,  and:  how to 
<BR>
get RH 7.1 installation from diskette boot/
<BR>
CD-ROM  not to hang.  I have EIDE drive,
<BR>
cabled to the board (Maxtor),  an ATI
<BR>
Mach 64 PCI card,  and SB AWE64 sound card,
<BR>
and a tulip driver ethernet card in it.  There is
<BR>
nothing strange in this machine.  The machine
<BR>
is currently running 2.2.19-7.0.8 and RH 7.0
<BR>
without difficulty.
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
Bob McGwier
