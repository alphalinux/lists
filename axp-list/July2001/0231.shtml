<EM>&gt; The code looks to be under GPL v2.  I don't know why it isn't integrated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into the kernel.
</EM><BR>
<P>The most likely reason in that case is that nobody ever bothered to
<BR>
submit it.  The driver should also have a maintainer/owner.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It doesn't require any patches to the rest of the kernel.
</EM><BR>
<P>Drivers of that sort which really affect only users of a particular
<BR>
piece of hardware are accepted all the time even in &quot;stable&quot; series of
<BR>
kernels.  But nobody is actively seeking &quot;what else can we add here&quot; so
<BR>
somebody with an itch has to show some initiative. :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As far as getting my patch back to Qlogic, I probably have been too lazy.
</EM><BR>
<P>A driver which works only on one architecture will likely be rejected
<BR>
in that form right away.  It is a maintaner job to assure that a given
<BR>
driver has at least a fighting chance everywhere.  There are also
<BR>
matters of conforming to a style, documentation, keeping global
<BR>
variables from colliding with anything else and other housekeeping
<BR>
chores of that sort.  It does not mean that s/he has to do all that work
<BR>
but this will be a clearing and a coordination point for all eventual
<BR>
patches.
<BR>
<P>There are some old drivers without a real maintainer.  As long as they
<BR>
are &quot;quiet&quot; and do not create troubles then fine.  From time to time
<BR>
somebody has to clean them up a bit and some actually go broken for
<BR>
quite prolonged periods.  If nobody gets hands dirty that means that
<BR>
nobody cares.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I should probably do it anyway.
</EM><BR>
<P>Pretty good way to get your name on MAINTAINERS list. :-)
