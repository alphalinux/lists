Hello List!
<BR>
<P>Thank you to all who responded to my plea:
<BR>
<P>Wes
<BR>
Tim
<BR>
Alvin
<BR>
Michal
<BR>
<P>You've been a great resource in a time of need.
<BR>
<P>Wes had a good suggestion. I tried &quot;-b&quot; before
<BR>
moving to the new command and had optimized it,
<BR>
but using the &quot;buffer&quot; command improved things
<BR>
so dramatically that I'm trying to avoid the
<BR>
old command. But thank you for the reality check.
<BR>
<P>Alvin gave me some info about tape layout that I did
<BR>
not know and I will find it very useful in trying to
<BR>
incorporate the solutions suggested.
<BR>
<P>Michal and Tim and Alvin all pointed to the need
<BR>
to use the non-rewinding device, which I had tried.
<BR>
I will be re-visiting the use of the nst0 device
<BR>
in the hopes that my earlier attempts at using it
<BR>
as a solution were somehow flawed (a new day, a
<BR>
new perspective).
<BR>
<P>Following are the responses I've received so far.
<BR>
If more come in today, I'll try to send an additional
<BR>
summary later.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
Robert
<BR>
(not the REAL John Doe)
<BR>
<P>Summary:
<BR>
<P>----------------------------------
<BR>
Wes:
<BR>
<P>Try adding '-b 128' to your old command and see if
<BR>
that speeds it up a bit. Experiment with various
<BR>
values to
<BR>
see what your drive will allow and which performs
<BR>
best.
<BR>
Then you get your original append function back.
<BR>
<P>----------------------------------
<BR>
Tim:
<BR>
<P>Whats the value of $TAPE_DEV ?
<BR>
<P>You should set it to the non-rewinding form ie:
<BR>
/dev/rmt/0lbn
<BR>
<P>This will leave you positioned at the end of the file
<BR>
once backup is
<BR>
complete. You can continue to add file sets/tars/dumps
<BR>
etc until you
<BR>
run out of tape.  &quot;mt status&quot; will report the position
<BR>
&nbsp;you are
<BR>
currently on and the file you are current at the end
<BR>
off or in.
<BR>
<P>----------------------------------
<BR>
Alvin:
<BR>
<P>first you will need to use a nonrewind device like
<BR>
/dev/nst0. Otherwise
<BR>
every time a program closes the file there will be a
<BR>
rewind done.
<BR>
<P>One simple solution is to just use a norewind device
<BR>
and just do a
<BR>
sequence of tars with each one appending after the
<BR>
other.
<BR>
<P>The other possiblity  is to use mt to forward space to
<BR>
the next file
<BR>
mark.
<BR>
<P>Generaly a tape is layed out like this
<BR>
<P>SOT(start of tape)
<BR>
data
<BR>
FM(file mark)
<BR>
data
<BR>
FM(file mark)
<BR>
...
<BR>
FM
<BR>
data
<BR>
FM
<BR>
FM
<BR>
EOT
<BR>
<P>the 2 file marks in a row are concidered the end of
<BR>
data on the tape
<BR>
and
<BR>
the EOT is the physical end of tape.
<BR>
<P>It has been a while and this is only a general
<BR>
direction. You will have
<BR>
to play a lot go get this working just right.
<BR>
<P>streaming tapes usualy will only let you append to the
<BR>
tape at the
<BR>
point
<BR>
where you will find the two FMs in a row. Some will
<BR>
not even let you do
<BR>
that.
<BR>
<P>you should be able to read a file(data) from the tape
<BR>
and then forward
<BR>
space over the file mark and then read the next
<BR>
file(data) and so on
<BR>
till you get a data read with 0 data. This means you
<BR>
have now found the
<BR>
2 file marks in a row. You should be able to start
<BR>
writing from this
<BR>
point.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;&gt;From the man page on mt you should be able to do
</EM><BR>
somthing like:
<BR>
mt -f /dev/nst0 eod
<BR>
tar cf /dev/nst0 /blah/blah
<BR>
mt -f /dev/nst0 rewind
<BR>
<P>But I have not tried this one in practice.
<BR>
<P>----------------------------------
<BR>
Michal:
<BR>
<P>Write on a non-rewinding device an manipulate your
<BR>
tape
<BR>
explictily with 'mt' (positioning, writing marks,
<BR>
rewinding).
<BR>
You will get a bunch of separate archives but, once
<BR>
again,
<BR>
use mt on a non-rewinding tape device before recovery.
<BR>
<P>----------------------------------
<BR>
<P><P><P>Initial request:
<BR>
==========================
<BR>
Hello List,
<BR>
<P>I am trying to write to a tape on a remote linux
<BR>
box by using the following command:
<BR>
<P>gtar cPvf - $FILELIST | rsh -l $username \
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$remote_host /bin/buffer -o $TAPE_DEV
<BR>
<P>This works really well, reducing the amount of time
<BR>
to backup by an order of magnitude (due to the use
<BR>
of the /bin/buffer command).
<BR>
<P>The old command was:
<BR>
<P>gtar rPvf $username@$remote_host:$TAPE_DEV \
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$FILELIST
<BR>
<P>Which took way too much time (but the &quot;r&quot; did
<BR>
allow me to append to the existing data).
<BR>
<P>My problem is this:
<BR>
<P>After writing to the tape once, any subsequent
<BR>
backups will overwrite the previous (the tape
<BR>
has plenty of room for more files) since the
<BR>
buffer command does not have the ability to
<BR>
&quot;append&quot; to the tape archive. 
<BR>
<P>Is there a way to use the first command I listed
<BR>
and have it &quot;APPEND&quot; to the tape rather than over
<BR>
write it?
<BR>
<P>I have tried to use the &quot;no-rewind&quot; option, but one
<BR>
of the requirements of the script is that it rewind
<BR>
the tape and re-read what is listed to verify that
<BR>
all the files got backed up. This would be okay if
<BR>
I could find a way to position the tape at the end
<BR>
of the existing archives prior to writing to the tape,
<BR>
but I've not been able to figure out how to position
<BR>
the tape.
<BR>
<P>I've used the &quot;mt&quot; command with &quot;eod&quot;, but this didn't
<BR>
seem to prevent the overwritting of existing files.
<BR>
<P>Any suggestions would be appreciated and I will
<BR>
summarize.
