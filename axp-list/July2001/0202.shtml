<P>
I'm having a strange problem with a PC164LX machine and RedHat 7.1.
<BR>
<P>This machine was running 7.0 using SRM without any problems.  I merged
<BR>
the contents of the two 7.1 install CDs, applied the latest updates, re-ran
<BR>
genhdlist, then did booted from floppy and did an NFS install of 7.1.
<BR>
<P>The install completed without any problems, but when I attempt to boot
<BR>
the system from the scsi disk it looks ok until I get:
<BR>
<P>aboot: booting from device 'SCSI 0 5 0 0 0 0 0'
<BR>
*** no timer interrupts on CPU 0 ***
<BR>
aboot: valid disklabel found: 4 partitions.

<P>This repeats for a while then I get:

<BR>
Welcome to aboot 0.7
<BR>
Commands:
<BR>
<P>I can use &quot;l&quot; to list aboot.conf without problems and &quot;d boot&quot; shows the
<BR>
kernels, etc, I just can't get it to boot.
<BR>
<P>I've tried restarting the install until I can run fdisk, then switching to
<BR>
another console, mounting the new / and running swriteboot, but it doesn't
<BR>
help.
<BR>
<P>I also tried overwriting the first few blocks of the disk and reinstalling,
<BR>
parititioning the disk by hand using fdisk (making sure not to use cylinder
<BR>
1), but I get the same results.
<BR>
<P>Any ideas what's going on?  About all I can think to do at this point is to
<BR>
install from the two original 7.1 CDs, but frankly I don't see how that will
<BR>
make any difference.
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
<P>Jim
