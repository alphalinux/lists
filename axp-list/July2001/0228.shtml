<EM>&gt; &gt; Hi Andrei, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Thanks for the information.  I guess that it was not QLOGIC that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; developed the QL2XXX drivers for Alpha Linux?  It's good to know that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the support is built in.  Now I have to figure out how to get funding 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for the new FCAL cards. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Qlogic did not develop the driver that is in the kernel.  However, there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a driver from Qlogic that works with Linux.  However, &quot;Linux&quot; in this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sense means i386.  However, you can get the driver to work under Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The problem 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the Qlogic driver is that it assumes that sizeof(dma_addr_t) ==
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BITS_PER_LONG. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On the Alpha, this is not the case. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If someone wants the patch I can send it out.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Humm sounds like something tbat should be useful in the kernel. Was this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; patch never accepted upstream? or am I going to horrified to find out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's not GPL code that we can merge with the kernel? 
</EM><BR>
<P>The code looks to be under GPL v2.  I don't know why it isn't integrated
<BR>
into the kernel.  It doesn't require any patches to the rest of the kernel.
<BR>
I guess it would take someone to actually do that.
<BR>
<P>As far as getting my patch back to Qlogic, I probably have been too lazy.
<BR>
At one point I talked to one of the engineers who was doing the development.
<BR>
We had a pretty good relationship and I got him to make a few portability
<BR>
changes.  He left the company and I was told it was best to go though
<BR>
the general support email to talk to the developers.  I got lazy at that
<BR>
point and never sent the changes to them.  
<BR>
<P>I should probably do it anyway.  I will put it on my list of things to do.
<BR>
The problem is that the developers will have to change how they do things
<BR>
to remember that the world is more than ia32 and ia64.
