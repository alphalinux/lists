</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kernel goes into swap on the slightest provocation, triggers &quot;oom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; killer&quot; (i.e. any process may vanish suddenly and randomly) very easily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and, if you will try to open a desktop, or emacs, or anything which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; requires a bit more of memory, then you wait for a very looong time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before anything will happen and a red drive LED goes solid (normally it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only blinks from time to time).  All of this on a machine with 256 MB of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a physical memory and configured with over 1/2 GB of swap.  For me this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is ridiculous and unacceptable behaviour and if you think that all 2.4
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kernels have the same characteristics then you are deeply mistaken.
</EM><BR>
<P>I noticed that 2.4.3 was _dog_ _awful_ here when I ran a simple
<BR>
stress-tester against it.
<BR>
<P>You may want to try to set overcommit_memory to 1 and see if that helps.
<BR>
<P>Or, you might want to roll your own with a 2.4.4 kernel, or experiment
<BR>
freely with the 2.4.6-acX series of kernels. 2.4.5 had a bug in VFS, if I
<BR>
recall correctly, and 2.4.6 seems to have a few issues with memory
<BR>
reporting.
<BR>
<P>Of course, I'm not entirely sure as to how 2.4.4 works on alphas, so YMMV.
