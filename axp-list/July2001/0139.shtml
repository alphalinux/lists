<EM>&gt; Our Red Hat Linux 7.1 packages contain many fixes from Compaq.

<EM>&gt; Michal or Maurice from Harddata perhaps could share their

<EM>&gt; experiences with the new release?
</EM><BR>
<P>Beeing called explicitely to a blackboard I can only say that
<BR>
I already &quot;shared some experiences&quot; although in a private mail. :-)
<BR>
<P>Althought most of our experiences comes from running 4.0.3 (various
<BR>
cards) with a server recompiled by yours truly with libraries
<BR>
from RH 6.2 I do not think that the later is a significant factor.
<BR>
I do have also RH 7.1 running but a range of tried cards is smaller.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I believe many improvements came forth with these patches for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<P>Indeed this is the case although dealing with a video does not seem to
<BR>
be always a hard science.  There could be a deep reason for a Voodoo
<BR>
name for graphics cards. :-) I think that above 4.0.3-15 version we did
<BR>
not observe any major gotchas.  These which showed up in RH 7.1 for
<BR>
Alpha are 4.0.3-21.  The problem Robert has that these versions with
<BR>
binaries compatible with libraries from RH 7.0 (which he is using and
<BR>
not updating for some reasons) are hard to find.  I do not think that
<BR>
they were ever officially released and &quot;rawhide&quot; tends to change quite
<BR>
fast in places.  Later stuff may assume that some updates were already
<BR>
made.  Mike, maybe you still have these binaries stashed somewhere?  Or
<BR>
4.0.3-21 will still work on RH 7.0?  I never tried.  Well, you will
<BR>
definitely need to update Mesa but this will have to be done anyway.
<BR>
If you do have an Alpha with an AGP slot then having around 'agpgart.o'
<BR>
module and allowing it to load can be a grave mistake.
<BR>
<P>Jay was also promissing more Alpha patches for 4.1 (hint, hint :-).
