<EM>&gt; Hi Andrei,

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks for the information.  I guess that it was not QLOGIC that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; developed the QL2XXX drivers for Alpha Linux?  It's good to know that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the support is built in.  Now I have to figure out how to get funding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the new FCAL cards.
</EM><BR>
<P>Qlogic did not develop the driver that is in the kernel.  However, there
<BR>
is a driver from Qlogic that works with Linux.  However, &quot;Linux&quot; in this
<BR>
sense means i386.  However, you can get the driver to work under Alpha.  The problem
<BR>
with the Qlogic driver is that it assumes that sizeof(dma_addr_t) == BITS_PER_LONG.
<BR>
On the Alpha, this is not the case.
<BR>
<P>If someone wants the patch I can send it out.
<BR>
<P>I am running the Qlogic-4.27beta driver on an XP1000 quite successfully right
<BR>
now.  It has been running for the last 6 weeks in production without problems.
<BR>
I am exporting the filesystem over NFS, so I am not always pushing the filesystem
<BR>
as hard as if it were local.  With NFS and gigabit Ethernet I am seeing 45 MB/s for
<BR>
writes and reads (Local performance on writes saturates the FC card).  I never 
<BR>
had too much luck with the driver in the kernel.  The last one I tried was the one in 
<BR>
linux-2.4.3.  Maybe it just didn't like something it saw from my SAN (Data Direct).
