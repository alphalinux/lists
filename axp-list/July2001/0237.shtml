<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Andrei,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the information.  I guess that it was not QLOGIC that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; developed the QL2XXX drivers for Alpha Linux?  It's good to know that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the support is built in.  Now I have to figure out how to get funding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; for the new FCAL cards.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Qlogic did not develop the driver that is in the kernel.  However, there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is a driver from Qlogic that works with Linux.  However, &quot;Linux&quot; in this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sense means i386.  However, you can get the driver to work under Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with the Qlogic driver is that it assumes that sizeof(dma_addr_t) ==
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; BITS_PER_LONG.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; On the Alpha, this is not the case.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If someone wants the patch I can send it out.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Humm sounds like something tbat should be useful in the kernel. Was this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; patch never accepted upstream? or am I going to horrified to find out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it's not GPL code that we can merge with the kernel?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The code looks to be under GPL v2.  I don't know why it isn't integrated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into the kernel.  It doesn't require any patches to the rest of the kernel.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I guess it would take someone to actually do that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As far as getting my patch back to Qlogic, I probably have been too lazy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; At one point I talked to one of the engineers who was doing the development.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We had a pretty good relationship and I got him to make a few portability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changes.  He left the company and I was told it was best to go though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the general support email to talk to the developers.  I got lazy at that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point and never sent the changes to them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I should probably do it anyway.  I will put it on my list of things to do.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The problem is that the developers will have to change how they do things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to remember that the world is more than ia32 and ia64.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<P>Ok, I'll stick my hand up for the driver/changes then 8)
