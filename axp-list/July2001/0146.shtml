<P>
I have an old Multia that I have run RH 5.2 on for 3 or 4 years.  I used
<BR>
to boot with ARC.  My firmware is 3.8-3 if I remember right.  My 340MB
<BR>
internal SCSI drive died along time ago.  My floppy died a couple years
<BR>
ago.  But they weren't used much.  It has 80MB of RAM.
<BR>
<P>I decided to install 7.1 and found that the smart/supported way to do it
<BR>
was with SRM.  (my first experience with SRM... it's alot cooler than ARC
<BR>
in my opinion)
<BR>
<P>PROBLEM:
<BR>
I'm booting off a SCSI CD (boot dka1).  It has a little trouble
<BR>
with SCSI resets but manages to get aboot going and then bootstraps the
<BR>
Linux kernel.  The X install won't work.  I get an error in /tmp/X.log
<BR>
can't remember what it is exactly.  Anyway, I rather do the text mode
<BR>
install. In text mode I answer the standard questions.  I let it
<BR>
automatically format a wiped disk.  I get to the point that it wants to
<BR>
set the root user password.  After I type one in and hit enter, then it
<BR>
(anaconda?) hangs!  I can still switch VCs and type in the bash prompt,
<BR>
but the install has just stopped.
<BR>
<P>My md5sums are ok and I've burned several Disc 1s just to make sure it
<BR>
wasn't a bad CD. Has anyone installed successfully with text mode?  I have
<BR>
a feeling that if I could get into X, that install would be more debugged.
<BR>
<P>Can someone help me?
<BR>
Thanks, Scott Serr
