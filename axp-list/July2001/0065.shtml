<EM>&gt; &gt; I noticed that 2.4.3 was _dog_ _awful_ here when I ran a simple

<EM>&gt; &gt; stress-tester against it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not surprised.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You may want to try to set overcommit_memory to 1 and see if that helps.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is not likely to change very much.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 2.4.5 had a bug in VFS, if I recall correctly,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Indeed.  Unpatched 2.4.5 will not even compile on Alpha.  But all of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this was corrected quite fast in &quot;ac&quot; series.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and 2.4.6 seems to have a few issues with memory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reporting.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Reporting is not that crucial.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Of course, I'm not entirely sure as to how 2.4.4 works on alphas, so YMMV.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you will have one which works it actually works pretty well;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; especially if you have SMP.  But you will have to be pretty careful,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; read quite a few release notes, and test on your setup.  VM is still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shaky but it is visibly improving.  There are known issues.

<P>Actually one of the more annoying and serious issues I'd like to get fixed is
<BR>
what I believe to be a shared interrupt problem on the Tsunami chipset boards.
<BR>
Being the el cheapo person I am by circumstance, lemme give you two examples.
<BR>
<P>Example 1:
<BR>
<P>Adding a Promise (20267) dual channel ATA100 card. Reason? to provide a cheap
<BR>
SW raid0 device using two 80Gb drives. The problem here is that in an effort to
<BR>
increase speed, the drives are housed one per channel. A quick look at
<BR>
/proc/interrupts shows that ide2, ide3 both share the same interrupt being on
<BR>
the same card in the same PCI slot, nothing out of the ordinary there.
<BR>
Unfortunately, the kernel will hard lock if the IO to the disks subsystem gets
<BR>
too 'frisky' and you have to reset the box,.. which in turn goes off to fsck
<BR>
the raid device which creates massive IO across the two drives for a few
<BR>
seconds before, again, going into a hard lock. The same setup works *perfectly*
<BR>
on a sx164 box. I'm guessing that theres some chipset magic or PCI misbehaviour
<BR>
on the Tsunami board that the kernel either causes or is unware of.
<BR>
<P>Example 2:
<BR>
<P>Again, Tsunami chipset (UP2000, XP1000 etc... ) Using one ethernet card is
<BR>
fantastic, you can drive the network wire until it glows in the dark
<BR>
(exageration), however, if you add in a second network card in an ADJASENT PCI
<BR>
slot the machine will again hard lock. Bizzarely, shifting the network card
<BR>
around in the machine to a non adjasent slot will cure the problem though it
<BR>
feels very hackish. I believe that what might be happeneing here is that
<BR>
certain PCI slots are being addressed as the same interuppt number and again
<BR>
I'm hitting something akin to the shared interrupt proble I think exists (can't
<BR>
definitely prove that)
