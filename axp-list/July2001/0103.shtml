Hi,
<BR>
I happen to have an XL266 here, currrently running RH 6.2. Some time back I
<BR>
tried to upgrade to 7.0 but all kind of weird problems showed up. As most of
<BR>
you probably know the only available 'bios' for the XL266 is ARC, the
<BR>
predecessor of AlphaBIOS. The problems I had ranged from floppies suddenly
<BR>
not being readable to hanging system somewhere during boot.
<BR>
I still would like to give it a try with 7.1, if I only could get the ISO
<BR>
files downloaded.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Linus, would the recompile you did also work for the XL266? Do you have a
<BR>
complete description of what I need to know in advance from the XL266 and
<BR>
how I should do the (re)compile?
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>

Subject: RedHat 7.1 on a PC164 with milo
<BR>
<P><P>Hi all,
<BR>
as for all the poor folks who don't have a SRM-konsole (like me...), I 
<BR>
compiled a kernel with all the required options in it and copied it to the 
<BR>
boot-floppy. Together with an off-the-shelf ramdisk I managed to get RedHat 
<BR>
7.1 installed. And it's working quite good (writing this on it ;-)
<BR>
&nbsp;If you want to use it: I didn't use the milo and loadlin.exe from the 
<BR>
RedHat-CDs. The ones given with 7.1 don't work for me. So I took the ones 
<BR>
from 6.2 (or so I think. It's been a good while since!)
<BR>
&nbsp;I put an image of the bootdisk in 
<BR>
ftp.alphalinux.org/incoming/boot164.img
<BR>
&nbsp;Perhaps it might be worth putting up somewhere? I remember someone talking 
<BR>
about special tricks for special machines. Well, this one works for a PC164 
<BR>
with MLIO and an AIC7XXX. I think it should for others, too.
