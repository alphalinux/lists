<P>Misunderstanding.  He is talking about &quot;Rawhide&quot; machine type (a kind
<BR>
of Alpha board) and you, habitually I guess, :-) are mixing that up
<BR>
with &quot;rawhide&quot; Red Hat development stuff.  Jared installed 7.1 release.
<BR>
<P>Actually from my experience 7.1 is really stable as far as software
<BR>
goes.  There are some relatively minor gotchas; like 'eject' from
<BR>
a release is quite broken but that one from rawhide (the second sense :-)
<BR>
is ok.  You will find few other things like that and there are already
<BR>
some updates.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Our Quad Alpha runs 2.4.5-9 and seems to work fine.

<BR>
<P>And this seems to be the key element of your success.  The RH kernel
<BR>
2.4.3-12, which is packaged with 7.1 distribution, is in my experience
<BR>
a total turkey (yes, I wrote about that on bugzilla quite a while ago).
<BR>
I never run it long enough to see it crash but it is clear that it has
<BR>
serious virtual memory issues and I would not be surprised to see it
<BR>
blow up right away on an SMP machine.  OTOH there is really nothing
<BR>
which would force anybody to use that particular kernel apart of that
<BR>
that it comes precompiled on a CD and this is a truly minor reason.  One
<BR>
can use also something from 2.2 series as well if it works well for your
<BR>
purposes.
