<EM>&gt; All I did was to 'install' the kernel-source from RH7.1 on my RH6.2-system,

<P>Kernel is really _the least important_ part of the whole deal.  You can
<BR>
run 2.4 kernels on RH6.2 based systems for &quot;always&quot;.  Mind you - a
<BR>
number of packages should be updated.  In particular modutils (and they
<BR>
are still fine after that to run 2.2 kernels).  There are requirement
<BR>
listed in 'Documentation/Changes' file in kernel sources.  You may
<BR>
ignore them at your own risk but don't complain later about nasty
<BR>
surprises.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - One of the things you gotta take care of is to turn on the option 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CONFIG_ALPHA_LEGACY_START_ADDRESS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if not you get the kernel in a wrong adress space (that is, for MILO).
</EM><BR>
<P>That is actually quite important (but this has to be off for some
<BR>
&quot;high end&quot; machines which are not using milo :-).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  And, after all, I have to admit that I don't run a 2.4-kernel anymore. I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; switched back to good ol' 2.2.19, as it's the only one that runs stable on my 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system.
</EM><BR>
<P>And even if updated the whole software setup to RH 7.1 you are not
<BR>
really obliged to run, by the same token, a kernel from 2.4 series
<BR>
(you may need to install a &quot;generic&quot; version of glibc instead of a
<BR>
processor-optimized one - depending on your board).  The version of
<BR>
a kernel packaged with RH 7.1 is not a very good one in my experience.
<BR>
I even used an expression &quot;total turkey&quot; in some my older postings 
<BR>
on this list. :-)  There are other options and 2.2.19 is one of these.
<BR>
<P>Once again - a kernel version is nearly coincidental in a given
<BR>
distribution.  These are libraries and the whole &quot;user space&quot; which
<BR>
makes that difference.
