</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Thanks for the information.  I guess that it was not QLOGIC that

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Qlogic did not develop the driver that is in the kernel.  However, there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a driver from Qlogic that works with Linux.  However, &quot;Linux&quot; in this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sense means i386.  However, you can get the driver to work under Alpha.  The problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the Qlogic driver is that it assumes that sizeof(dma_addr_t) == BITS_PER_LONG.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On the Alpha, this is not the case.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If someone wants the patch I can send it out.
</EM><BR>
<P>Humm sounds like something tbat should be useful in the kernel. Was this patch never

accepted upstream? or am I going to horrified to find out it's not GPL code that we can

merge with the kernel?

<P><P><EM>&gt; I am running the Qlogic-4.27beta driver on an XP1000 quite successfully right
