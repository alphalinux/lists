Along those same lines, the &quot;NT ONLY&quot; tag dates to when you only had two
<BR>
choices, Digital Unix or NT.  I believe they cut a trace on the cpu that
<BR>
will disallow Digital Unix to run.

<P><P>John,
<BR>
<P>In addition to JJ's helpful information, I'd offer the project name of
<BR>
the system: it's a Corelle, which is, as JJ said, exactly -- i.e., not
<BR>
&quot;cut down&quot; -- an AS800, which runs Linux just fine.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
jwl

<P><P>hmm....
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sorry to bring this old one up again but I'm stuck. A 
<BR>
customer of ours has (very intelligently) decided to scrap NT
<BR>
on his alpha and move everything to linux. However he's got
<BR>
nowhere with the install. Part of this might be to do with the 
<BR>
hardware: it's a Digital Server 3300. Looking at the DEC product
<BR>
guide i see it's a 4/500MHz EV5w/2Mb cache and AlphaBIOS,
<BR>
but i haven't got a clue about the system type (someone here
<BR>
reckons it's a cut down as/800, which would make it a
<BR>
noritake, but it could be a miata). So, two questions:
<BR>
1) What sort of system is it?
<BR>
2) Anyone got linux on it yet?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can work out (1) I guess that (2) should be fairly
<BR>
straightforward. Unfortunately I haven't got physical access to
<BR>
the machine as it's somewhere in the vicinity of an oil rig 
<BR>
somewhere offshore....
