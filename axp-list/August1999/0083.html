<EM>&gt; My first question is what is the &quot;*&quot; for after the cylinder number?

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
The &quot;*&quot; means that it doesn't end in the cyl 114 as, exactly cyl 114. It
<BR>
means that like a fraction of cyl 114. This happens because the cyl that is
<BR>
shown there in fdisk are not the actual cyl. So fdisk has to convert
<BR>
between the actualy cyl and that (might be called) logical cyl.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Next, &quot;n&quot; and made partition &quot;b&quot; (going to be swap).  First Cylinder I put 114 (thinking that it should start where the last left off (from what I remember from Solaris SunOS days).  Select &quot;+64M&quot; for the size, resulting in this output from &quot;p&quot;:

This is wrong, it will overlap with the first partition and that's why
<BR>
you're getting this bogus size on the b label. You should start with the
<BR>
next cyl. And yes, you will loose some sectors if you start the b label on
<BR>
cyl 115 since the label a might not use the whole 114 cyl (remember we're
<BR>
talking about the logical cyl here).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; why is this?  What are the correct number of cylinders that I have to select from?  Can I divide up the 1018 by 4 GB to achieve a decent measure of how I can divide up the disk?  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
because it's not the actuall cyl.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What should I have done to be able to utilize BSD style formating successfully?  What do I need to do to get swriteboot to work correctly (am guessing that the answer here is that I need to install on my BSD style of labeling).  Here are the things that I tried with swriteboot.  I do see the syntax for swriteboot (shown by not entering any arguments), but couldn't see anything obvious.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
I suggest you use sector as the base unit instead of that logical cyl, you
<BR>
can do that before pressing b to go to the BSD disklabel menu, press u to
<BR>
change the unit to sectors. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Swriteboot *fl /dev/sda /boot/bootlx
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; #message received:  swriteboot: partition number must be in range 1-8#
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; #
</EM><BR>
i'm not sure about that &quot;*&quot; there. Also, since you're not making any
<BR>
partition on the first cyl, you do not need to supply -f1 nor -f3 (since
<BR>
you don't make any whole disk label).
<BR>
<P>Just create something like this:
<BR>
&nbsp;a:	Do not start at cyl 0/1, starts at &gt;=2
<BR>
&nbsp;b:	start's at the NEXT sector (if a ends at sec 1000, starts at 1001)
<BR>
&nbsp;c:	same thing (and note this is not whole disk label! just use this as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr)
<BR>
<P>and set a = swap, b and c = ext2 ( / and /usr respectively)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; #swriteboot /dev/sda /boot/bootlx *f3
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; open disk device: No such file or directory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; swriteboot *fl /dev/sda /boot/bootlx *f3
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; # partition number range error message again (see above)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; #
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
with that setup above (a, b, c) you don't even need to specify -f1 or -f3
<BR>
those are if you create a partition a (unused) starts at cyl 0/1 and start
<BR>
with partition b as swap etc, that you need -f1 to overwrite the first
<BR>
partition with bootlx. And -f3 also not needed unless you have whole disk
<BR>
partition.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I believe that swriteboot is writing boot information to the disk (/dev/sda) in the space that was provided (by starting the install on cylinder 2).  What is the signifance of /boot/bootlx?  This is not the kernel, so it must be the bootfile - is the bootfile being copied to the first cylinder - and if it is, can I see the bootfile (not to examine it, but just to be able to identify the location on the CD) on my 5.2 Install CD?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
swriteboot writes on the first cyl on the /dev/sda. Not in your first
<BR>
partition. Bootlx is just the bootloader (correct me if I'm wront) i think
<BR>
it contains aboot.
