Hello - I have just installed RH 6.0 for Alpha on my system.  I am one of
<BR>
the people making the switch from AlphaNT to Linux.. I am new to Linux..
<BR>
<P>I am using an AS200 4/233
<BR>
144mb memory
<BR>
4GB Seagate Barracuda SCSI
<BR>
Number Nine Video Card with PowerStorm 3D - (boxed with the system)
<BR>
Toshiba 32x SCSI CD rom..
<BR>
<P>I have everything configured and the system is booting fine from my hard
<BR>
disk..
<BR>
<P>The first time I was in Gnome I was moving a panel around with the mouse and
<BR>
the entire desktop locked up HARD.. I had to power off/on to clear the
<BR>
screen.
<BR>
<P>On boot up - I received a couple
<BR>
data corruption errors from the hard power down.
<BR>
I boot up again just fine after the disk was scanned for
<BR>
errors..
<BR>
<P>When I enter startx for Gnome - I get the beginnings of the desktop and the
<BR>
system locks up again.  The screen locks up as soon at the toes of the Gnome
<BR>
footprint
<BR>
is displayed.
<BR>
<P>Basically it seems the keyboard and mouse are disconneted from the system at
<BR>
this point.
<BR>
No combination of CTL-ATL-F1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 or others can unlock the
<BR>
system.
<BR>
I must power off and on to reboot.  When I reboot I get warnings that data
<BR>
has been corrupted and
<BR>
the diskscan operation is run during bootup.
<BR>
<P>I had this problem earlier this week.  I had to re-install RH 6.0 to clear
<BR>
up the problem..  The problem keeps coming back..
<BR>
<P>Has anyone seen a problem where Gnome locks up your system?
<BR>
<P>Thank you in advance for your help.
<BR>
