<EM>&gt; Anyone know if this is true, people emailed they had similiar setups,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; although I don't think anyone explicitly said the SYM53C896 (dual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; channel lvd) works great with Redhat-6.0 on alpha, many said they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have similiar setups working.

<P>I've used two different 895 based cards. I've had timeout
<BR>
problems depending on which kernel level I use. The issue
<BR>
seems to be that the sym/ncr drivers detect incorrect 
<BR>
frequency counts for 21264 based systems, at least sometimes.
<BR>
<P>I sent a workaround to the problem over the weekend. Check 
<BR>
the archives. If ncr/sym say your card is more than 40000 KHZ,
<BR>
it won't work, at least none do on my XP1000. As of today,
<BR>
I've had my XP1000 up under 2.2.11 for 2 days with the fix
<BR>
and have moved a minimum of 50GB on the disks attached to
<BR>
two ncr53c8xx cards without problems. Also, it can sustain
<BR>
20+MB/sec so I know it's running UW on both cards.
<BR>
<P>Since your card is a dual channel card, it probably has a
<BR>
PCI to PCI bridge built in, at least my Adaptec 3940 does
<BR>
and it's dual channel. If you can, try a single channel card
<BR>
and if necessary the workaround and see if it behaves. I
<BR>
expect to have 4 DS10's shortly so I can do similar tests.
<BR>
If the tests go well, that will expand quickly to more DS10's.
<BR>
<P>You can find cheap single channel cards via the shopping/
<BR>
comparison sites quite easily. I like the Tekram DC390F
<BR>
for price/performance (have two at the moment). I do need
<BR>
to make sure it boots but it's devices show up under SRM
<BR>
so I assume it will be OK.
