<EM>&gt; i have a multia with redhat 6.0 on it, and i would like to know if it is

<EM>&gt; possible to run it w/o a monitor or keyboard?  if so, how do i go about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doing this?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do not need access to the console (i.e. Linux already
<BR>
installed and boots automatically), then just pull the monitor and
<BR>
keyboard cables, place it where you want, connect power and network (will
<BR>
be quite useless without at least these two), and turn it on. After a few
<BR>
minutes it should appear on the network.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if you want access to the linux console, the 2.2.x kernels
<BR>
have support for console on a serial port, activated via a kernel
<BR>
parameter (i.e. from milo). Don't know specifics of this (if you get a
<BR>
shell there or not or one needs to set up a getty there). This is also
<BR>
possible with earlier kernels, but not quite so straight forward or clean.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trickest part is getting access to SRM and ARC w/o
<BR>
monitor+keyboard. It is possible, as when the system boots, it will detect
<BR>
that there is not a keyboard and do I/O through the first serial port (std
<BR>
pins on the 25pin serial connector). As far as I know the srm console is
<BR>
completely accessible this way. The ARC on the other hand, while it will
<BR>
display its initial menu, can not be interfaced with as arrow keys from
<BR>
about any terminal emulation I have tried are not recongized correctly. In
<BR>
other words, you can see the ARC loader, and if set to auto-boot, it will
<BR>
boot, but you can not choose any menu options other than the default one.
<BR>
:(
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really bad in my case where my keyboard and monitor ports
<BR>
are toast (my UDB has seen too many battles), and only the serial port
<BR>
works, and the CMOS battery died, so the NVRAM is invalid, and I can't
<BR>
boot the system at all. :(
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, hope this clears things up for you. If you find a way to
<BR>
interact with ARC via a serial console, I would be very interested to hear
<BR>
how you did it! TTYL.
