<P>I have seen something, so far only on dp264, which **may** be related to
<BR>
that.  On various occasions with **the same** version of a driver, on
<BR>
the same machine and without touching anything in a controller itself I
<BR>
see reports &quot;NCR clock is xKHz&quot; (this is from ncr_getclock() in
<BR>
sym53c8xx.c) where x is either 21626, or 40037 or 80074.  The third case
<BR>
is followed by &quot;PCI clock seems too high&quot; and no disks.  It does not
<BR>
appear to matter which of the other two values was chosen - things
<BR>
are ok in both cases.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This has happened on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 875/875J/895 so it isn't isolated to a single type
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of card.

<P>What I see seems to be related how a kernel was built (configuration and
<BR>
maybe a compiler itself) but I still cannot point to a culprit with any
<BR>
conviction.  I start to suspect some timing issues in reading an
<BR>
information from a hardware/firmware.  Maybe some delays are not not
<BR>
long enough for ev6?  Messing with a disk controller without knowing
<BR>
what I am really doing does not strike me as a very exciting option;
<BR>
especially when I cannot predict which clock value will show up.

<P>You know that this is safe or it just happens to work?
