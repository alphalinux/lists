<EM>&gt; NIC, ddoes anyone have suggestions for a fast ethernet card that works with

<EM>&gt; alpha linux
</EM><BR>
<P>Must be something specific to the Kingston card.
<BR>
I use several brands of 2114x based cards plus
<BR>
built-in's and they all work well, as long as you
<BR>
use the latest tulip.c from Becker's site.
<BR>
<P>Netgear FA310TX (old ones, the new ones use a different chip)
<BR>
Netgear new cards are supposed to work. I don't have one 
<BR>
though. Might pick one up and try it. They have a driver on
<BR>
their site but I don't know if it's Intel only or??
<BR>
<P>21143's built into XP1000/DS10's.
<BR>
<P>Linksys Etherfast 100-TX (21140)
<BR>
<P>SVEC (21142 or 21143, can't remember)
<BR>
<P>Also have a D-Link 530tx, a via-rhine card but had trouble
<BR>
with it initially so it's not installed in anything at the
<BR>
moment.
