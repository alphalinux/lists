<P>
Thanks all,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I received many suggestions (I owe everyone involved many thanks)  
<BR>
But in the end it seems that one of 2 things is true:
<BR>
<P>1.  The motherboard, pci bus or similiar was damaged.
<BR>
<P>2.  The SYM53c896 isn't 64 bit clean, or doesn't like being behind a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PCI bridge or similiar.
<BR>
<P>I base my conclusions on trying endless combos of:
<BR>
<P>1.  Linux-2.2.3 (generic-up-223)+ redhat-5.2 ramdisk.img (since 2.2.3 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doesn't handle romfs).
<BR>
<P>2.  same with the rh6.0 generic.img + rh6.0 errate update for ramdisk.
<BR>
<P>3.  Linux-2.2.11 + redhat-6.0 ramdisk.img on cd (newer kernel has romfs).
<BR>
<P>4.  Linux-2.2.11 + redhat-6.0 errate update for ramdisk.img.
<BR>
<P>5.  Linux-2.3.11+rth1+rth2 + redhat ramdisk errata version
<BR>
<P>6.  Most kernels + compatible ramdisk + 4 GB eide disk... everything
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seemed to work great.  Did full install and left the machine
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;running for a day or so.
<BR>
<P>All the above either failed miserably because of not having a rom fs,
<BR>
command line mistakes, or other compatibilities.  But by the time I was
<BR>
done I had many &quot;bootable&quot; combos that would fail after installing
<BR>
10-20 packages (after selecting timezone, packages to install, mke2fs,
<BR>
and similiar).  I also noticed that the NCR53c896 driver actually
<BR>
has reasonable parity error reports, while the SYM driver
<BR>
seems to have less accurate error reports.
<BR>
<P>I then was guessing that my cable setup was wrong, or that the
<BR>
cable or terminators were bad.  My first step was to transfer the
<BR>
controller, cable, disk, and terminator to an x86, which worked
<BR>
great, did a full redhat-6.0 install quickly with no errors/locks or 
<BR>
similiar.  The full redhat-6.0 is &gt;= 500 packages I believe the alphas
<BR>
were dying before package 50...
<BR>
<P>So that leaves me with the driver not liking alphas, pci bridges,
<BR>
or similiar or broken hardware.  I'll call the vendor tomorrow.  I'm
<BR>
open to suggestions for anything else to try, I have an older 21164 as
<BR>
well as many x86's to help.
<BR>
<P>Oh I did get a statement from the vendor:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;This machine [DS-10] has been downgraded to RedHat 5.2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Kernels built on RH6.0 (egcs-1.1.2) will not boot with the Symbios 53c896
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Kernels built on RH 5.2 (egcs-1.0.3a) do not demonstrate this problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The appropiate people at Compaq, RedHat and intraserver have been made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aware of this problem and a fix will be made available.
</EM><BR>
<P>Anyone know if this is true, people emailed they had similiar setups,
<BR>
although I don't think anyone explicitly said the SYM53C896 (dual
<BR>
channel lvd) works great with Redhat-6.0 on alpha, many said they
<BR>
have similiar setups working.
<BR>
<P>Any clarification greatly appreciated, as is any addiitonal troubleshooting
<BR>
ideas before I call the vendor.
<BR>
<P>Many thanks
<BR>
