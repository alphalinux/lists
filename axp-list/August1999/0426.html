OK, I've had an Alpha for about six months or so, and I'd like to do a
<BR>
bit more development on it (instead of my intel boxes).  
<BR>
<P>I've submitted a few kernel patches (some of which have been accepted
<BR>
8^) ), but I actually think the user-space tools are in a worse state
<BR>
than the kernel, and would like to help.  I have a few questions for
<BR>
the alpha gurus:
<BR>
<P>1)A lot of programs (eg rh6 ping) cause the occasional &quot;unaligned
<BR>
trap&quot;.  I understand that these are caused by instructions that are
<BR>
not aligned correctly in memory, and that that means the processor has
<BR>
to do some special magic to run them, which slows stuff down.  How do
<BR>
I find and eliminate the error?
<BR>
<P>2)I can't get xemacs to build.  Any hints?
<BR>
<P>3)Mozilla seems pretty shaky.  Is there a &quot;healthy&quot; milestone build
<BR>
that works OK on alpha?  I don't use the mail components, but just
<BR>
want a browser for the odd times when &quot;lynx&quot; doesn't tell all.
<BR>
<P>4)Any joy with emm-x86 on the 2.2.x series kernels?
<BR>
<P>5)Is milo still under active development?  I can't get it to build
<BR>
against new kernels, which is a pain, because the version I use
<BR>
doesn't have the best driver for my scsi card.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for any/all replies.
<BR>
