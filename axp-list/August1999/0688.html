<EM>&gt;Now, Linux gets its own credit card
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;By Tom Dunlap
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Staff Writer, CNET News.com
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;August 27, 1999, 4:00 a.m. PT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Give Linux fans a little credit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Or at least, give them a credit card.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That's the plan of Benjamin Cox, founder of the Linux Fund, who will offer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people credit cards emblazoned with the Linux penguin mascot.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Although he hopes to make a comfortable living from the project, Cox isn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;just trying to make a quick buck. The goal of the non-profit initiative is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to channel proceeds toward worthy open-source development projects.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Cox is the latest of a breed of entrepreneurs who sees the opportunity to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;find a little money in the Linux phenomenon. And though his project is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;comparatively small, some big names are involved as well--such as venture
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;capital firms Benchmark, Sequoia, and Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Cox has he's signed a deal for the cards through MBNA, a company that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;provides credit cards tailored to appeal to fans of everything from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;National Football League to Star Trek. Under the deal, a percentage of each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;charge made on the credit card with the credit card is diverted into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Linux Fund.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The organization recently added an online application to his site and signed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;up more than 400 interested people at the LinuxWorld Conference and Expo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;earlier this month, he said. If he can sign up 100,000 people, that would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;provide an estimated $2 million a year to fund development projects and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;scholarships, he said.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The development projects will be selected by a board of developers familiar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with the software, said Mark Willey, a member of the board. Projects will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;peer reviewed, he added.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Cox's Linux Fund project shouldn't be confused with another Linux Fund,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which aims to invest money in Linux companies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;VC interest in Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Deeper pockets have become interested in Linux and other open-source
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;projects recently. Benchmark Capital, a noted Silicon Valley firm that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;typically provides funding to projects just getting off the ground, is one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;such outfit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Kevin Harvey, the Benchmark partner who deals with open-source projects,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;said he considers his firm the leading venture capital firm in terms of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;backing open-source projects--the efforts such as Linux where programmers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;may freely share the software's original programming instructions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Benchmark benefited from Red Hat's initial public offering and has taken a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stake in Collab.net, whose core project is the SourceXchange site where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;programmers can bid for open-source projects. Other efforts are in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pipeline, he added.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Harvey said SourceXchange will begin with less glamorous projects, such as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;those a company wants to outsource instead devote its own programmers to.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But later, he expects it to house many more serious efforts. Companies will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be able to save money hiring programming talent, and programmers will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;able to work from all over the world.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;There's talent all over the world that would love to be able to work and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;live where they want to and find their clients over the Internet,&quot; Harvey
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;said.
