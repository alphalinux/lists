<P>
<EM>&gt; Greetings -
</EM><BR>
<P>Welcome to the Dark Side ;)  I'm on the AlphaNT list as well as the
<BR>
AlphaLinux list so it's good to see you asking questions.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I would like to move the machine to AlphaLinux and forget about NT.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've been using AlphaLinux as my main box on an AlphaStation 200
<BR>
166MHz and then onto an SX 533MHz.  Everything from word processing
<BR>
to personal programs.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Is there a Web browser - e-mail client (like outlook) - and basic Word
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; processor for Alpha Linux.
</EM><BR>
<P>Web Browser is the problem.  Nothing as good as IE or Netscape on
<BR>
AlphaNT yet.  Right now Netscape 5.0 Beta (Mozilla) is 64bit clean and
<BR>
coming along.  But, the best browser I've found for me is in KDE.  The
<BR>
file manager in KDE is a nice fast and very usable browser.
<BR>
<P>Word Processing.  ApplixWare is native on AlphaLinux.  It has some key
<BR>
binding stuff that will drive you a little nuts if you are moving from
<BR>
Windows programs.  (like no shift - end to select to the end of a line
<BR>
etc.)
<BR>
<P>For $89 it comes with Word Processor, Spread Sheet, Mail Client,
<BR>
Presentations Program, and Database Access.
<BR>
<P>Email.  More applications than you can shake a stick at.  I use KMail
<BR>
(which comes with KDE).  It is rather nice.  It will read HTML, but not
<BR>
compose in HTML (which seems to be the thing that most people in the
<BR>
Linux world want).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What are most people using their AlphaLinux systems to run?
</EM><BR>
<P>I like Fractal Stuff, so I do graphics, movies, cd mastering, standard
<BR>
Math programs and general use applications.
<BR>
<P>Samples:
<BR>
POV-Ray (raytracer)
<BR>
Blender (3D Modeler)
<BR>
Various MPEG Encoders
<BR>
Various MP3 Players and Encoders
<BR>
ApplixWare
<BR>
Scilab
<BR>
Euler
<BR>
Xaos
<BR>
XFractint
<BR>
Code Crusader (IDE)
<BR>
Code Medic (IDE Debugger)
<BR>
GIMP
<BR>
the KDE suite of Applications
<BR>
etc. etc. etc.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is there a place where I can get help for reformatting the system to run
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AlphaLinux?
</EM><BR>
<P>Here. The AlphaLinux newsgroup.  Your local LUG.
<BR>
<P>Where do you live?  I'll burn the RedHat 6.0 cd along with the updates
<BR>
and some extra applications, then mail them to you if you want.
<BR>
<P>That is so cool about Linux.  I can just burn a copy for a friend and
<BR>
not worry about going to jail :)  Of course you can purchase the
<BR>
latest from RedHat and get tech support through them.
