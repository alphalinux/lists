<P>It is very surprising to me to see messages posted on the topic of turning
<BR>
the DEC 3000's into useful machines again ;).
<BR>
<P>Can anyone tell me what happened to the old(er) effort led by Michael
<BR>
Engel?  When I actually managed to reach him earlier this year, he said
<BR>
that their group's efforts included a port to the DEC 3000 series as well.
<BR>
His port page can be found at <A HREF="http://decstation.unix-ag.org">http://decstation.unix-ag.org</A>  .
<BR>
<P>Note also for all working on this latest port effort that they have many
<BR>
useful links on their web site.
<BR>
<P>Just for fun, let me throw in what I know (and think I know) about the
<BR>
history behind the DECstations.  Please know that I am not certain about
<BR>
all of this, but am reasonably certain about most of it :).
<BR>
<P>&lt;history&gt;
<BR>
<P>It seems the 5000 series came first.  It is based on the MIPS CPU
<BR>
architecture, but surprisingly has such a similar design to the 3000 series
<BR>
that they can almost be considered the same, even from a driver's-eye-view.
<BR>
&nbsp;The only appreciable difference it seems is that your compile target is
<BR>
MIPS and not Alpha.  Every other device in the box seems to be wired the
<BR>
exact same way as the 3000's.
<BR>
<P>MIPS came first because DEC (now Compaq) had not yet released the first
<BR>
Alphas.  At the time of DEC 5000, DEC was a member of the MIPS consortium
<BR>
(along with IBM and SGI).  However, shortly after the DEC 5000, DEC pulled
<BR>
out of MIPS and released its own CPU, the Alpha 21064.  DEC promptly
<BR>
changed the CPU on the DECstations to Alpha, and the new boxes were called
<BR>
the 3000 series.
<BR>
<P>What's even more surprising is that there is PALcode in the 3000 series
<BR>
which will enable them to execute native MIPS instructions.  DEC actually
<BR>
left the system Flash exactly the same (using MIPS instructions), and just
<BR>
tweaked the PALcode Flash to perfectly emulate a MIPS.  So when you boot a
<BR>
3000 (assuming you haven't re-flashed the board), the CPU initially
<BR>
executes MIPS code, which theoretically is the exact same boot code on the
<BR>
5000 series.
<BR>
<P>&lt;/history&gt;
<BR>
<P>If this latest effort is indeed different from Michael's team, good luck to
<BR>
you.  I have been wholly unsuccessful in contacting anyone from Michael's
<BR>
team for more than one email.  Perhaps he is too busy with his port for the
<BR>
likes of me :&gt; ...?
<BR>
<P>Let me also say that I have acquired a DECstation 3000 model 300LX, and
<BR>
will happily serve as a guinea pig for anything you have to try.  Due to an
<BR>
unfortunate agreement I had to sign with my employer, I cannot participate
<BR>
in actual DEVELOPMENT of the kernel for the DEC 3000, which I would dearly
<BR>
like to help with since I have quite a bit of hardware programming
<BR>
experience.  Therefore I must resign myself to the lowly position of
<BR>
alpha-tester :(.
<BR>
<P>If anyone knows more about port efforts for the DEC 3000, by all means post
<BR>
to this list and explain.
