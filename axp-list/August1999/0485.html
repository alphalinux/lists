<P>check out this link for info about the drive connector -- I've never heard
<BR>
of such a thing, but the pictures here should make it fairly easy to build a
<BR>
converter. the only thing you have to be careful about is to use the 5 volt
<BR>
part of the drive connector to hook into those other 4 pins, and NOT the 12
<BR>
volt -- twelve volt would fry the drive from what the specs say. pins 41 and
<BR>
42 should have 5vdc on them and pin 43 is your ground.  pin 44 is not used
<BR>
(it says 'reserved' in the spec sheet).

Subject: RH6.0 on UDP/Multia
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;I got my 'free' Multia this week and got a copy of RH6.0 for alpha in an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;attempt to get this, my first non-Intel system running. I have run into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some unexpected problems, and those may be because of my naivity or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ignorance of what I was getting myself into, but I am sure I am not the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only one and I hope this is the right place to ask questions about it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I have just joined this list, but didn't see any mention of an FAQ, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if there is any (apart from the normal HOWTOs) I would like to know.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I have been using Linux since the SLS (pre-Slackware) distribution and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some 0.99 kernel so I may be a newbie to Alpha, but not in general :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I got my UDB from eBiz (www.thelinuxstore.com) as you may have guessed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and I ordered it to come with 32MB RAM and an IDE HD, and I got the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;FD from Starship Computer. As I have a PS/2 keyboard and mouse and a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;SVGA capable monitor I thought everything would be fairly easy at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with the hardware, but it doesn't seem to be.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;1. I am yet not able to find an IDE cable to connect the HD (2.5&quot; Seagate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   ST91685AG), which seems to be very special as it needs a 44pin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   female-female cable that also carries the power-supply to connect to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   the motherboard. Unfortunately, eBiz didn't have such a cable and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   didn't know it would be such a pain to find. The HD doesn't have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   normal power-supply connector which makes it impossible to fiddle with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   44pin -&gt; 40pin -&gt; 44pin adapters and such. I don't even know where to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   get the connectors as spareparts because all the shops I went to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   almost balked when I mentioned something that didn't include the two
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   letters &quot;P&quot; and &quot;C&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If you have a clue as to what to do here I would really appreciate it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I was able to start up the boot process with the three floppy disks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;described and I intend to install by NFS mounting the CDROM from one of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;my other machines. If you know of any quirks or something I should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;careful about, please don't hesitate to tell me. Even RH installation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is a first as I have always used Slackware, and I can't imagine a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;distribution easier and more flexible ;-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Thank you very much,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
