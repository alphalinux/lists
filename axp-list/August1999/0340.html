<P>
A follow up on my latest parts.
<BR>
<P>I've tested 2 Tekram DC390F's, a Tekram DC390U2W, and a
<BR>
Digitalscape Datastorm32. Results:
<BR>
<P>DC390F: SRM recognizes it and it's disks. Does not like
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fact my cables exceed UW length (3m, I'm around 3.5m)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and occasionally does SCSI bus resets. A 53c875
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;based card, cost was $75.
<BR>
DC390U2W: SRM doesn't recognize it's devices. Handles my
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cables being overlength because it uses a special
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transceiver chip to allow separating UW from U2W.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 53c895 based card, cost was $168.
<BR>
DataStorm32: SRM doesn't recognize it's devices. Does not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like my overlength cabling. A 53c895 based card
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but doesn't use the transceiver chip, cost was $138.
<BR>
<P>Also:
<BR>
Fireport40: SRM doesn't recognize it's devices. Does not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like overlength cables. A 53c875J based card. I
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forgot what I paid for it.
<BR>
<P>All cards are recognized by Linux. The issue is whether SRM
<BR>
sees them.
<BR>
<P>I still have the Qlogic 1040B differential card and the
<BR>
IWILL 2935UW card to try. After looking over the IWILL
<BR>
though, I'm betting it won't work, but I'll still try it.
<BR>
It appears to be based on an Initio INIC-950P chip. Their
<BR>
web site does say it works with Linux so it's probably OK
<BR>
with Intel systems. Anyway, It's looking like the Tekram
<BR>
DC390F is the way to go if you use SRM.
<BR>
<P>A side note:
<BR>
<P>One thing I read about the Qlogic driver that may explain
<BR>
the problem I had while fixating with my Yamaha CDR-RW is
<BR>
that it doesn't support disconnect. Also, under SRM, the
<BR>
Yamaha CDR-RW shows devices for ALL LUN's at it's SCSI id.
<BR>
I suspect that may give some SCSI drivers trouble.
