<P>
| 1. Obvious problem: Crashing font server. But symptoms seem to indicate
<BR>
| more extensive problems. I'll try Peter Petrakis' suggestion (20May 1999)
<BR>
| and put the font path directly into the XF86config file.
<BR>
<P>Works well that way. The main problem I had was the xfs would cause X's cpu
<BR>
utillization go to 100% when a motif app called for fonts. That and random
<BR>
lockups and crashes were all due to the fontserver.
<BR>
<P>| Right now, only AfterStep will not run at all. startx fails.
<BR>
| xdm logins fail. Only gdm and kdm logins work and are moderately
<BR>
| stable. I have never gotten xterm to work. I prefer using startx
<BR>
| on this machine.
<BR>
<P>There are a multitude of updates for redhat 6.0 already. They include fixes
<BR>
to Xfree, the xfs (which still does not fix my problem), xterm, rxvt, ping,
<BR>
xscreensaver, and the list goes on. Do not install the dev update or be
<BR>
prepared to fix the permissions on all your devices. Xscreensaver still does
<BR>
not function properly after the update due to an X authourity problem. To
<BR>
fix it insert the line &quot;xhost +localhost&quot; at the end of your
<BR>
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0 . Since I disabled the font server and did
<BR>
all the updates I haven't had a problem with X since. I also use
<BR>
gdm/enlightenment.
<BR>
<P>| This thread stopped shortly after Peter's suggestion. Did this clean up
<BR>
| most problems? It would be nice to know.
<BR>
<P>Yes :-)
<BR>
<P>| 2. nfs fails with &quot;permission denied&quot; errors to my backup machine. It
<BR>
| appears that rpc.nfsd daemon never starts. This is found both from
<BR>
| &quot;ps ax|grep nfsd&quot; ('')
<BR>
| and &quot;/etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs status&quot;. (message: &quot;nfs is stopped&quot; and
<BR>
| no pid reported) I only began investigating this, but I have been
<BR>
| using nfs successfully for a long time and think I understand the basics.
<BR>
| /etc/hosts.allow has proper entries. /etc/hosts.deny exists, but has no
<BR>
| entries yet. There is no /etc/hosts.equiv.
<BR>
<P>I can't help you with the nfs stuff. Sorry.
<BR>
<P>Peter
