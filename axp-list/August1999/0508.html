<EM>&gt; &gt; Good luck. With NT on Alpha going away, I would guess AlphaBIOS will also

<EM>&gt; &gt; go the same way.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What - since when did that get decided?
</EM><BR>
<P>AlphaBIOS really exists for one purpose, to boot NT. Linux, OpenVMS and
<BR>
Tru64 can all be booted from SRM. I beleive it is Compaq's plans to have
<BR>
new Alpha hardware boot Linux from SRM. So that begs the question, why
<BR>
would AlphaBIOS still be developed?
<BR>
<P>Granted, there may be a few more revisions for vital bug fixes etc....but
<BR>
I would guess it's almost come to an end.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; There is a slightly newer version at www.alpha-processor.com for the LX
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; boards. I think it's 5.68-1, it might help with some of the problems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you've seen.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks - the history definitly doesn't suggest that - but there is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; history hole between 5.66 and 5.68 - hmm.
</EM><BR>
<P>5.66 was (I think) the last version that Dec/Compaq did for the LX. After
<BR>
that production was done by Samsung in Korea and they did a new release of
<BR>
the AlphaBIOS (5.68-1).
