I had something similar happen once... turned out the CPU fan was the
<BR>
problem.  If the CPU fan doesn't run, the board won't power up... won't do
<BR>
a thing.

<EM>&gt; I have AlphaServer 2100 5/250 with cirrus GD5430.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I just installed RHL6.0 and everything is setup but the X.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And since I cannot get it to work with X, today I thought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I want to try something different, which is changing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; video card. I did open the box, took off the video card..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; replace it, and then i also took off the CPU board and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memory board just for curiosity. Then i put back everything,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and now.. it won't run anymore. (I put back everything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the place where they were before)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Infact, it won't even do anything when I push the power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; button. It seems like the power supply had died, but if I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; check the back, the power supply AC light is ON!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But again, if I press the power on button, nothing happened.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not even a FAN or HD spinning.. nothing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I hope I did not damage the machine. Any ideas anyone?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm really desperate now.. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I finally got an alpha machine, and it died after a week. =(
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *arrrgghh*
