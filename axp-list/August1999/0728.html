HI! And welcome to the real world of Linux!  :)
<BR>
With Dec (er.. excuse me Compaq) dumping NT support, I think we're going to see
<BR>
a lot of you types here! Glad to see this. This may be the single biggest boon
<BR>
to Linux ever contrived!
<BR>
<P>On to those of your questions that I can answer:

<EM>&gt; What windowmanager is generaly considered to be the most stable/supported one out there(MetroLink, Xi or Xfree86)? Preferably hardware accelerated stuff.
</EM><BR>
<P>MetroX, X1, XFree86, are not window managers. They're X graphics systems.
<BR>
(they're the &quot;back end&quot; to the window managers). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which to use&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They're all good. However:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XFree86 is free. It's a solid performer, and so widely used that it probably
<BR>
has the best support structure that you could as for. But be aware: It's a free
<BR>
product. It's not without it's problems. Configuring it is a little harder than
<BR>
some of the other X systems. I use it on my Alpha, and it's never let me down.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MetroX (By Metrolink). Again, a solid performer, but limited in it's support of
<BR>
graphics cards &amp; monitors. XFree86 supports a wider base of cards. You have to
<BR>
pay for MetroX, but the price is reasonable (_about_ $40 USD or so). It's easier
<BR>
to configure, if that's an issue. And the support from Metrolink is fair. I'm
<BR>
running it on an Intel box. Again, a solid performer. But be aware: You still
<BR>
need to install &quot;parts&quot; of XFree86. There are subsystems built into Linux that
<BR>
require it. Not a big deal.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xi. The Rolls Royce of them all. It's the most expensive out there (That I'm
<BR>
aware of). I've never run it, but know folks that do. performance wise: It's
<BR>
probably the fastest of the bunch, but can be problematic. 
<BR>
<P>Personally: I'd start with XFree86. It's included with Redhat. If it doesn't
<BR>
work for you, then look into one of the alternatives.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The same goes for Audio(OSS or something else)?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
OSS. Absolutely nothing else will do.  :)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, there is good sound support built into the kernel. I'd look into that
<BR>
first. If you can't get it to run your sound card, then look into OSS.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; is there any DDR(PVR, Digisuite, ...) support or any support in progress?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass...  Dunno!
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any Faq압 around of Linux/NT networking stuff(samba)?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
When you install SAMBA, there is a doc directory
<BR>
(/usr/docs/samba-&lt;version.number&gt;. It's chocked full of information,
<BR>
documentation, examples, and sample smb.conf files for various configurations.
<BR>
In short: Most of the help you'll need.
<BR>
However, should you still need help getting it running (and it &quot;can&quot; be
<BR>
challenging.. I know, I was building one last night), you have several
<BR>
resources:
<BR>
Check out:	<A HREF="http://samba.org">http://samba.org</A>	(the samba home site)
<BR>
or you can post questions here!  :)
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; anyone know when the API sponsored development package will be released(cygnus I think)?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass . . . Dunno
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any ETA on the DEC GEM C/C++ compiler Beta??
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ditto . . . Dunno
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and finaly and the most inportant: ANY GAMES??(realy need friday night Quake fests at the office)
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah. Quake is out there for Alpha. Try looking at quakeworld for a starter.
<BR>
They should have something, or know where to get it. I think I saw both client &amp;
<BR>
server side pkgs there not too long ago. Been a while though. I don't so many
<BR>
games.
<BR>
<P>Hope that helps!
