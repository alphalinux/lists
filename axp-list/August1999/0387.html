<EM>&gt;         Based on the advice of this list, I purchased a Yamaha 4416S CD-R
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and installed it in XLT Alpha. I have been able to master and burn data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CD-R and CD-RWs with no problem, and with very good performance. Though I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hit a problem when I went to copy a data CD. I am using xcdroast (version
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 0.96e-3) for all interaction with the CD-R drive. The problem is when I go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to read the CD I want to copy to hard disk, 99% of the CD is copied and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then a kernel panic occurs. It is difficult to tell exactly what happened
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as nothing is saved to any log and the messages fly past the screen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (console) relatively quickly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         I can tell that scsi errors occur, and then there is a kernel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; panic, followed by a very hard lock (SysRq key combs are all that work).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There is some messages about an interrupt handler failing and then the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; swapper dying.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         The CD-R is on the onboard NCR8xxx SCSI controller chain, along
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the system disk, but the disk that data is being copied to is on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seperate SCSI controller. The scsi error appear to be coming from the CD-R
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drive, and the entire sequence of events is very repeatable (just try and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; copy a CD), even after trying 2.2.9, 2.2.5, and 2.2.7 kernel version.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         So, is this a kernel bug, an xcdroast bug, or something else? It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looks like xcdroast is trying to read beyond the end of the device. What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do I need to do to keep it from doing this? Thanks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Why not just mount the disk you want to copy, and
<BR>
make your own iso image from it? Keep in mind RH
<BR>
images do support CD boot so you need to add those
<BR>
args. 
<BR>
<P>I tried something similar to that with my HP CDR
<BR>
and never got it to work until I mounted it and
<BR>
made an image. System didn't lock up though, so
<BR>
symptom was just a garbage disk. (4-5 of them)
<BR>
I know better now than to try it again and waste 
<BR>
CDR blanks. If someone has the proper incantation
<BR>
to make it work, I'd also like to know what it
<BR>
is.
