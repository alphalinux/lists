This is better idea, to put in a separate case.

<P><EM>&gt; The Atlas 10K is advertised as the fastest disk around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so I would expect it to run hot. Probably not as hot
</EM><BR>
I didn't know about ad, but it's quite fast.  Not as hot as SEAGATE.

<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Have you tested Intraserver cards? They seems very nice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maurice recommends them highly at Hard Data. I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happen to have one so I can't say much one way or the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other. I did look and they sell two models, one for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; NT and another for Tru64. The Tru64 model was a bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expensive at over $300. I can get a real Compaq part
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for less than that. The NT part was $150 or so.
</EM><BR>
Yes, the difference is fee involved in driver that Intraserver 
<BR>
has to pay to Compaq.  And yes, Maurice recommends them, and
<BR>
we buy lots of them too.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm collecting info on what's compatible in order
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to decide how to configure some DS10's. Particularly,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what SCSI cards work and what video works. I suspect if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a card works on my XP1000, it will work in the DS10.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If someone knows otherwise, please let me know.
</EM><BR>
<P>I recommend to get bigger box for better cooling.
<BR>
for graphic card, I recommend ELSA gloria for Tru64 UNIX.
<BR>
For linux, there should be cheaper 8MBs.
<BR>
SCSI card wise, I'd still go with Intraserver for optimized performance.
