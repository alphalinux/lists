<EM>&gt; bbnet.c:93: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size
</EM><BR>
<P>You do not really say which line is 93 but from the context, most
<BR>
likely, you forgot to include headers with declarations of functions
<BR>
like malloc(), strchr() and the like.  If a declaration is missing
<BR>
then C, by default, assumes that such function returns 'int' and you
<BR>
really wanted a pointer here.  You see more such code and you start
<BR>
understand those who claim that any explicit casts are evil.
<BR>
<P>Note that the code was incorrect in a 32-bit case as well even if
<BR>
happened to work there due to lucky circumstances.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Any ideas?
</EM><BR>
<P>Compiling, especially on Alpha, without -Wall at miminum (there are
<BR>
warnings not covered by &quot;all&quot;) is a very unwise practice.  You would
<BR>
be clearly told what was missing otherwise.
<BR>
<P>A common real problem are assumptions that you may store pointer
<BR>
into 'int' and later recover from there the whole address intact.
<BR>
This may be not so easy to fix in a bigger code because of a network
<BR>
of interdependencies.  Also passing a pointer to function where
<BR>
int was expected, or vice-versa, and a prototype is missing leads to
<BR>
a &quot;barrel-of-laugh&quot; problems with a stack totally wacko.  You will
<BR>
be likely hit not immediately where the bug is but quite a bit later
<BR>
and results can be anything.
