<P><P>I've just digged out my old summary about this problem. It's not a missing
<BR>
terminating resistor (I remember that I tried that as well) but just a
<BR>
missing ground connection on the board which the said DEC cable apparently
<BR>
makes. So the solution is still cheaper. You need to solder a ground
<BR>
connection between RED GROUND and GREEN GROUND. The summary also mentions
<BR>
the P/N of the original DEC cable.

Hi,
<BR>
<P>I've solved the problem. In a nutshell: The green signal output on
<BR>
the ZLXp-E2 had no ground connection. Apparently the original Digital 
<BR>
cable BC13L-10 makes the ground connection internally by shortening the
<BR>
pins 6,7 and 8 (RED GROUND, GREEN GROUND and BLUE GROUND).
<BR>
<P>My solution was to solder a short bridge on the ZLXp-E2 between
<BR>
pins 6 (RED GROUND) and 7 (GREEN GROUND) of the SVGA connector.
<BR>
(If you want to do this without making the warranty void, you could
<BR>
as well solder this brige in a SVGA cable which lets you open the
<BR>
connector).
<BR>
<P>It works beautifully now and the display is sharp and clear without
<BR>
shadows. In fact is is even better as with the old PowerStorm 3D10 card :-)
<BR>
<P>In the case someone is interested, this is how I found this out: I've
<BR>
disconnected the green cable and suddently the display was clear and
<BR>
the shadow disappeared (the colors were wrong, of course). This lead me to
<BR>
the conclusion that the green signal line has an impendance mismatch. With
<BR>
the monitor disconnected, I've measured the resistance on the BNC
<BR>
connectors of RED and BLUE and found it to be 75 Ohm which it should have.
<BR>
The GREEN line, though, had a high impedance!
<BR>
<P>[signature snipped]
<BR>
<P>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<BR>
<P>Instead of soldering, I simply fabricated a tiny figure &quot;8&quot; from twist-tie
<BR>
wire and shorted together the relevant pins in my monitor cable plug.
