Hello!

<EM>&gt; It is very surprising to me to see messages posted on the topic of turning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the DEC 3000's into useful machines again ;).
</EM><BR>
<P>Just good, clean fun :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Can anyone tell me what happened to the old(er) effort led by Michael
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Engel?  When I actually managed to reach him earlier this year, he said
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that their group's efforts included a port to the DEC 3000 series as well.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; His port page can be found at <A HREF="http://decstation.unix-ag.org">http://decstation.unix-ag.org</A>  .
</EM><BR>
<P>I had contacted Michael Engel back in April, though I have not been in
<BR>
touch with him since.  At the time, he told me he had tried aboot and
<BR>
bootp on a couple of DEC 3000s and had run into trouble.  Certainly
<BR>
the DECstation work he's been a part of is highly relavent to the DEC
<BR>
3000 (turbochannel, same hardware).
<BR>
<P>And yes, indeed - their web site is *quite* useful.  Got copies of many
<BR>
docs there.  And the DECstation port is now entering the stable kernel
<BR>
- a bunch of it appeared for the first time in the kernel proper with
<BR>
2.2.11 (at least was in -pre).  Myself, I picked up a couple of
<BR>
DECstations just so I could give it a try - and it might be useful for
<BR>
a DEC 3000 port to &quot;see&quot; the turbochannel code &quot;in action&quot;, too.
<BR>
<P>The plan for me was to use as much of the DECstation code as possible;
<BR>
no need to repeat their hard work.  From what I've seen so far, that
<BR>
is clearly possible.
<BR>
<P>&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; If this latest effort is indeed different from Michael's team, good luck to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you.  I have been wholly unsuccessful in contacting anyone from Michael's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; team for more than one email.  Perhaps he is too busy with his port for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; likes of me :&gt; ...?
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks for the well-wishes :)  With the aboot problem licked (patch)
<BR>
and bootp working (a few magic entries in /etc/bootptab), it would be 
<BR>
a good idea to send Michael a mail.  Will do.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Let me also say that I have acquired a DECstation 3000 model 300LX, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will happily serve as a guinea pig for anything you have to try.  Due to an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unfortunate agreement I had to sign with my employer, I cannot participate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in actual DEVELOPMENT of the kernel for the DEC 3000, which I would dearly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like to help with since I have quite a bit of hardware programming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experience.  Therefore I must resign myself to the lowly position of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alpha-tester :(.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is too bad about your agreement, 'cuz I don't know diddly :)
<BR>
Well, maybe it isn't *that* bad, but I am still climbing the
<BR>
kernel/alpha learning curve(s).  I'll get there... (this list is
<BR>
proving to be a great resource).  
<BR>
<P>With any luck, you'll have something to try soon.  I hope.  At least
<BR>
it'll boot (it doesn't yet).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If anyone knows more about port efforts for the DEC 3000, by all means post
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to this list and explain.
</EM><BR>
<P>Here's one, and it'd be great if there were others!  For this effort,
<BR>
I've hooked up with a like-minded fellow, George Armhold.  And for
<BR>
anyone who's interested, we both have web pages, updated
<BR>
semi-regularly (hopefully more often in the future):

<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, we're not too far yet...  but I was honestly surprised
<BR>
at how far one can get with just some Makefile mods and a few hacks -
<BR>
the alpha maintainers deserve muchos kudos.  We'll get there - wish I
<BR>
could say when.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
Craig
<BR>
<P>P.S. In the meantime, if you wanted to put something besides DEC Unix on
<BR>
your 3000/300LX, you could try NetBSD.
