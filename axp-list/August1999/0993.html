hello all,
<BR>
I had input a bug report for the alpha, specifically redhat 5.2, asking 
<BR>
them to fix the 19 year offset problem. Yes, I know there are work arounds 
<BR>
but I'd like redhat to fix the problem. I had also input a bug report 
<BR>
saying that gdb doesn't work well with redhat linux. I received a reply 
<BR>
from redhat recently saying that there weren't any problems in these areas. 
<BR>
I know redhat didn't initially test their distribution on an alpha but on 
<BR>
(I believe) a  box emulating an  alpha.  I have moved my web server off my 
<BR>
alpha linux box and back onto my old, stable dec box so I don't know if 
<BR>
these are still problems. If these are still problems post back and I'll 
<BR>
resubmit my bug reports with your info.
<BR>
thanks
<BR>

<P>What the hell are you doing?  The do_clear_user routine is fine.

I disbelieve you are hanging on the same virtual address every time.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; i don't know what causes this behaviour:

<EM>&gt; -corrupt memory or cache? (it works fine under nt)

<P>NT doesn't turn on machine checks.  Linux does, but you should be

getting one if you have memory problems.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; -an error during memory mapping? (is this address possible?)
</EM><BR>
<P>That's a reasonable address for a user's shared library.
