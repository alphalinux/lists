<P>
The following question may be slightly off-topic, but since it *does*
<BR>
involve quite a few Linux/AXP systems, and since backup questions are
<BR>
being discussed anyway, here we go.
<BR>
<P>We have a setup with about 20 computers with a variety of Unix variants.
<BR>
These range from nearly 10 Linux/AXP systems, through a few Linux/x86
<BR>
machines, to several SGI workstations, one DEC AlphaServer, and even
<BR>
the odd OpenStep system.  OS's used are Linux/AXP and Linux/x86, from
<BR>
RedHat and Debian, with kernel versions from 2.0.xx to 2.2.xx, IRIX's
<BR>
6.3-6.5, OSF/1 3.2c, OpenStep 4.2.  Total disk space on these systems is
<BR>
currently on the order of 300 GB.  We expect this to double within the
<BR>
next 12-18 months, and the number of machines is also likely to go up
<BR>
substantially.
<BR>
<P>What I'm looking for is a unified backup solution for all these systems.
<BR>
In fact, our needs range all the way from mirroring through backup to
<BR>
archiving; but currently, the need for backup is the most urgent one.
<BR>
<P>So here's my QUESTION:  What kind of unified backup solution have people
<BR>
found to actually *work* for a setup like this?
<BR>
<P>I'm asking both about the types of hardware used (AIT, DLT, tape changers,
<BR>
RAID farms, CD-R, DVD-RAM, whatever...), as well the software tools
<BR>
(tar, cpio, dump, taper, ftape, afio, Amanda, KBackup, Burt, Arkeia,
<BR>
whatever...) that people are actually using and are happy with, both for
<BR>
backing up and *restoring*.
<BR>
<P>I'm by no means wed to tape technology (we've actually had some bad
<BR>
experiences with previous tape backups when it came to actually
<BR>
*restoring* data), but looking at what's available on the market, it seems
<BR>
that we're most likely to end up with a tape changer of some sort, hooked
<BR>
up to a dedicated machine -- hopefully a Linux box.  This system would
<BR>
back up all hard drives (as specified) of all other machines over the
<BR>
network.  Please note that that box need not necessarily be a Linux/*AXP*
<BR>
system; but we definitely have to be able to reliably back up our
<BR>
Linux/AXP machines to it.  I'm open to any interesting alternatives to
<BR>
tapes that people might report on.
<BR>
<P>We're also thinking about adding, or even entirely going to, RAID storage,
<BR>
or other NAS/SAN setups.  But these are obviously only good in case of
<BR>
disk crashes, not against user stupidity of the kind &quot;I accidentally
<BR>
deleted my entire project yesterday, can you please restore it?&quot; unless
<BR>
they're coupled with some kind of backup mechanism.
<BR>
<P>I'm looking for a solution that's easy to set up yet flexible, reliable,
<BR>
expandable in the future, affordable on the hardware side, and, if
<BR>
possible, free or low-cost on the software side.  Licence managers,
<BR>
per-client licenses and the like are quite unwelcome.  I'd prefer a
<BR>
solution that's also as little a security risk as possible; i.e., it
<BR>
should not require root privileges all over the place.
<BR>
<P>If the answer is not specific to Linux/AXP, (you can) send it to me
<BR>
privately.  If there's interest, I'll be happy to post a summary.
<BR>
<P>Thanks in advance for all responses,
<BR>
<P>Marc
