<EM>&gt; I suspect that the dynamics are all the same cyl/track/sector.  It  just get

<EM>&gt; complicated to have relocated (bad) sectors, and keeping up with 'track format/layout'
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd think there are available spare blocks on every track
<BR>
so if one did full track read/write, it's just a different
<BR>
position in the disk's cache for that track which would be

minimal overhead.

<P>That may work for general business data but the stuff I
<BR>
do doesn't compress. Learned that long ago on tape drives
<BR>
that have compression. In fact, trying to compress my type
<BR>
of data usually takes about 5-10% MORE space than if you don't.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;From the compression algorithm's view, the data looks random.
</EM><BR>
<P>Now, there are lossy, custom, compression algorithms (wavelet)
<BR>
that do work but it's lossy so no one would use it without
<BR>
indicating it was used or risk being sued for damaging someone's
<BR>
data. That's one of the things on my list of to-do's to get
<BR>
working eventually.
