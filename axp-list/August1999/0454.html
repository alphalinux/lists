Hello, Richard;
<BR>
<P>*Thank you* for your explicit explanation of what happens in
<BR>
paging_init()!  This is very useful to me, as I am clearly lacking
<BR>
much knowledge of how everything works.
<BR>

</EM><BR>
<P>Ummm... I'm note sure how to break it to you...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I had sprinkled some srm_printk (is this ok to do??) calls around (I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; working from a serial console), and just prior to paging_init() 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes.  You can't call srm_printk after that tbia above. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Ermm...  This has been the problem the whole time.  I had done this:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;srm_printk(&quot;Going to tbia()...\n&quot;);
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tbia();
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;srm_printk(&quot;returning from paging_init().\n&quot;);
<BR>
<P>(*embarrassment*).  Initially, I had srm_printk's everywhere, in order
<BR>
to get some feedback prior to console_init.
<BR>
<P>But now, after removing all the srm_printk() calls after that tbia(),
<BR>
no more DBLE MCHK.  THe boot attempt now hangs - and whenever I hit
<BR>
the halt button, no matter how long I wait, I get
<BR>
<P>?01 EXT HALT
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;PC= FFFFFC00.00318FCC PSL= 00000000.00000007
<BR>
<P>Now, I look into System.map
<BR>
<P>&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
fffffc0000318f60 T time_init
<BR>
fffffc00003193e0 T do_gettimeofday
<BR>
&lt;/snip&gt;
<BR>
<P>so I am sitting someplace in time_init!  Ok - I am back at it.
<BR>
<P>So just to make sure - there is no way to get feedback from the kernel
<BR>
between the tbia() in paging_init() and console_init()?  If so, I
<BR>
guess I just try to get past various hangs and machine checks as they
<BR>
come up by checking System.map to see where the problems were.  Is
<BR>
there a better way?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How much documentation are you working with here?  Or are you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just winging it?  I know NetBSD works on the 3000; you might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compare our vm startup code with theirs.
</EM><BR>
<P>here's most of the docs I have
<BR>
<P>* Alpha Architecture Reference Manual (1st edition)
<BR>
* DEC 3000 300/400/500/600/700/800/900 AXP Models System Programmer's Manual
<BR>
* David Rusling's &quot;The Linux Kernel&quot;
<BR>
* All the Turbochannel docs I could find...
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* Turbochannel Hardware Specification
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* Turbochannel Firmware Specification
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* Turbochannel System Parameters
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* Turbochannel Interface ASIC Functional Specification
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* PMAG-BA Turbochannel Color Framebuffer Functional Specification
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* PMAD-AA Turbochannel Ethernet Module Functional Specification
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* PMAZ-AA Turbochannel SCSI Module Functional Specification
<BR>
<P>as well as the docs for the Zilog serial communications port, the
<BR>
NCR 53c94 SCSI controller, the AMD 7990 Lance ethernet, and the AMD
<BR>
79C30A for the ISDN.
<BR>
<P>I also have some docs on the more recent Alpha hardware to help see
<BR>
how the already-working code works...
<BR>
<P>I read through a bunch of it, and it is just *a lot*...  The DEC 3000
<BR>
300/400/500/600/700/800/900 AXP Models System Programmer's Manual
<BR>
(that's a mounthful) seems choked with information - I'm sure I'll be
<BR>
relying on it soon.
<BR>
<P>I've browsed a bit through the NetBSD alpha sources - funny, should
<BR>
have done that sooner, though I probably would've made the same
<BR>
mistake anyway (they have a comment near their tbia call which says
<BR>
&quot;NO OUTPUT ALLOWED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE&quot;).  I am sure their sources
<BR>
will be *very* useful, too, and not just for the vm code.
<BR>
<P>Of course, if anyone has docs which may be useful and I've not listed,
<BR>
I'd love to hear about them. 
<BR>
<P>So far, though, I haven't done too much.  I've added &quot;pelican&quot; and
<BR>
&quot;flamingo&quot; machine vectors, made the makefile and config.in mods,
<BR>
etc., and imported some of the turbochannel stuff from the Decstation
<BR>
port.  A lot of stuff is just dummied out in what I have done, 'cuz
<BR>
I'm not sure what to put there yet (PCI stuff, for example).
<BR>
<P>Many Thanks,
<BR>
Craig
