<P>
I have been trying for several weeks now to get Linux installed
<BR>
on a Jensen and have lots of experience with other Alpha's. :-(
<BR>
Still no luck.
<BR>
<P>You'll need a video card that can be recognized by the SRM
<BR>
firmware. The following S3-based ISA/EISA cards are absolutely 
<BR>
known to work with the S3 XFree86 server.

<P>If you are only interested in text you can also add the Compaq
<BR>
QVision card. No X server but at least the system will be usable.
<BR>
Rumor has it that some very old 8-bit ISA cards are also recognized
<BR>
though probably not usable under X.
<BR>
<P>If you plug a terminal into serial port 1 and disconnect your
<BR>
keyboard you can at least get to the firmware with an unrecognized
<BR>
card.
<BR>
<P>The latest XFree86 (4.0) dumped the S3 server and moved the sparse
<BR>
bus access code into a more generic source area under the SVGA 
<BR>
server. So it looks like SVGA card (not just S3) that can be 
<BR>
recognized by SRM might work. It's no longer hardcoded to work with 
<BR>
just S3 chipsets.
<BR>
<P>Look at the docs on www.alphalinux.org for installation instructions.
<BR>
They are *supposed* to work. I have had no luck with that method or
<BR>
others I've tried. If you get a good install please let me know how
<BR>
you did it.

Subject: DECpc -video card -installation
<BR>
<P><P>To Whom It May Concern,
<BR>
<P>I am a student at the university of california riverside and am
<BR>
currently working at the mirage research lab. We have eight DECpc AXP
<BR>
150's (jensen) that are currently running OSF/1. We would like to
<BR>
install RedHat Linux 6.0 on these machines. The problem is that i have
<BR>
heard that Xwindow will not run on these machines due to a video card
<BR>
conflict. Is this true? If so, are there any work arounds? What video
<BR>
cards will work with xwindow and where can they be obtained? Also, i
<BR>
understand that the installation process is quite difficult on these
<BR>
machines, being only a first year student, i will need all the help i
<BR>
can get. Do you know of any resources that might help me out?
<BR>
<P>Sorry to have overwhelmed you with questions.
<BR>
<P>Any help you could offer would greatly be appreciated.
<BR>
Thanks,
<BR>
jas
