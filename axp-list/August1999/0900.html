Hi,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a howto anywhere on how to make your program use the
<BR>
32bit only trick when compiling/linking on the Alpha?  I can think of a
<BR>
number of places where this trick would work out pretty well, games
<BR>
especially.  Given the average life of a game and the average size of one,
<BR>
no games written for the next year or two will really need more than 2 Gig
<BR>
of RAM.  After that as life moves more 64bit, people should be writing
<BR>
cleaner code.  For that reason, it would be nice to make a howto on how to
<BR>
write/compile/link 32bit programs (Which just means that all pointers will
<BR>
fit in 32 bits unless otherwise requested, right?) so that places,
<BR>
especially like Loki, can have an easier time of porting short-lived
<BR>
programs to the Alpha.  After all, a game that can run in less than 2 Gig
<BR>
is never going to need more than that, revisions are so rare and code gets
<BR>
outdated so quickly in games that this strikes me like a good compromise.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: I'm not suggested that much past games gets written in this
<BR>
manner, but games programmers tend not to be very good at generating clean
<BR>
code (with some notable exceptions), so it seems like a reasonable
<BR>
compromise for the time being.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there isn't a howto, would someone be kind enough to outline
<BR>
the steps for me, and I'll write one up?  Thanks a lot.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Chris
