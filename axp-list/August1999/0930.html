<P>Depends on what you're trying to do. If you're booting with SRM and
<BR>
you want to get the nic card to be recognized from there.. good
<BR>
luck. I haven't found much in the way of cards that work with SRM. I
<BR>
did find an old SMC 9332DST that works reasonably well, but newer
<BR>
versions of the 21140 chipset just don't fly. Incidentally, if anyone
<BR>
knows of any other nics that work from SRM, I'd like to hear about it.
<BR>
<P>If you don't care about the console recognizing your nic, I've found
<BR>
that the boomerang 3com cards (3c905?!) worked fairly well.
