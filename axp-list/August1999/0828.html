<P>
I heard that the SRM actually uses 2.8MB or so of ram that is not
<BR>
reclaimed by the system.  (I read that in the HOWTO's just today
<BR>
somewhere).
<BR>
<P>I'm not sure why 4.4MB is missing, but that should explain part of it.
<BR>
<P>I read that when using MILO instead of SRM, you don't waste nearly that
<BR>
much memory.
<BR>
<P>[If i'm nuts, someone pipe in here.. this is just what I learned today in
<BR>
my own meanderings through the FAQ and HOWTO's]
