<P>Hey, we're all nice here, now aren't we? ;)

<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've got (finished today) RedHat 6.0 (with updates) running on a 4100
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 5/466 with 512M RAM and 4 4.3G disks.  The boot up command looks like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boot dkb0 -file vmlinux -flags &quot;root=/dev/sda1&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and it seems to work great - however, i've seen some crashes back to the P
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prompt during boot up...  They seem to happen after the kernel loads,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; between the &quot;Starting CROND&quot; and &quot;Starting INET&quot; rc scripts....
</EM><BR>
<P>Humm...wierd.  Could you send me/us a full log of the boot sequence?  Not to
<BR>
be a weenie, but I can't remember when I last saw a fully clean boot on my
<BR>
rawhide...&lt;smirk&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Anyone have any ideas - i'd like to set up the bootdev_dev, boot_osflags
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and boot_file to do the work for me - but it does not seem to work...
</EM><BR>
<P>What do you mean by &quot;does not seem to work&quot;?  Just that it doesn't get any
<BR>
better, or that none of the settings seem to hold?  Firstly, as I so often
<BR>
recommend, I'd upgrade the firmware to 5.4 - you can find it on the Compaq
<BR>
web site (it's still under www.digital.com IIRC).  Let me know if you can't
<BR>
find it - I'll dig up my pointer.  Second, asking a stupid question:  you are
<BR>
doing it as follows, right?
<BR>
<P>P00&gt;&gt;&gt; set boot_file vmlinux
<BR>
P00&gt;&gt;&gt; set boot_osflags root=/dev/sda1
<BR>
P00&gt;&gt;&gt; set bootdef_dev dkb0
<BR>
<P>If you are, and it still doesn't take it, there are some larger problems
<BR>
here...but I'd rather not worry about that as it's hopefully not the case.
<BR>
Lemme know - I'm always interested in rawhide-related stuff ;)
