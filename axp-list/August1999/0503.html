<EM>&gt; What - since when did that get decided?
</EM><BR>
<P>A little quip from infoworld:
<BR>
Compaq dumps Windows NT on Alpha
<BR>
<P><P>In a stunning move, Compaq has laid off more than 100 people in labs in
<BR>
Redmond, Wash., who worked exclusively on porting Windows NT to the Alpha
<BR>
platform. The company has effectively discontinued support of Microsoft's
<BR>
operating system on Alpha.
<BR>
<P>So is compaq/API going to concentrate fully on alphalinux, and if so how
<BR>
soon can we expect a good browser and productivity platform, or atleast
<BR>
emulation that will let us run the intel ones good enough, though the
<BR>
thoughts of star office in emulation are almost sickening, its slow enough
<BR>
on its native platform.
<BR>
On that note, I know not many use the alpha for everyday stuff, but it would
<BR>
be nice to be able to, especially if API and compaq want to sell more of
<BR>
them, so is there any posibility KOffice will compile on the alpha? I am
<BR>
thinking about giving it a try later today or tomarrow. This leads to
<BR>
another question, are there any real productivity apps for the alpha or are
<BR>
we mostly stuck to the realm of the scientific and hand tweaked apps.
