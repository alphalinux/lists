<P>
I got my 'free' Multia this week and got a copy of RH6.0 for alpha in an
<BR>
attempt to get this, my first non-Intel system running. I have run into
<BR>
some unexpected problems, and those may be because of my naivity or
<BR>
ignorance of what I was getting myself into, but I am sure I am not the
<BR>
only one and I hope this is the right place to ask questions about it. 
<BR>
I have just joined this list, but didn't see any mention of an FAQ, so
<BR>
if there is any (apart from the normal HOWTOs) I would like to know.
<BR>
<P>I have been using Linux since the SLS (pre-Slackware) distribution and
<BR>
some 0.99 kernel so I may be a newbie to Alpha, but not in general :-)
<BR>
<P>I got my UDB from eBiz (www.thelinuxstore.com) as you may have guessed
<BR>
and I ordered it to come with 32MB RAM and an IDE HD, and I got the
<BR>
FD from Starship Computer. As I have a PS/2 keyboard and mouse and a
<BR>
SVGA capable monitor I thought everything would be fairly easy at least
<BR>
with the hardware, but it doesn't seem to be.
<BR>
<P>1. I am yet not able to find an IDE cable to connect the HD (2.5&quot; Seagate
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ST91685AG), which seems to be very special as it needs a 44pin 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;female-female cable that also carries the power-supply to connect to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the motherboard. Unfortunately, eBiz didn't have such a cable and I 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;didn't know it would be such a pain to find. The HD doesn't have the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;normal power-supply connector which makes it impossible to fiddle with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;44pin -&gt; 40pin -&gt; 44pin adapters and such. I don't even know where to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get the connectors as spareparts because all the shops I went to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;almost balked when I mentioned something that didn't include the two
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;letters &quot;P&quot; and &quot;C&quot;.
<BR>
<P>If you have a clue as to what to do here I would really appreciate it.
<BR>
<P>I was able to start up the boot process with the three floppy disks
<BR>
described and I intend to install by NFS mounting the CDROM from one of
<BR>
my other machines. If you know of any quirks or something I should be
<BR>
careful about, please don't hesitate to tell me. Even RH installation
<BR>
is a first as I have always used Slackware, and I can't imagine a
<BR>
distribution easier and more flexible ;-)
<BR>
<P>Thank you very much,
<BR>
<P>Peter
