Having found that I had major file system corruruption that caused all
<BR>
sorts of weird scsi errors I proceeded to wipe everything out and start
<BR>
from scratch. The scsi card is a ncr53c895 (datastorm 32+) and I have
<BR>
two scsi drives, the system is a 164LX. I low level formated and
<BR>
verified both disks and found nothing physicaly wrong with them. I then
<BR>
proceeded to install RH 6.0. I booted milo from a floppy and got into
<BR>
the install. I set up my partitons and go further into the install but
<BR>
I'm held back by the installer saying I have no swap partitons defined. 
<BR>
<P>I then tried to use fdisk and a simple setup. 127MB swap and the rest /.
<BR>
I tagged fs label on each parititon wrote the partition table to the
<BR>
disks and then exited fdisk. The installer then wanted to reboot the
<BR>
system so I did and when it came time to setup  the file systems the fs
<BR>
they claimed having was a number (0x6). I then deleted then and created
<BR>
new paritions and tried to continue but was confronted with the same
<BR>
error.
<BR>
<P>Now frustrated I tried to install NT on the system (Please forgive me).
<BR>
I did the express parition setup (which worked) and tried to install NT
<BR>
only for the kernel to crash with a INACESSABLE_BOOT_DEVICE aka &quot;I don't
<BR>
recognize your scsi controller&quot;. After this happened i switch my bios
<BR>
over to SRM 5.4 and tried to install Alpha/NetBSD and Alpha/FreeBSD.
<BR>
Both failed with an error creating the filesystem. 
<BR>
<P>During this time I had one U2W drive connected setup on id 2 with an
<BR>
active terminator. My scsi card only offers auto termination, it won't
<BR>
let me set it otherwise. So techniclly my scsi setup is correct.
<BR>
<P>So I've wiped the slate clean and now I'm unable to install any OS on my
<BR>
Alpha. All suggestions and ideas are greatly appreciated. 
<BR>
