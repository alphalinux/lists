<EM>&gt; So is compaq/API going to concentrate fully on alphalinux, and if so how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; soon can we expect a good browser and productivity platform, or atleast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; emulation that will let us run the intel ones good enough, though the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thoughts of star office in emulation are almost sickening, its slow enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on its native platform.
</EM><BR>
<P>Web broswers on AlphaLinux include amaya, grail, MMM, Lynx, KFM from
<BR>
KDE, and mozilla. Once NS gets to release 5.0 you should  see an
<BR>
official AlphaLinux version. It compiles on Alpha already but it's 
<BR>
buggy since it's still under heavy development. Also if you has access
<BR>
to Tru64 libraries you can run the Tru64 version of Netscape on
<BR>
AlphaLinux and most any other program like Adobe Acrobat Reader. On RH
<BR>
5.0-5.2 you can run NS through em86. There is an updated version of em86
<BR>
to work with glibc-2.1 though it isn't there quite yet. 
<BR>
<P>Productivity on AlphaLinux includes the Applixware Office Suite,
<BR>
Koffice, KDE, and Gnome. BTW most of the developement of KDE is done on
<BR>
Alphas.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; On that note, I know not many use the alpha for everyday stuff, but it would
</EM><BR>
<P>Well I do :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; be nice to be able to, especially if API and compaq want to sell more of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them, so is there any posibility KOffice will compile on the alpha? I am
</EM><BR>
<P>See above.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; thinking about giving it a try later today or tomarrow. This leads to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; another question, are there any real productivity apps for the alpha or are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we mostly stuck to the realm of the scientific and hand tweaked apps.
</EM><BR>
<P>See above. Also since the source code for most apps are available
<BR>
getting it to work on Alpha usally no more difficult that make and make
<BR>
install.
