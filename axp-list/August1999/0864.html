<P>
hey all.  thanks for the advice on ftp servers, etc.  alas, the 5.2
<BR>
installer won't work with my networking anymore.  automatic domain/host
<BR>
lookup fails, and then when i enter the values, it won't connect to an ftp
<BR>
server.  if i give it the server's name, it says can't lookup server's
<BR>
name, and if i give it the ip, it just says unable to log into server.
<BR>
there's nothing wrong with my connection or my name server, either.  so i
<BR>
decided to try a cd i burned on someone else's machine, which i think
<BR>
should work. milo likes my cd
<BR>
drive fine and the installer seems to like it, too, in the beginning.
<BR>
checking in the 3rd virtual terminal (which is where i assume the data for
<BR>
the install log file is being generated), it does stuff like mount scd0 on
<BR>
/tmp/rhimage and remove /tmp/scd0, but then when it enters the 'find
<BR>
installation files' stage, when the terminal says 'making symlink from
<BR>
/tmp/rhimage to image' it fails, generating this error in the main install
<BR>
screen: 'error opening header file: no such file or directory.'
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is this a problem with my cd, or my drive, or the installer?  has
<BR>
anyone seen this before?  i should mention that the boot and ramdisks i'm
<BR>
using are the same ones i used to install rh 5.2 more than a year ago.
<BR>
they boot up fine, but could they somehow be the problem?  i'm getting
<BR>
really stuck here.
<BR>
thanks so much.
<BR>
<P>justin
