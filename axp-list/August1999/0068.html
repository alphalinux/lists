<P>
I have AlphaServer 2100 5/250 with cirrus GD5430.
<BR>
<P>I just installed RHL6.0 and everything is setup but the X.
<BR>
<P>And since I cannot get it to work with X, today I thought
<BR>
I want to try something different, which is changing the
<BR>
video card. I did open the box, took off the video card..
<BR>
replace it, and then i also took off the CPU board and
<BR>
memory board just for curiosity. Then i put back everything,
<BR>
and now.. it won't run anymore. (I put back everything
<BR>
to the place where they were before)
<BR>
<P>Infact, it won't even do anything when I push the power
<BR>
button. It seems like the power supply had died, but if I
<BR>
check the back, the power supply AC light is ON!
<BR>
But again, if I press the power on button, nothing happened.
<BR>
Not even a FAN or HD spinning.. nothing.
<BR>
<P>I hope I did not damage the machine. Hey, any ideas?
<BR>
I'm really desperate now.. 
<BR>
I finally got an alpha machine, and it died after a week. =(
<BR>
*arrrgghh*
<BR>
<P>Yudi.
