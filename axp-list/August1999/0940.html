Yeah, I love the tulip cards... on Intel, they were
<BR>
the only cards that performed well in promisc mode.
<BR>
However, I do recall reading somewhere that the tulip
<BR>
cards misalign the IP bytes... and this is a
<BR>
performance hinderance on Alpha...
<BR>
<P>I actually love the tulip cards so much that I stock
<BR>
up on them whenever I can find them.. as they are no
<BR>
longer produced, or so it seems.
<BR>
<P>My experiences with the 3Com905TX has been poor. On
<BR>
intel/Linux, they were poor performers under high
<BR>
traffic, especially in promisc mode. On Alpha/Linux, I
<BR>
kept getting packet errors at about 40% of the time.
<BR>
The 3COM cards seem to work really well if you use
<BR>
NT... so perhaps it's just a driver issue? (I'm not
<BR>
qualified to really say..)
<BR>
<P>D.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Must be something specific to the Kingston card.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I use several brands of 2114x based cards plus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; built-in's and they all work well, as long as you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use the latest tulip.c from Becker's site.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Netgear FA310TX (old ones, the new ones use a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different chip)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Netgear new cards are supposed to work. I don't have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though. Might pick one up and try it. They have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; driver on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their site but I don't know if it's Intel only or??
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 21143's built into XP1000/DS10's.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linksys Etherfast 100-TX (21140)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SVEC (21142 or 21143, can't remember)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also have a D-Link 530tx, a via-rhine card but had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trouble
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with it initially so it's not installed in anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at the
</EM><BR>
