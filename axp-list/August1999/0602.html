<EM>&gt; Hi,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Just thought I would ask the group... Where have you had best pricing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and which platform do you find best &quot;bang for the buck&quot; when looking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for a good desktop alpha?  I guess I am looking for a good vendor -- best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pricing, and a good reputation.  Any recommendations would be greatly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appreciated.  I am looking to purchase between 6-12 systems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>That would depend on your price range, and how much
<BR>
you want state of the art performance. I have a PC164, 
<BR>
PC164LX, and XP1000. I'd go for the XP1000 over the
<BR>
first two any day. It's a bit pricey though and if you
<BR>
want good bang for the buck, a DS10 might be what you're
<BR>
looking for. Again, pricing is an issue. An XP1000 goes
<BR>
for $7000-8000. A DS10 is $3000-4000. If you're not 
<BR>
interested in paying for state of the art, then consider
<BR>
a PC164SX, or a PC164LX. They should be quite a bit cheaper
<BR>
than the first two since they are a generation back from
<BR>
the DS10/XP1000. If you're thinking low buck, then those
<BR>
cheap Multias might be worthwhile but they sound pretty
<BR>
labor intensive to get going. Don't own one but just from
<BR>
the comments on the list, they seem problematic.
<BR>
<P>Just my $.02.
