<EM>&gt; I had something similar happen once... turned out the CPU fan was the

Thanks for all people that responded...

I finally resolved it.. it was a stupid thing... it turn out that on the DC
<BR>
switch (power button) there is another switch that will enable/disable the
<BR>
power button. And that switch is on if the case is closed. There is this
<BR>
little metal that sticks out and suppose to enable this switch, and all I
<BR>
have to do is tighten the screw really tight until i hear the click on the
<BR>
switch, then the power button will be enabled. 
<BR>
<P>At least I learn something now...
<BR>
<P>Again, thanks for all the people who responded, and in pronto too.
<BR>
This is a cool mail-list.
