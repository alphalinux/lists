<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm looking at installing some new disk on my XP1000.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It seems Seagate now make a 50GB U2W LVD disk drive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone know if this will give Alpha Linux heartburn??
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; We are testing 2 of them Barracudas.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Great. Let me know what you find. I'll probably order a couple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; today.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, 50GB Barracuda is bit cooler than Atlas 10k 36GB
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I should have 2 on my doorstep in the morning.
<BR>
Plan on putting them in a separate case.
<BR>
<P>The Atlas 10K is advertised as the fastest disk around
<BR>
so I would expect it to run hot. Probably not as hot
<BR>
as my Micropolis 9GB drives. They're so hot I can't
<BR>
keep my hand on them but they continue to run...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The datastorm arrived this morning and the Qlogic and a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Tekram yesterday. I'm currently working on a large problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; so it will be tomorrow before I can take the XP1000 down.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Have you tested Intraserver cards? They seems very nice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Maurice recommends them highly at Hard Data. I don't
<BR>
happen to have one so I can't say much one way or the
<BR>
other. I did look and they sell two models, one for
<BR>
NT and another for Tru64. The Tru64 model was a bit
<BR>
expensive at over $300. I can get a real Compaq part
<BR>
for less than that. The NT part was $150 or so. 
<BR>
<P>I'm collecting info on what's compatible in order
<BR>
to decide how to configure some DS10's. Particularly,
<BR>
what SCSI cards work and what video works. I suspect if
<BR>
a card works on my XP1000, it will work in the DS10. 
<BR>
If someone knows otherwise, please let me know.
