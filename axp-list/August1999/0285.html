<P>
Uncle George asks:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Is there a way to change a physical block size to 1K?
</EM><BR>
<P>SCSI protocol allows for that (you send required SCSI commands to
<BR>
a disk) and older hardware actually **was** implementing that.
<BR>
I have still an old WREN, used on NeXT, which is re-formatted that
<BR>
way because this actually increased both disk performance and its
<BR>
capacity (less sector gap overhead).
<BR>
<P>As MS-Windows cannot make any use of that facility manufacturers
<BR>
**removed** that option from their disks; i.e. you can still send those
<BR>
commands to your hard drive but they have no effect. The fact that other
<BR>
OSes are possibly smarter was immaterial.  I am not aware of any
<BR>
hardware which still retains this capability but maybe there is
<BR>
somewhere some.
<BR>
<P>I have no idea if (E)IDE specs allow physical block changes.  I would be
<BR>
quite surprised.
