<EM>&gt; The ratio of overhead ( crc, leadin/training bytes, and sector/track numbering

<P>The newer drives use something called &quot;ID-less sectors&quot; so I
<BR>
don't think the overhead per block is as high now. I did look

at the unformatted capacity of the Seagate 50GB drive. It's
<BR>
around 60GB. That would be for control overhead and bad block
<BR>
relocation I suppose.

<P><EM>&gt; so u think that whatever really happens inside a disk drive now-a-days does

<EM>&gt; not  need to match what a person thinks should be happening inside. ?

<P>Yes. Whole track I/O has been around in mainframes for at
<BR>
least 10 years so it's just trickling down from the big
<BR>
iron. As long as it creates the same end result, the 
<BR>
application shouldn't see any difference. It allows the
<BR>
drive to combine writes (assuming you turn on write buffering)
<BR>
and pre-read data so in general it helps performance.
