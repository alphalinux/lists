<P>
Now, Linux gets its own credit card
<BR>

<BR>
Give Linux fans a little credit.
<BR>
<P>Or at least, give them a credit card.
<BR>
<P>That's the plan of Benjamin Cox, founder of the Linux Fund, who will offer
<BR>
people credit cards emblazoned with the Linux penguin mascot.
<BR>
<P>Although he hopes to make a comfortable living from the project, Cox isn't
<BR>
just trying to make a quick buck. The goal of the non-profit initiative is
<BR>
to channel proceeds toward worthy open-source development projects.
<BR>
<P>Cox is the latest of a breed of entrepreneurs who sees the opportunity to
<BR>
find a little money in the Linux phenomenon. And though his project is
<BR>
comparatively small, some big names are involved as well--such as venture
<BR>
capital firms Benchmark, Sequoia, and Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers.
<BR>
<P>Cox has he's signed a deal for the cards through MBNA, a company that
<BR>
provides credit cards tailored to appeal to fans of everything from the
<BR>
National Football League to Star Trek. Under the deal, a percentage of each
<BR>
charge made on the credit card with the credit card is diverted into the
<BR>
Linux Fund.
<BR>
<P>The organization recently added an online application to his site and signed
<BR>
up more than 400 interested people at the LinuxWorld Conference and Expo
<BR>
earlier this month, he said. If he can sign up 100,000 people, that would
<BR>
provide an estimated $2 million a year to fund development projects and
<BR>
scholarships, he said.
<BR>
<P>The development projects will be selected by a board of developers familiar
<BR>
with the software, said Mark Willey, a member of the board. Projects will be
<BR>
peer reviewed, he added.
<BR>
<P>Cox's Linux Fund project shouldn't be confused with another Linux Fund,
<BR>
which aims to invest money in Linux companies.
<BR>
<P>VC interest in Linux
<BR>
Deeper pockets have become interested in Linux and other open-source
<BR>
projects recently. Benchmark Capital, a noted Silicon Valley firm that
<BR>
typically provides funding to projects just getting off the ground, is one
<BR>
such outfit.
<BR>
<P>Kevin Harvey, the Benchmark partner who deals with open-source projects,
<BR>
said he considers his firm the leading venture capital firm in terms of
<BR>
backing open-source projects--the efforts such as Linux where programmers
<BR>
may freely share the software's original programming instructions.
<BR>
<P>Benchmark benefited from Red Hat's initial public offering and has taken a
<BR>
stake in Collab.net, whose core project is the SourceXchange site where
<BR>
programmers can bid for open-source projects. Other efforts are in the
<BR>
pipeline, he added.
<BR>
<P>Harvey said SourceXchange will begin with less glamorous projects, such as
<BR>
those a company wants to outsource instead devote its own programmers to.
<BR>
But later, he expects it to house many more serious efforts. Companies will
<BR>
be able to save money hiring programming talent, and programmers will be
<BR>
able to work from all over the world.
<BR>
<P>&quot;There's talent all over the world that would love to be able to work and
<BR>
live where they want to and find their clients over the Internet,&quot; Harvey
<BR>
said.
