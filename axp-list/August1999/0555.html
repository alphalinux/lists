I got one of those babies, too so I'll try :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Hi everybody. I'm new to alphas, but not linux. I just got one of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;multias from linuxstore.com, and I'm having a terrible time getting things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;setup. I can't get the thing to boot at all. I'm hoping this lists members
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;might be of some help. I put a 2G SCSI disk in it, got what I was told is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;parity memory SIMMS, and a dec floppy drive for it. I see no power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;connector for the floppy drive. I connected it via the tape; is that all?
</EM><BR>
Yes, that is all and that works for me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Where does the floppy drive get its power? Also, how can I tell, by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;looking at the sticks, whether or not I have &quot;true parity&quot; memory? Would
</EM><BR>
If there are 9 ICs on it it is parity (8bit + parity bit).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;it be easier to setup an IDE drive? I don't see how the 2.5&quot; laptop IDE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;drives would get power unless it is from the cable on the motherboard.
</EM><BR>
And that is what it does. That is the exact reason it uses a 44pin IDE cable
<BR>
instead of the regular 40pin cable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;When I try to boot this thing, I can hear the SCSI drive crank once, then 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nothing happens. My monitor appears to be receiving no signal from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;multia video port - the light on the monitor goes orange from green. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;floppy drive doesn't appear to be accessed at all. Where do I start my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;troubleshooting?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
What distribution do you use? RedHat 5.2, 6.0? How do you attempt to boot it?
<BR>
There are instructions on www.thelinuxstore.com regarding how to deal with
<BR>
booting and setting up the Multia with RH5.2. That info helped me.
<BR>
<P>It is a three floppy process, ie. a MILO floppy, a boot floppy and a root
<BR>
floppy, but before you even attempt that you of course needs a signal on your
<BR>
monitor :-)
<BR>
<P>The first monitor I attempted to use wasn't able to sync on the signal that
<BR>
came out (I think it was 1280x1152, but I could be wrong), but then I got a
<BR>
faster one and then I got a signal. Typing &quot;arc &lt;enter&gt;&quot; at the &gt;&gt;&gt; prompt
<BR>
got me started with what looks like a textscreen and from there you must set
<BR>
up the NVRAM to contain info about how to boot from the floppy, and that is
<BR>
described in one of the documents on www.thelinuxstore.com.
<BR>
<P>I hope this helped, and you may return if/when you need more info :-)
<BR>
<P>Peter
