<EM>&gt; I've seen this exact same behavior on my LX with a ncr53c895. It was the

<P>Humm. I've got 3 U2W's and an UW on the card. They
<BR>
work fine on 2.2.3 so I kind of doubt it's the HD's.
<BR>
<P>Also, note the &lt;0,*&gt; part of the message. That's the
<BR>
controller, not a drive.

<P>ncr53c895-0: command processing resumed

ncr53c895-0-&lt;0,*&gt;: WIDE SCSI (16 bit) enabled.

ncr53c895-0-&lt;0,*&gt;: FAST-20 WIDE SCSI 40.0 MB/s (50 ns, offset 15)

<P>I have seen it complain about a specific drive
<BR>
but the notation above changes and shows the scsi id
<BR>
of the drive. That happens occasionally when a drive
<BR>
doesn't spin up on it's own. I just power the disk
<BR>
off and back on to get it spinning.

<P>I came to this solution after booting with &quot;ncr53c8xx=verb:2&quot;
<BR>
on my 2.2.3 kernel and seeing how it computed the number of
<BR>
msec's it used that ALWAYS worked with that kernel. If it
<BR>
helps, I tried this on a couple different kernels and it
<BR>
seems to behave OK. (2.2.5 and 2.2.11)
<BR>
<P>Basically, the routine kept getting 80mhz and it would not
<BR>
work. Of course, this may be due to my mixing U2W/UW drives
<BR>
but the 53c895 with transceiver is supposed to handle that
<BR>
correctly. Also, I'm using a SE active terminator on both
<BR>
sides of the bus so it really can't run U2W LVD. So, it's 
<BR>
possible the 895 and U2W disks are attempting to negotiate
<BR>
a 80MB/sec handshake and since the terminator doesn't support
<BR>
it, it's hanging. For, now, I'll leave it in. When I get a
<BR>
U2W LVD terminator, I'll try that but the same problem occurs
<BR>
on a 53c875 so I'm not hopeful that's the problem.
<BR>
<P>As usual, YMMV.
<BR>
<P>System is still running at the moment with this change but
<BR>
I won't be stressing it until latter today.
