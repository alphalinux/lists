&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to everyone who gave me advice on this problem...  Silly me,
<BR>
I never realized I had to recompile the kernel without support for the
<BR>
TGA frame buffer...  Apparently there was some kind of conflict b/w the
<BR>
frame buffer and the Mach64 video card...
<BR>
<P>Adam Kirchhoff
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I'm wondering if anyone has managed to get Linux to boot on a UDB/Multia
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with a video card installed in the one PCI slot?  Everything else seems to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work fine, but I'd like the option of higher color depths than I can get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the TGA Server.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So far I've attempted two cards: an S3 864 and an ATI Mach64 card...  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; x86 emulator initializes the cards correctly (using ARC, rather than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Milo code) but, each time, as the kernel is booting, I get an error
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concerning kernel paging requests...  (Both cards worked under x86 Linux).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't have the error from the S3 card in front of me, but, with the Mach
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; card, this is (at least part of) what I get:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 00000000000b9720
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; swapper(1): Oops 0
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pc = []     ra = [    ps = 0000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; r0  = fffffc000052b120  r1=0000000000000fa0   r2 = 0000000000000001
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; r3  = 00000000000b8aa0  r4 = 0000000007200000  r5 = 0000000000000014
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This starts right after the line:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Starting kswapd v1.5
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Please bear in mind that this figures are handwritten down, written down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; after my last attempt to boot with the Mach64 card, so all the digits may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not be exactly right).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; According to a number of faq's, the S3 card should be supported by XFree86's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; S3 server for Alpha Linux, but I'm not sure about the Mach64 card.  Either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way, it seems pretty irrelevant at this point since it the system won't even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boot with either card.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've attempted to boot off an already installed Linux system (which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obviously boots when I don't have either card in) and off the boot floppy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In both cases, I get the error...  Any help would be appreciated...  Thanks.
