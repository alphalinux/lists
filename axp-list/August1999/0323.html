<EM>&gt; Hey, just thought I'd let you know that this succeeds in fully blowing up my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rawhide.  Right after printing something akin to &quot;Scanning PCI hardware&quot;, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get an endless stream of mcpcia machine checks, all with a fill syndrome of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2360.  I'm going to try to dig up my rawhide programmers manual to see what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this means.  I guess it could be hardware, but I kinda doubt it as I'd had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.2.10+patches running since yesterday morning cleanly.  The system is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supposed to be returned to use in its &quot;assigned&quot; role sometime soon (dragging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my feet a bit...;) so soon you won't have me darkening your doorstep with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these delightful notes.  At least, until I find another rawhide ;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, well you can never mind that - it spit up those errors for about 20
<BR>
minutes, and seeing as I'm on a serial line from a different room, I just let it
<BR>
choke.  At some point, it quit barking and finished booting.  Now I've just got
<BR>
to figure out why it won't finish creating a data connection across the tulip
<BR>
card - I get the following:
<BR>
<P>[root@rengbox seti1]# telnet av8r
<BR>
Trying 16.140.16.103...
<BR>
Connected to av8r.zk3.dec.com.
<BR>
Escape character is '^]'.
<BR>
<P>And then nothing.  If I login from another system, I can see the following:
<BR>
<P>[root@rengbox frival]# netstat -a|grep av8r
<BR>
tcp        0     25 rengbox.zk3.dec.co:1026 av8r.zk3.dec.com:telnet FIN_WAIT1
<BR>
tcp        0     24 rengbox.zk3.dec.co:1027 av8r.zk3.dec.com:telnet ESTABLISHED
<BR>
tcp        0      0 rengbox.zk3.dec.co:auth av8r.zk3.dec.com:1788   SYN_RECV
<BR>
<P>Note that logging in from and to a system over the DEFPA (fddi) network works
<BR>
fine.  Strange....
