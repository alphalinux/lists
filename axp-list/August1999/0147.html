<EM>&gt; &gt; Could be.. but I think I found the problem. One of the simm slots
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in bank 1 seems to be flaky, the XLT runs fine again now with only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bank 0 filled. When I put some simms into bank 1, the trouble starts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; all over again. Bank 1 is located near the CPU (the XLT's CPU gets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; extremely hot), so mayby it's damaged due to overheating?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Could be, if it happens *all* the time, even when cold. If only when warm,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then perhaps simply increasing airflow/cooling might help.  
</EM><BR>
<P>No it 'just happened', the XLT was running just fine nonstop
<BR>
for about 2.5 years. I only turned it off about 3 times for 
<BR>
adding extra hardware. BWT I've added an extra fan just in case :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Does the XLT not have a fan on top of the CPU, or does it use the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; front fan via some kind of plastic &quot;funnel&quot; to channel the air?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, it has a cute plastic airflow 'funnel' ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And does that now limit you to 4 slots instead of 8?  I don't think it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; affects the speed, IIRC, as the XLT doesn't have a 256-bit wide mode as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; PC164 does...
</EM><BR>
<P>Dunno, AFAIK the XLT does have the 256-bit wide mode, the plain XL's
<BR>
have not (they only have 6 slots total).
<BR>
<P>Regards,
