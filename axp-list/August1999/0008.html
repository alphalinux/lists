<P><EM>&gt;Having found that I had major file system corruruption that caused all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sorts of weird scsi errors I proceeded to wipe everything out and start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from scratch. The scsi card is a ncr53c895 (datastorm 32+) and I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;two scsi drives, the system is a 164LX. I low level formated and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;verified both disks and found nothing physicaly wrong with them. I then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;proceeded to install RH 6.0. I booted milo from a floppy and got into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the install. I set up my partitons and go further into the install but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm held back by the installer saying I have no swap partitons defined. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeap... that's really a pain in the neck. However , after installation
<BR>
completes , you can replace your swap partition with a swap file (mkswap etc.).
<BR>
Therefore , supposing for example that you have your /home on a different
<BR>
partition than / , you can use two adjacent partitions for /home and swap and
<BR>
after installation completes , you can wipe out that swap partition and glue it
<BR>
together with /home. (Just a scenario ...).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I then tried to use fdisk and a simple setup. 127MB swap and the rest /.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I tagged fs label on each parititon wrote the partition table to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disks and then exited fdisk. The installer then wanted to reboot the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;system so I did and when it came time to setup  the file systems the fs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they claimed having was a number (0x6). I then deleted then and created
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;new paritions and tried to continue but was confronted with the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;error.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>If i'm not wrong , rh6 installer actually formats your partitions after they
<BR>
are fdisk'ed. Maybe you were asked to do so and you mistakenly answered 'no' ,
<BR>
or there is something wrong with your images. In the first case , just repeat
<BR>
the procedure , formatting the correspondent partitions (installer will ask for
<BR>
both the swap partition and the / etc...). In the second case , you can try to
<BR>
format these partition by hand , switching to the virtual console you have
<BR>
during the phase 2 of installation (Alt-F2) , and mke2fs-ing the partitions you
<BR>
want to use.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Now frustrated I tried to install NT on the system (Please forgive me).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I did the express parition setup (which worked) and tried to install NT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only for the kernel to crash with a INACESSABLE_BOOT_DEVICE aka &quot;I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;recognize your scsi controller&quot;. After this happened i switch my bios
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;over to SRM 5.4 and tried to install Alpha/NetBSD and Alpha/FreeBSD.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Both failed with an error creating the filesystem. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>No experience with these. Sorry ...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;During this time I had one U2W drive connected setup on id 2 with an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;active terminator. My scsi card only offers auto termination, it won't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;let me set it otherwise. So techniclly my scsi setup is correct.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I suppose that your default firmware is AlphaBIOS. Check out through boot
<BR>
messages whether it recognises you hard disk drive and controller. If so , your
<BR>
scsi setup must be fine. Otherwise check it out. However , since you managed to
<BR>
fdisk the whole thing , your scsi configuration must be working. BTW , what's
<BR>
the size of your hard disk drive? I mean , is everything fine with it (not
<BR>
being to big for fdisk to manage etc...) ?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So I've wiped the slate clean and now I'm unable to install any OS on my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Alpha. All suggestions and ideas are greatly appreciated. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Hope you'll work it out...
