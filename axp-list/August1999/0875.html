<P>I have used afio in the past, and it works well.  It's been a long time
<BR>
since I studied this, but as I recall the problem with compressing the
<BR>
stream as a whole using a Lempel-Ziv type algorithm is that a single bit
<BR>
error potentially corrupts the entire stream past that point.  If you
<BR>
compress on a file by file basis, then errors are confined to the file
<BR>
in which they occur.  The downside to this is that if you have a lot of
<BR>
small files, then you don't get a good compression ratio.
<BR>
<P>I haven't tried this, but perhaps one could use bzip2 (which uses a
<BR>
different compression algorithm) instead of gzip or compress?  From the
<BR>
bzip2 man page:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bzip2 compresses files in blocks, usually 900kbytes long.  Each
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;block is handled independently.  If a media or transmission error
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;causes a multi-block .bz2 file to become damaged, it may be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possible to recover data from the undamaged blocks in the file.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compressed representation of each block is delimited by a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48-bit pattern, which makes it possible to find the block
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boundaries with reasonable certainty.  Each block also carries
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its own 32-bit CRC, so damaged blocks can be distinguished from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;undamaged ones.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bzip2recover is a simple program whose purpose is to search for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blocks in .bz2 files, and write each block out into its own .bz2
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;file.  You can then use bzip2 -t to test the integrity of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resulting files, and decompress those which are undamaged.
<BR>
<P>Has anyone studied this?
