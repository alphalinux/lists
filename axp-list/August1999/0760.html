<P><EM>&gt; I chatted with the Loki people and they were comitted to do Alpha Bits they just didn앖 know when. So I앏l send in a order for 10 lic. of every game they release just aslong as they release the Alpha Bits anyone else want to help??
</EM><BR>
<P>I've already bought one copy of the game. The best thing is usually just
<BR>
to write to them and let them know that there are people out there who
<BR>
want an Alpha port. I've seen some PPC code for CivCTP on their website
<BR>
but no Alpha yet.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; have anyone tried Wine or bochs on Alpha Linux, or more inportantly have anyone tried to get wine to run Alpha NT code??
</EM><BR>
<P>Wine, in theory Wine should be able to run WinNT/Alpha apps under
<BR>
AlphaLinux. I think it doesn't compile at the moment possibly due to
<BR>
64-bit issues. I wrote to one of the developers a while back about any way
<BR>
that alphalinux.org could help them along and he said that they are
<BR>
planning to work on an Alpha version, they just don't have the time yet.
<BR>
So anybody with skills there could obviously help them out.
<BR>
<P>Bochs will compile and run on Alpha. It's SSSLLLOOOWWW....I ran it on my
<BR>
XL300 a while ago and I think I got Win3.1 up and running, but painfully
<BR>
slow.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What about that VMware??, I guess there will be quite a big market for that nowdays :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Nope, that processor specific.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Finaly my apologies for the handholding requests ;-D
</EM><BR>
<P>No appology needed.
