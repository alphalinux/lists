<EM>&gt; &gt; Plan on putting them in a separate case.

<EM>&gt; This is better idea, to put in a separate case.

<P>I installed the Seagate's today. They come up OK.
<BR>
Haven't tried an fsck yet. For those who are interested
<BR>
hdparm showed disk speed from the disk at 22.72MB/sec.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;From a 7200rpm drive, no less. 9-10MB/sec faster than
</EM><BR>
my current drives. We'll see how they do with a real
<BR>
dataset in a bit. So far, so good.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The Atlas 10K is advertised as the fastest disk around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; so I would expect it to run hot. Probably not as hot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I didn't know about ad, but it's quite fast.  Not as hot as SEAGATE.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>What Seagates?? The 18GB/36GB/50GB??
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I recommend to get bigger box for better cooling.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for graphic card, I recommend ELSA gloria for Tru64 UNIX.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For linux, there should be cheaper 8MBs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SCSI card wise, I'd still go with Intraserver for optimized performance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm trying an S3 Trio64 card at the moment. Mostly, I just
<BR>
need a VGA console to boot thru with a KVM switch setup.
<BR>
I saw some Graphics Blaster Permedia2 based cards with
<BR>
4MB memory for $25 on Pricewatch.com That would work too
<BR>
since that's the chip set in the Elsa Gloria, I think.
<BR>
<P>I use an Intel PII as my graphics console at my desk and
<BR>
plan on continuing that. So, a good card isn't needed,
<BR>
only that SRM is happy with it.
<BR>
<P>I'm using a Tekram Symbios 895 based card at the moment.
<BR>
SRM doesn't like that one though. Linux 2.2.3 is quite happy
<BR>
with it. Which Intraserver card works in SRM for booting?
<BR>
Seems SRM is quite picky about what it will access.
<BR>
<P>I'll be trying the other SCSI cards over the next day or two.
