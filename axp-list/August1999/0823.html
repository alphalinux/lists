Hello,
<BR>
<P>I probably have a fairly unique situation here and I wanted to probe the
<BR>
minds of a some intelligent individuals.  Thats why you're reading this
<BR>
now.
<BR>
<P>I want to install RHL (or any Linux for that matter) on a Multia.  The
<BR>
unique part of the equation is, I want to install it as a diskless client.
<BR>
<P>Here's the catch... I don't want to temporarily hook a drive up to the
<BR>
machine for the initial install.  And I don't have a currently installed
<BR>
&quot;alpha&quot; from which to create the mountable / and /usr partitions for a
<BR>
diskless client.
<BR>
<P>Questions:
<BR>
1) Is it feasible to use rpm on an intel to install .alpha packages to a
<BR>
different 'root' path using --root --ignorearch? (to manually create the
<BR>
root for the alpha nfsmount)
<BR>
<P>2) Does any distribution's install support installing to a root over NFS
<BR>
rather than to a root on a local disk partition?
<BR>
<P>3) What is the best way to boot the kernel for something like this from a
<BR>
multia(without a hard disk)?  Using SRM netboot, or floppy?
<BR>
<P>4) Are there any caveats to what I'm trying to do here? (Is there
<BR>
something that makes parts of this impossible?)
<BR>
<P><P>Thanks,
<BR>
Brian Hayward
<BR>
[who currently has a Multia on the way...]
<BR>
<P>Another question:  My research shows that the Multia has both SCSI and
<BR>
IDE controllers, is this correct?
<BR>
<P><PRE>
