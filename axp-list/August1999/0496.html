Hi,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I've done it - I've got my 34GB IBM IDE drive in my Alpha/LX - here
<BR>
are some problems and pointers that I've discovered:
<BR>
<P>(AlphaBIOS guru's please see point 7 - especially if anyone knows where
<BR>
to report AlphaBIOS bugs to))
<BR>
<P>Hardware: Alpha LX motherboard, Promise Ultra/66 controller, IBM 34GB
<BR>
7200RPM Ultra/66 IDE drive.
<BR>
<P>1) Inserted Promise Ultra/66 in spare PCI slot - AlphaBIOS (5.60) hung
<BR>
while the promise probed for drives.  Reset, hit escape to skip SCSI
<BR>
initialisation stuff and got the BIOS, downloaded the latest AlphaBIOS
<BR>
(5.661-E) and upgraded it.  Now it gets into AlphaBIOS OK - but the
<BR>
Promise says that 'Ultra Bios not installed' AlphaBIOS doesn't know
<BR>
anything about drives connected to the Promise.
<BR>
<P>2) The ancient version of MILO I had repeatedly hang at calibrarting
<BR>
delay loop (even on boots where I didn't change the config).  Put new MILO
<BR>
on floppy using another machine, booted 2.2.7 as previously installed.
<BR>
<P>3) 2.2.7 didn't see the Promise at all (except in /proc/pci) but definitly
<BR>
not as an IDE card.  Hacked IDE code to notice it - but got very low
<BR>
performance (non-DMA).  Noticed that 2.3.1 had a driver in, so I upgraded
<BR>
to the latest 2.3.14 - don't turn on the Burst mode for the Promise - my
<BR>
machine just hang while probind on it.
<BR>
<P>4) hdparm'd and time dd'd my 34GB drive on both the Promise and the
<BR>
internal CMD646 controller.  Found that the internal CMD646 was about 30%
<BR>
faster!!!! (Even when shared with a DVD as a slave on the IBM drive)
<BR>
Also found some touchyness on the Promise - sometimes I got wierd crashes
<BR>
- not sure why.
<BR>
<P>5) Now a big problem - Linux was only seeing something like 769/16/63
<BR>
drive geometry - not the 2^16+769/16/63 geometry which it should have
<BR>
seen.  This turns out to be a bug in the kernel; 2.2.x and 2.3.x (not sure
<BR>
about older ones) can't cope with drives bigger than about 32GB on IDE -
<BR>
and what is more they ignore hdc=C,H,S command line options for these
<BR>
large drives.  Mail me for the fix (this is not an Alpha specific problem)
<BR>
<P>6) After a while of partitioning, fsck'ing and copying i now have almost
<BR>
everything on the IDE drive.  I have one problem left.
<BR>
<P>7) AlphaBIOS doesn't seem to be able to load MILO off the IDE drive, it
<BR>
sees the drive in the hard disc section but it says it is 'Off line'
<BR>
<P>As a side issue 2.3.14 seems pretty stabe - I've not had any problems so
<BR>
far - done quite a few kernel rebuilds without hastle.  I ran lmbench and
<BR>
the 'mmap latency' seems to be a lot lower than 2.2. - so that can't be
<BR>
bad.
<BR>
<P>An hdparm of the drive on the inbuilt CMD646 gives about 12.5MB/s and the
<BR>
system feels a hell of a lot more responsive than the mix of slightly
<BR>
ageing SCSI drives (on Adaptec 2940U) I had before.
<BR>
