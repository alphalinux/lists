Hi there,
<BR>
<P>First, sorry for being off-topic, this is a question concerning
<BR>
PVM and I noticed that some of you are using it.
<BR>
<P>A bit of background: I'm working as a sysadmin at a software
<BR>
company and we're developing some sort of knowledge management
<BR>
system which is based on a client-server architecture.
<BR>
Currently we're thinking about replacing our current middleware
<BR>
with something else (open-source if possible) and a colleague of
<BR>
mine is having a look at PVM. AFAIK he's rather pleased with it,
<BR>
but unfortunately it appears, that if you want 2 machines to
<BR>
communicate, you have to have a pvm daemon running on each. My
<BR>
question is: Is there some way that we can avoid having to run a
<BR>
daemon on the client (our client is written in java and we don't
<BR>
want to port the pvm stuff)? Please assume that I don't know
<BR>
much about pvm.
<BR>
<P>Many thanx in advance,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Konrad
<BR>
<P><P>P.S.: I don't think a lot of people are interested in this, so
<BR>
please contact me off the list.
<BR>
