Redhat Linux 6.1 or possibly 6.0 (dunno, it was about 18 months ago)

<EM>&gt; Yeap!  It is really a small wonder that it works with 21143 at all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It looks like that transmitters on your card have &quot;backwards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compatibility&quot; mode.
</EM><BR>
<P>I thought I had a 21142, I've not needed to pay attention to such details in the past, but the de4x5 tells me it's a 21143. I don't know the difference to be honest.

<EM>&gt; Recent kernels have also 'old_tulip' driver.  Did you try that one?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This one is supposedly not needed in the really current 2.2 kernels
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but with all variants of tulip cards floating around I would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; careful with that.
</EM><BR>
<P>Haven't had a chance to try yet.
<BR>
When I get a leased line, I'll download and upgrade to 6.2. ATM I'm stuck at 6.1 or whatever.
<BR>
I'm not sure what to make of the dmesg info. I'll probably get back to the list when I've upgraded .
