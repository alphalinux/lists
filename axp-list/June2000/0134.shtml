<P><EM>&gt; I have a bunch of DS20Es running 2.2.14-6.0smp (the kernel compiled by

<EM>&gt; RedHat for RH 6.2), and they have several spinlock stuck messages while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; booting, and more systematically happen when doing certain things (loading a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; particular module). What's more annoying is that the machines occasionally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; freeze under heavy load, and when they do, they're periodically printing a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spinlock message on their console.

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; Does this 2.2.16 patch perhaps fix this or does it go deeper? When Alpha SMP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was first developed it was stress tested on an ES40 by Jay and friends; do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all 2.2 kernel releases get similar testing these days? It's hard to believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that 2.2.14-6.0smp would pass that test.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Uh, when Alpha SMP was developed, ES40s didn't exist. :)  At least, not unless
<BR>
Jay had a _very_ early proto, that is... (Probably pre-EV6, at that...)
<BR>
Anyway, yes, I do occasionally stress test releases, but most of my testing has
<BR>
been done under the 2.3/2.4test series in recent months.  I know that others
<BR>
have now and again stressed the 2.2 series for varying purposes.
<BR>
<P>The &quot;spinlock stuck&quot; message is just a debugging aid AFAIK, albeit a possible
<BR>
hint for problems in design.  I routinely have AIM runs where I'll see these
<BR>
messages scroll on by the dozens, and performance is still quite good.  If
<BR>
you're really concerned, you could also check out the crash tools from Mission
<BR>
Critical (haven't tried them, but have used their counterparts on Tru64 and
<BR>
they're quite good).  If you're still concerned, maybe we can try to replicate
<BR>
what's happening here and I'll take a closer look.

<P>My $0.02.
