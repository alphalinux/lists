<EM>&gt; &gt; Up front I'd say that Linux's NFS server can be a little shaky at best. As
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; an SMB server it's fine, but NFS isn't quite there yet (neither x86 nor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Alpha).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yeah, I know that first hand -- especially since I have Solaris
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clients!  But SPARC hardware is expensive and I heard that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Solaris/x86 isn't as feature filled as it's 64-bit native port.  I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kinda looking at using ReiserFS, but no one knows what kinda of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; locking issues (if any) to expect running NFS on it.
</EM><BR>
<P>ReiserFS isn't on Alpha yet. I think there are plans to do this but I
<BR>
would guess at the moment it takes 2nd priority to getting ReiserFS into
<BR>
the kernel.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Otherwise, I'm looking at NetApp's F700-series since they current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use Alpha, are far easier to manage and have some nice techniques to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; getting good NFS performance, filesystem efficiency and drastically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reduced boot time.
</EM><BR>
<P>The NetApp boxes are very nice....but they do tend to be pricey.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Yes, AlphaLinux support &gt;2Gig files.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If it supports &gt;2GB files on Ext2, it probably does as well for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ReiserFS I assume?
</EM><BR>
<P>See above.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Any other 64-bit benefits you guys can think of that Linux/Alpha has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; over Linux/x86?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; No idea. [RE: Mylex DAC960 support]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I just read some archives where people are using the DAC960 driver
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on Alpha.  Unfortunately I'm having trouble finding any info on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; patching MILO to support booting from DAC960 drives like you do for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; LILO on x86.  Although that may be an x86-only thing since, from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what I've read, MILO just boots the OS on Alpha, whereas LILO is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; both the boot sector (option, you can use another boot manager) and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the OS loader.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sort of...but not quite. Alphas have historically had 2
<BR>
firmwares. AlphaBIOS and SRM. AlphaBIOS was used for booting NT, and SRM
<BR>
was used for DU (Tru64) and VMS. Now AlphaBIOS is dead seeing NT on Alpha
<BR>
is no more (No, I don't beleive the rumors). MILO is only needed if you
<BR>
boot from AlphaBIOS. SRM boots the kernel via a secondary boot loader
<BR>
called 'aboot'. So, does SRM support the DAC960? If it doesn't you could
<BR>
always attached a boot disk to the onboard SCSI, boot the kernel from
<BR>
there.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The only other concern is the size of the RAID and FDISK.  I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reading that FDISK only supports 65,536 cylinders???  If you use the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 8GB translation (63sec, 255hds), that would be a maximum of ~512GB
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I might get close to that.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm.....haven't played with an array that big yet so I can't speak on that
<BR>
one.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I've used the Acenic cards (Alteon) w/o any trouble. Can't speak for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the &gt; NetGear.
