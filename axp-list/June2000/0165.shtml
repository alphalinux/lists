<EM>&gt; I don't look at the system console much unless there's trouble

<EM>&gt; or I need to shut things down so I rarely look at these messages.

<EM>&gt; The key is they are not specific to boot time. I take it these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; messages indicate the hang is around 2 seconds, which makes sense
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given I send 16MB over 100Mb Enet, which would mean PVM is sustaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around 8MB/sec, actually quite good from my point of view. I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surprised the other processor would have to wait while another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; processor was receiving network data. The lock must protect large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; portions of the kernel code. At some point I'll go back and try
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 2.4.test series but not real soon.

<P>This is starting to sound familiar.

<P>I'm not really an expert on Linux SMP, but as I recall the coarse
<BR>
locking used in the Linux net code was largely responsible for its poor
<BR>
showing on the Mindcraft tests, in which they tested a quad processor
<BR>
Intel box.  There was some discussion at the time on linux-kernel about
<BR>
rewriting the net code for 2.3.  I don't know whether that happened.  It
<BR>
certainly hasn't been backported to 2.2.
<BR>
<P>By any chance is that 16MB transmitted with a single system call (i.e.
<BR>
one large socket write)?
