<P>
Sorry, I accidentally sent this as a reply to mpg123.   Since it
<BR>
is clearly not a reply, I will repeat with a correct Subject line.
<BR>
Thanks.
<BR>
<P>Since installing the milo on my SX-164 that came with RedHat 6.0,
<BR>
NO version of milo subsequent to that has worked.  It goes through
<BR>
the alpha console boot and begins the process of setting up the
<BR>
PCI stuff (i.e., the ATI MACH 64 banner spins) but about half way
<BR>
through the spinning of the Video BIOS banner,  it has died ever
<BR>
since.   The one that came with RedHat 6.1 and one of the versions
<BR>
announced on alphalinux following that  hung mid-way through the
<BR>
process.  This latest version makes it to about the same point and
<BR>
then jumps all the way back to starting place for milo.  The banner
<BR>
starts spinning again after you see some PCI setup activity and
<BR>
that is as far as it gets.
<BR>
<P>My machine:
<BR>
<P>AlphaPC  164SX  Motherboard
<BR>
ATI Mach64  (not Rage)
<BR>
SB AWE64 Soundcard
<BR>
Netgear NIC (tulip)
<BR>
WD Caviar IDE drive
<BR>
256 Mb of PC100 SDRAM
<BR>
AlphaBios 2.70
<BR>
<P>I cannot get it to compile.  I run
<BR>
<P>make KSRC=/usr/src/linux config
<BR>
<P>and that seems to go well but then
<BR>
<P>make KSRC=/usr/src/linux
<BR>
<P>dies with the following error messages:
<BR>
<P>as -m21164 -o micropal.o micropal.i
<BR>
ld -e Start -o micropal micropal.o
<BR>
(cd /usr/src/linux/arch/alpha/boot/tools ; gcc objstrip.c -o objstrip
<BR>
/bin/sh: -c: line 2: syntax error: unexpected end of file
<BR>
make: *** [/usr/src/linux/arch/alpha/boot/tools/objstrip] Error 2
<BR>
<P><P><P>Pretty simple setup.  I would have believed that Milo would have
<BR>
no trouble with this.  Do I have the right version (i.e., is 164SX
<BR>
SX164?) or does anyone else have any insight?
<BR>
<P>Frustrated in NJ,
<BR>
Bob
