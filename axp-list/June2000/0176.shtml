<EM>&gt; &gt; Which release was this?  I'm trying to collect a hit list of locks to go take a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; look at, and from first glance, it appears this is another lock_kernel() call.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Interesting thing is, it's being held in what appears to be llseek(), and tried for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in something I can't find (socket.c:43 is still in the comments, at least in 2.2 as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is select.c:43...).  Seeing as this file:line# pair is generated from the gcc
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; __FILE__ and __LINE__ macros, I'm not sure what's wrong there - Jay?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is kernel 2.2.15pre17 with a couple minor patches, nfsv3, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ide DMA patches. llseek makes no sense. pvmd shouldn't write to disk.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is more likely socket calls only, both local and remote. PVM uses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a UNIX type socket to talk to local processes I believe and an INET
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; socket to talk to the world.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Hrm....interesting thing is, the only things in read_write.c are (l)lseek, and various
<BR>
read()s and write()s.  Any chance you could match the addresses given in either the
<BR>
System.map or a disassembly dump (or with gdb)?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If Greg can reproduce similar messages, then I'll let him work with you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all to sort it out. My point in posting was just to confirm this was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not a boot time only problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Interesting thing tho' is that this is coming from different areas than Greg's are.
<BR>
Greg's messages come from insmod and identd colliding in schedule.  Yours are quite
<BR>
different.  Same lock probably, but different nonetheless...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; BTW, it appears that this is happening when the pvmd3 process is reading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (apparently large amounts of) data from a socket and writing it to the file, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; perhaps the inverse.  This could _perhaps_ be improved by writing the data out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; faster, rather than batching it up in cache.  It's only a guess, but it might help
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; if your disk is fast enough.  *shrug*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  - Pete  (still muttering about the !@#$*$@#^ kernel lock...)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Large is relative. I'm sending around 16MB of data every 10-50
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; secs. Total input dataset is around 300-400GB for this run. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systems each use quite fast disk. hdparm shows them at 15+MB/sec.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There is practically no disk I/O in this code on worker nodes except
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the end when they save their results.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm....Greg's suggestion to strace it and attempt to correlate the syscall traces would
<BR>
be really good here.  MHO.
