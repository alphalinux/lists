<P>
In October of 1997 I bought a cluster of 16 LX164 machines.  I use
<BR>
one of them as the master or &quot;head&quot; node, and do all my coding and
<BR>
interactive work on that machine.
<BR>
<P>About once out of every 5 or 10 times I run &quot;startx&quot; on that machine,
<BR>
it crashes hard, such that only hitting the reset button will bring it
<BR>
back to life.  It always happens before the window manager starts.
<BR>
I am pretty sure it's crashing during the initialization of the
<BR>
X-server.  Some X-servers (Accelerated-X, for example) paint a nice,
<BR>
colorful 'X' on the screen during initialization.  The crash leaves
<BR>
that image only half-painted.  With XFree86, the crash just leaves the
<BR>
screen black.  If I can get past the initialization of the X-server,
<BR>
then X comes up OK and is stable.  The crashing behavior is very
<BR>
unpredictable.  Sometimes I can do 20 invocations of startx (maybe
<BR>
one or two per day) without crashing.  Other times it will crash as
<BR>
many as 3 times in a row.  On days like that, it takes about 20 or
<BR>
30 minutes just to get the machine to bring up X, because each crash
<BR>
causes a long fsck during the next reboot.  This is MOST annoying!
<BR>
<P>I've been plagued by this problem since I got the machines.  The
<BR>
vendor has been extremely cooperative in trying to help me solve it,
<BR>
sending me alternative video cards to try, etc., but nothing has
<BR>
worked.  For most of the time I've had the cluster, I could do much
<BR>
of my work without X, but now my need for it is increasing.  Of
<BR>
course, I could just set up an Intel box as an X-terminal, and I
<BR>
will if don't fix this soon, but that would complicate my life in
<BR>
other ways.
<BR>
<P>Has anyone else seen this problem?  Does anyone have any suggestions?
<BR>
<P>Below is a brief description of the machine and a short summary of the
<BR>
various things I have tried.  I am also appending, as attachments, the
<BR>
output of 'dmesg' and the .config file I used to compile the kernel.
<BR>
<P>Thanks in advance for your help!

<P><P>The hardware:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;164LX motherboard, 21164a, 533MHz, 128 MB SDRAM
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 Digital DE-500A NICs
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 Intraserver 3140U SCSI card
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 SCSI hard disks
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 SCSI tape drive (4mm DAT)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 SCSI CDROM drive 12X Toshiba
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 IDE  CDROM drive 12X Toshiba
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 floppy drive
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matrox Millennium II video card, 4Mb
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;300 W power supply
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The machine has lots of devices in it, which raises the possibility
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that it's all just too much for the power supply.  So I tried
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stripping it down to only two SCSI disks, no floppy, no tape,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no CDROM drives, no NICs, and it would still crash on startx,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as described above.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried two different Matrox Millennium II cards and one
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elsa Gloria Synergy with 8MB.  I have replaced the Intraserver
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;card once (for an unrelated failure), but putting in a new one
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;didn't solve the crash on startx.  I have tried rearranging the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pci cards in different slots in many combinations.  I have tried
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two different LX164 motherboards.  I have replaced the DIMMS.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of that helps.
<BR>
<P>The firmware and software:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently I am using SRM V5.3-3 Sep 24 1998 14:02:11, freshly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;downloaded a couple of weeks ago.   I had also used 4.9-51
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and 5.0-1.  I am using aboot 0.5-7, the one that came with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RedHat 5.2.  I have used RedHat 4.2 and 5.2 with this machine.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently it has a RedHat 5.2 that has had its compiler upgraded
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to egcs-2.91.66 and its kernel upgraded to 2.2.14.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am currently using XFree86-3.3.3.1-1.  I have tried several
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earlier versions dating back to 1997.  I use the svga server
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the Matrox cards and the 3DLabs server for the Elsa Gloria.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also tried Metro-X 4.3.1 and Accelerated-X 4.1.2 with the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matrox cards.  The window manager is fvwm-1.24r-15, but I doubt
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is relevant.
