<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Around last October, Lars Hjorth reported a process time accounting problem to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; axp-list. Was that resolved?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We are running kernel 2.2.16 on several UP2000 Dual Alpha machines and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are seeing the same problem. i.e. There is no reported cpu usage on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; second cpu even though we know it is being used. For each process,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/cpu always shows cpu1 with no time. /proc/cpuinfo does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; show 2 active cpus. The machines were deliverd with 2.2.14 and had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the problem with that kernel also.
</EM><BR>
<P>aa patch fixed that problem on 2.2.15 but have not seen them patch for
<BR>
2.2.16 yet...
<BR>
<P>I will try w/ Jay's suggestion that might help.
<BR>
<P>regards,
<BR>
