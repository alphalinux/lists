<EM>&gt; &gt; The &quot;spinlock stuck&quot; message is just a debugging aid AFAIK,

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ... and I should also mention that I'm getting spinlock grabbed. Which is an

<EM>&gt; error, not a warning.

<P>I beg your pardon?
<BR>
<P>Both of those prints are part of the &quot;debugging&quot; code associated with
<BR>
the SMP lock primitives. They are meant to be informative; the &quot;stuck&quot;
<BR>
one indicates when a lock is being held for a long period of time
<BR>
(relatively speaking, and essentially an arbitrary definition of &quot;long&quot;).
<BR>
<P>The &quot;grabbed&quot; message simply indicates when a process that was &quot;stuck&quot;
<BR>
actually got the lock. The &quot;ticks&quot; indicated are jiffies, of course,
<BR>
and on ALPHA there are usually 1024/second, so when a &quot;grabbed&quot;
<BR>
message is printed saying it waited for 6732 ticks, that's 6+ seconds.
<BR>
That seemed awful long to me when I first saw it, so I asked either
<BR>
Linus or Alan about it, and they said it was &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;reasonable&quot;,
<BR>
so I stopped worrying. Perhaps it's time to ask again, though I'd be
<BR>
quite worried if I saw that much time on a 2.4.xx kernel... ;-}
<BR>
<P>In addition, the &quot;stuck&quot; and &quot;grabbed&quot; messages indicate on which CPU
<BR>
the &quot;stickee&quot; and the &quot;owner&quot; are running. If you see a bunch of &quot;stuck&quot;
<BR>
messages with the same owner/CPU, they're all waiting for that one.
<BR>
<P>If you see a bunch of &quot;stuck&quot; messages, and no &quot;grabbed&quot;, THAT is a
<BR>
problem, ie usually the owner/CPU has died some horrible death without
<BR>
releasing the lock, and no progress can ever be made - you're hosed.
<BR>
<P>Is this what you're seeing?
