<P>
I'm going through this phase with my Red Hat Linux cluster (10 va linux
<BR>
boxes) where I can't tell if I have enough of them or not.  Ever felt that
<BR>
way?  I have no real way of determining the over all bottle necks or seeing
<BR>
if are indeed ANY bottle necks.  Btw, these are used as web servers running
<BR>
apache w/mod_perl.
<BR>
<P>So, in disgust of this feeling of being in a black open space and not
<BR>
knowing jack, I'm on a small quest to figure this stuff out and accurately
<BR>
predict the resource utilization and bottlenecks for present and future so
<BR>
that I can know things like &quot;Hey, in a month or so you may need to add
<BR>
another 1GB of memory to your front-end boxes and add 2 more machines&quot;.
<BR>
Where as now it's more like &quot;Well, none of the servers crashed this week,
<BR>
guess they are doing okay&quot;.
<BR>
<P>So the Q's:
<BR>
-  Where can I find TFM on this stuff.  I want to learn!!!  Yeah, I know...
<BR>
there is no manual.  But any (subtle or not so subtle) clues would be nice.
<BR>
-  Software or even hardware packages which can help with this?
<BR>
-  Out Source this quest to a company that masters it, are they out there?
<BR>
Can I learn from them (as this task of planning for the future will probably
<BR>
be a regular thing, unless I die soon)
<BR>
<P>-----------------------------------------------------
<BR>
A Somewhat DIFFERENT Note:
<BR>
I hacked up a system monitoring system that gives me graphs for whatever I
<BR>
tell it (CPU Idle time, Memory usage, httpd children, total proc's, swap,
<BR>
etc).  It looks great but I have this fear in the back of my mind concerning
<BR>
the CPU Idle % numbers...
<BR>
I grab a CPU Idle% number every 5 minutes by grabbing the output from:
<BR>
vmstat 60 2
<BR>
<P>Is that accurate enough to plot over time and look for spikes?
<BR>
Example: every day or so I'll see a drop from 98% CPU Idle to 75%.  Should I
<BR>
be concerned about this?
<BR>
<P>Thanks for the help... oh, and please email me and I'll be sure to write a
<BR>
summery on this issue.
<BR>
<P>May you live long, prosper!
