<EM>&gt; If you built XFree86 with the system compiler, it likely did not

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the compilation.

<P>I had built gcc 2.95.2 from tarball (came out as alphaev56-...).  As
<BR>
you suspected, I did not add -mcpu=pca56 to my compilations, though.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In my case MVI was used by default, since I had earlier rebuilt GCC from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; source for alphapca56-unknown-linux-gnu.  I had done this before to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BWX into XFree (and all other packages I build from source).  But I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; didn't know until today that GCC generates MVI instructions too...
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks - I getcha.  After I patched my kernel, I rebuilt the gcc from
<BR>
scratch (this time it came out as alphapca56-...) before rebuilding
<BR>
XFree, 'cuz I figured this very problem would be an issue.  I did
<BR>
have this all sorted out in my head at the time, but not this morning
<BR>
I guess :)  Thanks again...
<BR>
