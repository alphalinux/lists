This goes back to the Xfree crashing with SRM thread. Basicly ever since I
<BR>
upgraded to 6.2 I've gotten nothing but trouble. I use XF-4 (which does not
<BR>
come with RH) because I have a voodoo 3000. It just likes to cut out after a
<BR>
while.

<P><P>| What were the instabilities?  I just installed 6.2 (I guess XF 4.0 is part

| &gt;
| &gt; Well,
| &gt; My instabilities with my system are fixed. I reinstalled RH-6.1.
| &gt; Everything is working fine (cept sound) and the system is stable once
| &gt; again. I'm even using XF-4.0 compiled on 6.2 and everything is stable.
| &gt; I don't know what could have caused such instabilities in 6.2 but I'll
| &gt; tell you I won't be so quick to upgrade to the next rev of redhat.
| &gt; Now I can build more RPMS instead of fixing my box.
