| Hi Peter --
<BR>
| Life on the bleeding edge.  Ain't it great?
<BR>
<P>Heh, bleeding edge? When i first installed 6.2 it would make my system reboot
<BR>
for no reason at all and X didnt work. I just want to get my system stable
<BR>
again :-)
<BR>
<P>| Do you have java turned on, by chance?  Just curious.  I'm also assuming
<BR>
| you read Linus' comments about 2.4-test1 :-)
<BR>
<P>Java is turned off and this happens regardless of weither in running 2.2.15 or
<BR>
2.4.0.
<BR>
Hey does anyone know where I could get a dynamicly linked version of osf\1
<BR>
netscape?
<BR>
I'm using 3.04 gold of the CD and it works fine (no crashes) and it only takes
<BR>
up 8MB or ram.
<BR>
<P>Peter

netscape

root),

to

with

| &gt; I tried downloading the latest netscape... same thing. I tried using older
| &gt; Du-4.0D libs. same thing. I'm convinced that it's netscape that is doing
| &gt; something naughty that is killing my system. I don't think it's a &quot;motif&quot;
| &gt; problem because I can run most of the motif linked binaries of the 4.0D CD
| &gt; (including mwm).  I don't suppose anyone else has a simliar configuration
