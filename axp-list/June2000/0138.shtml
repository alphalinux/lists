<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been working with Emmanuel Pierre on this problem and I can
<BR>
not replicate it on my Alpha (XL366, Debian 2.1). I have a feeling that
<BR>
his problem has to do with an optimizer bug in the version of gcc(egcs)
<BR>
that he is using. I have asked him to try a few different optimizer
<BR>
settings, and report back the results to me. I have not heard anything yet
<BR>
(but I only asked this morning).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the patches, they are alive and well. It is due to the
<BR>
large impact they would have on the pgsql source tree that they have not
<BR>
been intergrated into the main source tree. At current they would break a
<BR>
number of other platforms, and a large amount of the current patches will
<BR>
be obsoleted shortly by a fmgr rewrite that is currently in progress.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been keeping the patches up to date so they will apply to
<BR>
the 6.5.x and 7.0.x source trees, and allow one to build a fully working
<BR>
pgsql on Linux/Alpha. The patches are currently available on my websiste
<BR>
(see URL in sig below). I plan to work on integrating the non-fmgr related
<BR>
patches into the main source tree before pgsql 7.1 is released.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, have patience, the patches will make it in, and
<BR>
they are being maintained in the meantime. Sometime things just take
<BR>
longer than you would wish they would. :)
