<P>Which release was this?  I'm trying to collect a hit list of locks to go take a
<BR>
look at, and from first glance, it appears this is another lock_kernel() call.
<BR>
Interesting thing is, it's being held in what appears to be llseek(), and tried for
<BR>
in something I can't find (socket.c:43 is still in the comments, at least in 2.2 as
<BR>
is select.c:43...).  Seeing as this file:line# pair is generated from the gcc
<BR>
__FILE__ and __LINE__ macros, I'm not sure what's wrong there - Jay?
<BR>
<P>BTW, it appears that this is happening when the pvmd3 process is reading
<BR>
(apparently large amounts of) data from a socket and writing it to the file, or
<BR>
perhaps the inverse.  This could _perhaps_ be improved by writing the data out
<BR>
faster, rather than batching it up in cache.  It's only a guess, but it might help
<BR>
if your disk is fast enough.  *shrug*
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;- Pete  (still muttering about the !@#$*$@#^ kernel lock...)
