<P><EM>&gt; The &quot;grabbed&quot; message simply indicates when a process that was &quot;stuck&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually got the lock. The &quot;ticks&quot; indicated are jiffies, of course,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and on ALPHA there are usually 1024/second, so when a &quot;grabbed&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; message is printed saying it waited for 6732 ticks, that's 6+ seconds.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That seemed awful long to me when I first saw it, so I asked either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linus or Alan about it, and they said it was &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;reasonable&quot;,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so I stopped worrying. Perhaps it's time to ask again, though I'd be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quite worried if I saw that much time on a 2.4.xx kernel... ;-}
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Truth be told, that's a _really_ long time.  We start to freak out when we see
<BR>
locks in Tru64 have a waitsum of &gt;2 seconds _total_ in an hour benchmark run.  In
<BR>
Tru64, that's considered easy pickin's for perf guys like me, where it's a simple
<BR>
sign of bad lock design.  But then again, Tru64 has probably in the area of an
<BR>
order of magnitude (at least) more locks than Linux does, so one lock hogging
<BR>
that much time is a much clearer sign than the more coarse granularity of Linux.
<BR>
<P>So what am I saying?  Yes, it is a bad thing from a perf perspective, and only
<BR>
gets worse as the systems get bigger and faster.  That's why I try to keep on top
<BR>
of the lockmeter code for Alpha (can be gotten from SGI, works now with a small
<BR>
patch from me until John integrates it) - so we can make sure we always know what
<BR>
is going on whenever possible.  (Not helpful in this case, as it's at boot time,
<BR>
but other than that...)
<BR>
<P>BTW - Greg, could you send me a couple of lines of the &quot;spinlock stuck&quot; and
<BR>
&quot;spinlock grabbed&quot; messages?  I'm curious which locks are getting in the way, and
<BR>
if they're the same ones I see now and again...
<BR>
