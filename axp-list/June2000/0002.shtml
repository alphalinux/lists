<P>
I did something foolish.  I have/had an lx164 running 
<BR>
redhat 5.1 with kernel 2.2.10 and glibc 2.0.6.  I have
<BR>
been wanting to upgrade to glibc 2.1.3 for some time
<BR>
now but I hoped to be able to do it without doing a
<BR>
full upgrade to redhat 6.2.  After some botched
<BR>
attempts at compiling it (glibc) myself I decided to 
<BR>
try to upgrade just glibc with the RPM from redhat.
<BR>
rpm -U glibc-2.1.3-16.alpha
<BR>
&nbsp;failed dependancies so I did
<BR>
rpm -U --nodeps glibc-2.1.3-16.alpha   // oops!
<BR>
it copied the new libc files to /lib/  and created
<BR>
all the symlinks and stuff but died at some point.
<BR>
After that things stopped working..  duh..
<BR>
I decided to reboot.  //oops
<BR>
at this point I couldnt log in in multiuser mode 
<BR>
so I rebooted into single user mode.
<BR>
things seemed pretty ok.  I tried to install the old
<BR>
version of glibc I was using before: 
<BR>
rpm -U --oldversion glibc-2.0.7-29.alpha
<BR>
&quot;failed..  glibc-2.0.7-29 already installed&quot;
<BR>
it seemed like the rpm package database was messed up
<BR>
so I tried to rebuild the database.
<BR>
This failed with an error about running out of disk
<BR>
space.
<BR>
Unfortunately, at this point stuff like commands like
<BR>
ls stopped working.  
<BR>
I rebooted once more and got a kernel panic:  //oops! 
<BR>
<P>&quot;cant find init.. try specifying init=...&quot;  
<BR>
<P>So, I decided to hunt down a 6.2 cdrom and try the
<BR>
upgrade after all.  I managed to get hold of one and
<BR>
everything went fine using the GUI form until I
<BR>
selected upgrade.
<BR>
then the installation program tries to rebuild the
<BR>
package database and that fails with a 
<BR>
'possibly out of disk space error' and the installer
<BR>
freezes up.  I tried again with the expert and text
<BR>
flags but I got the same error and didnt see what I
<BR>
could do next.
<BR>
<P>basically I dont know how or if I can even look to see
<BR>
if there really is a drive space problem.  I seriously
<BR>
doubt there is but I dont know what else to do at this
<BR>
point.
<BR>
<P>Please help with any advice -- I really need it!
<BR>
<P>thanks,
<BR>
Jonathan
