Re: Benefits of Linux/Alpha over Linux/x86? &lt;- Width &amp; Interleave

<EM>&gt; Right. But, the XP1000 and UP2K both do 4 way DIMM interleave, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is really 8 way because a DIMM is already two way. Once you get to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that point, how would you gain anymore performance? That would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take another D-chip, if I remember the Alpha's chipset terminology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And, that is what makes the DS20/DP264 different from a UP2K
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since it does have two chips for accessing memory, but it also uses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 16 DIMM slots, 8 for each chip.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, both XP1000 and UP2K do not require the DIMM's in between sets to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be the same which to me, indicates the banks are quite separate. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only requirement is that each set of 4 is identical.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, if it were true 8 way improved speed, then how come the specs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't say that?
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, I think everyone is getting confused between Width, Switch and
<BR>
Interleave.  First off, I am ** NO EXPERT HERE ** and I'm probably
<BR>
not even using the correct terminology (please educated me ;-).  But
<BR>
I'm going to take some guesses ... based largely on just my college
<BR>
background (which doesn't really mean crap since I don't have any
<BR>
real-world design experience with mainboards/chipset) and what I can
<BR>
see from product spec sheets.
<BR>
<P>- Width (e.g, 64-bit, 128-bit, etc...)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the largest common width between the CPU and memory,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and I assume this is how mainboards are optimally designed.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;E.g., Slot-1/Slot-2/Socket-370 as well as Slot-A/Socket-A
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;are all 64-bit width busses, so most of these mainboards
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;use a 64-bit interconnect on the chipset between the CPUs
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and memory (1 DIMM).  Slot-B, on the otherhand, is a 128-bit
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;width bus so I assume Alpha (future Athlon &quot;Pro&quot; too???) use a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;128bit interconnect on the chipset between the CPUs and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and memory (2 DIMM).
<BR>
<P>- Switch (e.g., symmetric, point-to-point, NUMA, etc...)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;GTL+ (Slot-1/Slot-2/Socket-370) use a symmetric bus for multiple
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;CPU and memory channels.  As such, only 1 CPU, 1 memory or 1 I/O
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;channel can be communicating simultanously (???).  EV6 (Slot-A/
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Slot-B/Socket-A) uses a point-to-point bus so the chipset can
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;handle multiple points on each talking to each other.  Curious
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;as to how NUMA and point-to-point are similiar and different?
<BR>
<P>- Interleave (e.g. 2-way, 4-way, etc...)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Interleave can be used on any bus to reduce latency and increase
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;throughput.  Interleave involved changing the communication
<BR>
between
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;one node on the end of a symmetric or point-to-point bus between
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;one similiar bank (e.g., from one bank of memory to another) in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;order to reduce latency and increase throughput.  By alterating
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;banks every bus clock cycle (or set of clock ticks in a cycle),
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the latency of memory (usually much greater than a cycle of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;bus clock) can be reduced, especially when different read requests
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;are issued.  Secondly, in the case of non-synchronous memory
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;especially (like FPM, EDO, etc...), interleaving can spead up
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;transfers by interleaving bursts between banks of memory.
<BR>
<P>Again, I'm no expert and I'm just taking some guesses here.  But as
<BR>
far as I can tell, the design of a mainboard/chipset is 3-fold over
<BR>
these attributes.
