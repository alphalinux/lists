<EM>&gt; Up front I'd say that Linux's NFS server can be a little shaky at best. As
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an SMB server it's fine, but NFS isn't quite there yet (neither x86 nor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha).
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, I know that first hand -- especially since I have Solaris
<BR>
clients!  But SPARC hardware is expensive and I heard that
<BR>
Solaris/x86 isn't as feature filled as it's 64-bit native port.  I'm
<BR>
kinda looking at using ReiserFS, but no one knows what kinda of
<BR>
locking issues (if any) to expect running NFS on it.
<BR>
<P>Otherwise, I'm looking at NetApp's F700-series since they current
<BR>
use Alpha, are far easier to manage and have some nice techniques to
<BR>
getting good NFS performance, filesystem efficiency and drastically
<BR>
reduced boot time.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately I can old afford the low-end F720 model, which has
<BR>
only 1/4th the NVRAM of the more powerful F740/760 models (which
<BR>
makes a big impact on NFS performance).  In addition, the hardware
<BR>
used in the F700-series is now 18 months old and probably dated. 
<BR>
Transmeta said even the Alpha chip on-board can get taxied with XORs
<BR>
on heavy use.  And the F720 only has 256MB of RAM whereas I could
<BR>
afford 2-4GB of memory, with 2X the disk (newer disks at that) for
<BR>
an x86 or Alpha solution for about the same cost.
<BR>
<P>Also, to give everyone an idea of my needs:  0.25-0.5TB of storage,
<BR>
~10 NFS clients (mostly Solaris) that are 90% of my traffic, ~30 NT
<BR>
clients that are the other 10% of the traffic.  Looking to buy next
<BR>
month.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yes, AlphaLinux support &gt;2Gig files.
</EM><BR>
<P>If it supports &gt;2GB files on Ext2, it probably does as well for
<BR>
ReiserFS I assume?
<BR>
<P>Any other 64-bit benefits you guys can think of that Linux/Alpha has
<BR>
over Linux/x86?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No idea. [RE: Mylex DAC960 support]
</EM><BR>
<P>I just read some archives where people are using the DAC960 driver
<BR>
on Alpha.  Unfortunately I'm having trouble finding any info on
<BR>
patching MILO to support booting from DAC960 drives like you do for
<BR>
LILO on x86.  Although that may be an x86-only thing since, from
<BR>
what I've read, MILO just boots the OS on Alpha, whereas LILO is
<BR>
both the boot sector (option, you can use another boot manager) and
<BR>
the OS loader.
<BR>
<P>The only other concern is the size of the RAID and FDISK.  I was
<BR>
reading that FDISK only supports 65,536 cylinders???  If you use the
<BR>
8GB translation (63sec, 255hds), that would be a maximum of ~512GB
<BR>
and I might get close to that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've used the Acenic cards (Alteon) w/o any trouble. Can't speak for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; NetGear.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, I'm finding that.  Solaris/x86 supports the Acenic cards, but
<BR>
I couldn't find any info on support for the lower-costing NetGear
<BR>
GA620 card.  It uses the same chip, and has 512KB of SRAM like the
<BR>
one Acenic card.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; UP2000 has a single 256 bit memory bus, and just FYI SLOT-Bs don't come in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 500. Slowest would be 667. It also has dual PCI buses (64-bit).
</EM><BR>
<P>Gotta love that trunk!  It's why I used to use Alpha 164A solutions
<BR>
when Pentium Pros where the fastest Intel could offer and the 4-way
<BR>
boards were 3x the cost.
<BR>
<P>The RCC/ServerWorks ServerSet IIIHE x86 chipset also supports
<BR>
4x64-bit memory channels w/PC133 support, but the Tyan S1867DLUAN
<BR>
board only uses the 2-channel configuration.  I guess that's still
<BR>
better than most x86 mainboards, especially at a cost of only $599
<BR>
(quantity/wholesale) with on-board 2xU2SCSI/Net/Audio (only about
<BR>
$200 more than their own, reduced throughput i440GX server
<BR>
mainboard).
<BR>
<P>Intel is so behind since they put their eggs in the RDRAM basket
<BR>
(which has size limitations, even on the i840, 1GB currently) that
<BR>
they are adopting the IIIHE chipset in a forthcoming 4-way SDRAM
<BR>
server mainboard.
<BR>
<P>Thanx again ...
