You could try XFree86-3.3.6, or maybe X 4.0.

<P><EM>&gt; In October of 1997 I bought a cluster of 16 LX164 machines.  I use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one of them as the master or &quot;head&quot; node, and do all my coding and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interactive work on that machine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; About once out of every 5 or 10 times I run &quot;startx&quot; on that machine,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it crashes hard, such that only hitting the reset button will bring it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; back to life.  It always happens before the window manager starts.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am pretty sure it's crashing during the initialization of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; X-server.  Some X-servers (Accelerated-X, for example) paint a nice,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; colorful 'X' on the screen during initialization.  The crash leaves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that image only half-painted.  With XFree86, the crash just leaves the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; screen black.  If I can get past the initialization of the X-server,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then X comes up OK and is stable.  The crashing behavior is very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unpredictable.  Sometimes I can do 20 invocations of startx (maybe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one or two per day) without crashing.  Other times it will crash as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many as 3 times in a row.  On days like that, it takes about 20 or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 30 minutes just to get the machine to bring up X, because each crash
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; causes a long fsck during the next reboot.  This is MOST annoying!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've been plagued by this problem since I got the machines.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vendor has been extremely cooperative in trying to help me solve it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sending me alternative video cards to try, etc., but nothing has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worked.  For most of the time I've had the cluster, I could do much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of my work without X, but now my need for it is increasing.  Of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; course, I could just set up an Intel box as an X-terminal, and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will if don't fix this soon, but that would complicate my life in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other ways.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Has anyone else seen this problem?  Does anyone have any suggestions?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Below is a brief description of the machine and a short summary of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; various things I have tried.  I am also appending, as attachments, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; output of 'dmesg' and the .config file I used to compile the kernel.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks in advance for your help!

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The hardware:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     164LX motherboard, 21164a, 533MHz, 128 MB SDRAM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     2 Digital DE-500A NICs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     1 Intraserver 3140U SCSI card
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     3 SCSI hard disks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     1 SCSI tape drive (4mm DAT)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     1 SCSI CDROM drive 12X Toshiba
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     1 IDE  CDROM drive 12X Toshiba
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     1 floppy drive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Matrox Millennium II video card, 4Mb
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     300 W power supply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     The machine has lots of devices in it, which raises the possibility
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     that it's all just too much for the power supply.  So I tried
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     stripping it down to only two SCSI disks, no floppy, no tape,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     no CDROM drives, no NICs, and it would still crash on startx,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     as described above.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     I have tried two different Matrox Millennium II cards and one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Elsa Gloria Synergy with 8MB.  I have replaced the Intraserver
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     card once (for an unrelated failure), but putting in a new one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     didn't solve the crash on startx.  I have tried rearranging the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     pci cards in different slots in many combinations.  I have tried
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     two different LX164 motherboards.  I have replaced the DIMMS.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     None of that helps.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The firmware and software:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Currently I am using SRM V5.3-3 Sep 24 1998 14:02:11, freshly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     downloaded a couple of weeks ago.   I had also used 4.9-51
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     and 5.0-1.  I am using aboot 0.5-7, the one that came with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     RedHat 5.2.  I have used RedHat 4.2 and 5.2 with this machine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Currently it has a RedHat 5.2 that has had its compiler upgraded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     to egcs-2.91.66 and its kernel upgraded to 2.2.14.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     I am currently using XFree86-3.3.3.1-1.  I have tried several
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     earlier versions dating back to 1997.  I use the svga server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     for the Matrox cards and the 3DLabs server for the Elsa Gloria.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     I have also tried Metro-X 4.3.1 and Accelerated-X 4.1.2 with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Matrox cards.  The window manager is fvwm-1.24r-15, but I doubt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     that is relevant.
