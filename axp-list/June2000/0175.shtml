<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; As a last resort, if one tires of seeing those messages, one could up

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the default &quot;timeout&quot; value in the debugging locks code to wait for a

<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't look at the system console much unless there's trouble
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or I need to shut things down so I rarely look at these messages.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The key is they are not specific to boot time. I take it these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; messages indicate the hang is around 2 seconds, which makes sense
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; given I send 16MB over 100Mb Enet, which would mean PVM is sustaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; around 8MB/sec, actually quite good from my point of view. I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; surprised the other processor would have to wait while another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; processor was receiving network data. The lock must protect large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; portions of the kernel code. At some point I'll go back and try
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the 2.4.test series but not real soon.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is starting to sound familiar.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not really an expert on Linux SMP, but as I recall the coarse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; locking used in the Linux net code was largely responsible for its poor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; showing on the Mindcraft tests, in which they tested a quad processor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Intel box.  There was some discussion at the time on linux-kernel about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rewriting the net code for 2.3.  I don't know whether that happened.  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certainly hasn't been backported to 2.2.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>It happened.  Big time.  I believe DaveM's statement was that it couldn't
<BR>
get any more multithreaded than it currently is.  (Maybe not DaveM, but the
<BR>
sentiment is there...).  Just search the LKML archives for topics like
<BR>
&quot;softirq&quot; and &quot;net updates&quot;.  Neat stuff...
