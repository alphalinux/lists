<EM>&gt; I doubt it will ever get to the point where you stuff in a cd and type

<EM>&gt; &quot;setup&quot; :-)

<P>Just FYI, NT is pretty broken in this regard, too. If you don't partition
<BR>
it just right, you're screwed. It won't boot. Sometimes, it won't even
<BR>
install. At least in the Linux world there are competing distributions
<BR>
and you have a choice of installer.
<BR>
<P>(In order to set up a dual boot Linux--NT system, I boot the Linux CDROM,
<BR>
used the fdisk tool to partition the disk, boot the NT disk and use the
<BR>
partitions so made, then install Linux afterwards to get dual boot. You
<BR>
cannot install NT second and get a dual boot, and the NT disk partitioner
<BR>
is pretty bad. And this is Intel. NT/alpha is long since gone from my machine.)
