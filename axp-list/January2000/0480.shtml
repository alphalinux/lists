<P>
<EM>&gt; stuff in a cd and type &quot;setup&quot; :-)  Come to think of it, didn't the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; original Slackware installs do something like that? (then you fed it
</EM><BR>
<P>Hrmm... not that I recall.  The &quot;original&quot; Slackware required users to
<BR>
perform some pretty hefty voodoo before actual installation.  
<BR>
The deepest voodoo was when you could only check out Linux by
<BR>
cross-compiling under Minix, but that's a story for another time..
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; floppies til your fingers fell off....)
</EM><BR>
<P>No, that would be later SLS releases.  I have 80 or so floppies from 
<BR>
that era, none of which probably work.  Slackware was a welcome relief 
<BR>
because - in theory at least - you could pick and choose between 
<BR>
package sets and not have to install unnecessary stuff.  That
<BR>
was an interesting trip down memory lane.. I'm almost inspired to
<BR>
power up the old 386SX....
