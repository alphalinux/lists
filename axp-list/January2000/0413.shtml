<EM>&gt; With regards to your message at 05:03 PM 1/19/00 -0600, Wes Bauske. Where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you stated:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Yes, it did work on older cpus. Problems are problems though.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The point is Symbios is not blessed with perfection as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;several posts imply. Every piece of HW has it's good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;points and bad points. I don't recall any that worked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;perfectly, at least not initially.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;And too, Intraserver is definitely NOT the cost effective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Symbios solution. Their pricing is not competitive with at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;least 3 other equivalent boards as has been mentioned.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;They may have more of a warranty department though if that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;makes someone more comfortable. I'd rather have the extra
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;card sitting in my parts drawer though that I bought because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;they were cheaper.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe so, Wes, but they are the only vendor of this type I have found that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually seems to give a crap about Linux compatibility. They always make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sure that beta-testers get product to shake down before they ship hardware.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>OK. I should always add YMMV to my signature line.
<BR>
<P>When I said &quot;make someone more comfortable&quot;, that is
<BR>
part of what I meant. By all means, if you're uncomfortable
<BR>
slapping in a noname type part, buy brand name. I've found
<BR>
that only works sometimes, not all the time. I've found 
<BR>
IBM's service contracts to be the best in the business. 
<BR>
But, you pay for it. Compaq is also quite reasonable. 
<BR>
That's one of the reasons I have almost all DS10's 
<BR>
vs API based systems. My partner insists on name brands. 
<BR>
I've picked up a UP2000 and even with the higher clock rates, 
<BR>
it is not more cost effective than DS10's. That's a case 
<BR>
where a name brand wins. The only advantage to the UP2000
<BR>
is compute density per rack for what I do so I'll be
<BR>
sticking with DS10's for now and hoping &quot;Slate&quot; comes
<BR>
out soon as someone else mentioned previously. (I know
<BR>
API is a brand but they don't build complete systems)
<BR>
<P>By Linux compatibility, I assume you mean Alpha Linux.
<BR>
Then I would agree. But then, even WinNT Alpha suffered
<BR>
from the same issues. Underdogs don't get the money/attention.
<BR>
That's partly why they're Underdogs. If that makes someone
<BR>
uncomfortable, they might not want to consider Alpha Linux.
<BR>
<P>I don't use Alphas for desktop boxes. They sit in a corner
<BR>
doing alot of FP calculations. Intel Linux makes more sense
<BR>
for a desktop box. Even then, it's only a X terminal to the
<BR>
other systems.
<BR>
<P>YMMV
<BR>
