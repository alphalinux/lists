<P>
<EM>&gt; I don't know about everyone else, but I do know that we (Compaq)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certainly qualify as a &quot;big iron house&quot; and there are quite a few people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here that are working directly on overall performance and scalability.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've seen Alan Cox mention that IBM has released at least one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scalability-related patch (probably more), and SGI is all over the place
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with performance and scalability efforts (don't have personal knowledge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about Sun).
</EM><BR>
<P>Good, I knew there was at least one way to raise a response from the
<BR>
peanut gallery.  Implementing mpp support (the right way, the first 
<BR>
&nbsp;time around) is some tricky voodoo, which is why I keep my paws
<BR>
out of that corner of the kernel ;-) Seriously though.. it would be
<BR>
nice to see some of the code that make Solaris and Irix scale well
<BR>
(can't speak from personal experience with Tru64) across a perverse number 
<BR>
of processors integrated into Linux.  In that respect it would be better
<BR>
to have a surplus of available code than a dearth. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; So, what I'd say is: Is it happening?  Yes.  Is it happening fast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough?  Probably not. (MHO, of course).  And will it support Wildfire?
</EM><BR>
<P>Its interesting to watch these companies expand the
<BR>
population of ./arch/ by porting the kernel to &quot;unique&quot;
<BR>
architectures (S/390), but much more interesting to see 
<BR>
current development for new and upcoming products - as far
<BR>
as I know, Compaq stands alone in that regard and should be 
<BR>
applauded.
