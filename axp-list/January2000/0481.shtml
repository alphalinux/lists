Well, you seem to have mentioned that you tried a text install but it just
<BR>
went into X mode anyway? I've done several text installs with 6.1 w/o any
<BR>
trouble. How are you starting the text install? All you should need to do
<BR>
is add the 'text' flag to the end of the boot command, so from MILO,
<BR>
something like:
<BR>
<P><EM>MILO&gt; boot hda:kernels/generic.gz root=/dev/hda text
</EM><BR>
<P>also, if you have another machine you could try a serial install, then you
<BR>
won't get X!
<BR>
<P><EM>MILO&gt; boot hda:kernels/generic.gz root=/dev/hda console=ttyS0

<P><EM>&gt; RE: problem w/RH6.1I'm trying to install a fresh copy of Red Hat 6.1 on my 500 Mhz Alpha. 
</EM><BR>
It has 128MB of Ram, and I'm trying to install to a 4.3 GB SCSI drive. I get through to the graphical 
<BR>
install and it freezes up at some random point. Sometimes before it actually starts copying, but usually 
<BR>
at some random file it will just stop copying...I can move the mouse but if I click then it just stops... 
<BR>
I think it may have to do with the CD-ROM because when it freezes the access light goes on and off at equal 
<BR>
intervals until I reboot. I bought the CD off Mr. O's and I have a 12x SCSI Toshiba cdrom drive. Since RedHat 
<BR>
insists on using those Rock Ridge extentions, I can't use milo to boot off the cd [or can I? If somone has a 
<BR>
new milo...] and when I try to do a text install...choosing CD-ROM lauches X!?! I tried doing a net install...
<BR>
but my Etherlink card also freezes up [old linux problem, damn plug and play]. If anyone has any ideas on what 
<BR>
could cause the X install to freeze up like that, please let me know! Sometimes it's gotten to the point of 
<BR>
copying over 600 megs before dying but when I try to do a minimum install it still freeezes before it's done copying.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks for any help,
