<P>
I tried some experiments with RH 6.1 installer.  In particular I passed
<BR>
an option &quot;expert&quot; when starting the whole thing so I got &quot;Use fdisk&quot;
<BR>
button.  So far so good.
<BR>
<P>Note that you have to be an &quot;expert&quot; in order to perform a basic
<BR>
installation from SRM console, as fdisk is required, but
<BR>
'etc/aboot.conf' on CD does not include that option so in principle if
<BR>
you are newbie then you are screwed (and in any case do not get me
<BR>
started on this other abomination which pretends that it can be used to
<BR>
partition disks).
<BR>
<P>Ok, so I pick up 'fdisk' and continue; anaconda opens a big white window
<BR>
on my screen with an 'fdisk' title, a cursor starts blinking and that is
<BR>
about it.  The only operational button is &quot;Help&quot; which toggles on and
<BR>
off an emtpy help window.  That means that we not crashed yet but we are
<BR>
totally stuck.  There are some text consoles around but there are no
<BR>
error messages or anything else of any help.  Yes, I can start ok
<BR>
another copy of fdisk from a shell prompt (with that small catch that
<BR>
for that one has to know that it is possible to switch there and that a
<BR>
device node to work on can be found in /tmp) but I am in this game
<BR>
for a while.
<BR>
<P>This is on UX which I happen to have handy.  I just wonder if this
<BR>
piece works for somebody on some other Alpha or this is broken in
<BR>
general?
<BR>
<P>There are installation options which are actually available only
<BR>
if you add &quot;expert text&quot; to your boot command.  Oh, well...
