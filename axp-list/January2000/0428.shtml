<P>I have to admit that I fail to understand this &quot;therefore&quot; above.
<BR>
Device names and numbering used by firmware, or milo, have only weak
<BR>
relationship with what can be used by kernel.  In all Alphas which I
<BR>
have seen so far the system boots from this device from which it was
<BR>
told to boot and kernel does not have to be even located on a partition
<BR>
which will serve as a root file system.  As long as you can read it,
<BR>
i.e. at least one device which can hold it and is recognized by a
<BR>
firmware, this will do - be that some hard drive, floppy or CD.  If you
<BR>
are spooked by the fact that devices are relabelled in a boot process
<BR>
then mount your file systems by LABEL or UUID.  This works for a looong
<BR>
time even if it is rarely used ('man mount' and 'man fstab' for more
<BR>
information).
<BR>
<P>I have a system here which boots - totally different configuration in
<BR>
each case - from all three hard drives attached.  Normally it totally
<BR>
ignores all partitions on /dev/sda, when I not booted from that disk,
<BR>
unless I mount them &quot;manually&quot;.  The reason for that is that I happened
<BR>
to configure it that way.  In the past I had a disk from which one could
<BR>
boot RH 6.0 from one partition and SuSE 6.1 from another one.  So what
<BR>
is the problem here?
