Hi,
<BR>
<P>I have a floppyless multia and am currently attempting to install RH6.0.
<BR>
I am running into problems with a signal 11 during the install and I am
<BR>
using the updated ramdisk image (which I have downloaded from various
<BR>
locations with identical results). The signal 11 is occuring just as the
<BR>
&quot;scanning packages&quot; messages appears, which I find rather uncanny as
<BR>
this is where the old ramdisk image failed also.
<BR>
<P>My setup is as such. I boot the kernel with an aboot header through
<BR>
bootp and set the root directory to a nfs volume on a working i386 linux
<BR>
box. The nfs volume is a loopback mounted ramdisk image. Thus the
<BR>
command I use to boot from the SRM is:
<BR>
<P>boot ewa0 -file vmlinux.bootp -flags &quot;root=/dev/nfs
<BR>
nfsroot=192.168.0.5:/mnt/loopback2&quot;
<BR>
<P>(where 192.168.0.5 is the i386 nfs server).
<BR>
<P>I then watch the kernel boot, and am dropped into the installer where I
<BR>
select &quot;INSTALL&quot; and then &quot;CUSTOM&quot; I then struggle with disk druid,
<BR>
partition my drives, with one swap, select &quot;ok&quot;, I then format the swap
<BR>
partition and as soon as I reach the &quot;Scanning packages...&quot; screen I get
<BR>
the signal 11 and the install aborts. If I look at tty3 the last
<BR>
operation that seems to occur is the &quot;making symlink from tmp/rhimage to
<BR>
image&quot; operation - however this may be irrelevant.
<BR>
<P>I am sure I am using the new installer as it was built on May 28th 1999,
<BR>
whilst the original image contained an installer built on April 19th
<BR>
1999.
<BR>
<P>If somebody could shed some light upon this somewhat strange problem it
<BR>
would be much appreciated.
<BR>
<P>Thanks in advance,
<BR>
Dean.

Hi,</pre>
I have a floppyless multia and am currently attempting to install RH6.0.
I am running into problems with a signal 11 during the install and I am

with identical results). The signal 11 is occuring just as the "scanning
packages" messages appears, which I find rather uncanny as this is where
the old ramdisk image failed also.

<p>I then watch the kernel boot, and am dropped into the installer where
I select "INSTALL" and then "CUSTOM" I then struggle with disk druid, partition
my drives, with one swap, select "ok", I then format the swap partition
and as soon as I reach the "Scanning packages..." screen I get the signal
