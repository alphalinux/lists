Hi,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; [...] 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AGP is an issue that is being worked, both by API (UP1000 is now available
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and has an AGP slot) and COMPAQ (nothing yet, but 4X/Pro when available, IIRC).
</EM><BR>
<P>Cool. AGP 4x should be *great* for Alpha - their memory bandwith should be 
<BR>
sufficient :-) Pro extension is a must for most modern cards - just for their *power* 
<BR>
consumption. Hope to see an AGP/4x chipset soon....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; YOU could make a difference! Don't wait for other folks to do it, get access
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to a UP1000 and the cards you wish to see supported, and go at it! The XFree86
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; folks will be grateful, the axp-list folks will be grateful, you'll be a hero.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well this might sound naive, but is there really any work to do ? AGP is controlled
<BR>
via a small set of registers in the memory controller ( as of x86 chipsets - I don't
<BR>
think there exists *any* AGP Implementation outside their universe except PPC ).
<BR>
The *only* Alpha platform currently supporting AGP is the Irongate-based 
<BR>
UP1000. A quick glance at the irongate support code in 2.2.14 appears to map
<BR>
the CSR's correct including AGP. AFAIK, most of the AGP .vs. graphics card
<BR>
gets done by the card's BIOS upon POST ( GART mode, capabillities etc ).
<BR>
So, assuming the UP1000 is capable to interpret the Bios of a given AGP card
<BR>
correctly, the AGP Bus is set and mapped to some VA after the kernel comes
<BR>
up OK. From that point, is is up to XFree's device dependent stuff to talk to the
<BR>
graphics hardware in it's chipset-speak. The only thing that comes to my mind
<BR>
are some dense/sparse access issues, but I am by far not &quot;educated&quot; enough to
<BR>
even speculate...
<BR>
<P>Am I fundamentally wrong here ? Is there anything *really* missing on the kernel
<BR>
for a system of the UP1000 type ? I am really not a graphics/AGP expert, but from
<BR>
what I know ( or think to know, or .... ;-) it looks like done to me at least for
<BR>
the UP1000.
<BR>
<P>I wish I would have a UP1000 to give it a try, though 8-)
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
Kirk
