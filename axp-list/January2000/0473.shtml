RE: problem w/RH6.1I'm trying to install a fresh copy of Red Hat 6.1 on my 500 Mhz Alpha. It has 128MB of Ram, and I'm trying to install to a 4.3 GB SCSI drive. I get through to the graphical install and it freezes up at some random point. Sometimes before it actually starts copying, but usually at some random file it will just stop copying...I can move the mouse but if I click then it just stops... I think it may have to do with the CD-ROM because when it freezes the access light goes on and off at equal intervals until I reboot. I bought the CD off Mr. O's and I have a 12x SCSI Toshiba cdrom drive. Since RedHat insists on using those Rock Ridge extentions, I can't use milo to boot off the cd [or can I? If somone has a new milo...] and when I try to do a text install...choosing CD-ROM lauches X!?! I tried doing a net install...but my Etherlink card also freezes up [old linux problem, damn plug and play]. If anyone has any ideas on what could cause the X install to freeze up like that, please let me know! Sometimes it's gotten to the point of copying over 600 megs before dying but when I try to do a minimum install it still freeezes before it's done copying.

Thanks for any help,
