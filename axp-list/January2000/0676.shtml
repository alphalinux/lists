<P>
<EM>&gt; Ok I've been seeing a lot of articles lately covering Linux on PowerPC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yet NONE on Alpha... I'm guessing this is due to that ugly paper weight
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; called the icrap err imac, excuse me. I'd like to see Alpha Linux make a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; better show out there, even if I have to write the damn articles myself!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not that anyone want's to read what I have to say (I'll know by how many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people reply to this ;-). What do you all think? Anyone interested in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; writing an article about ANYTHING related to Linux on Alpha? Maybe we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can get Rich to put something up on the AlphaLinux.org site? Anything?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anyone? Or have I gone off the DEEP end?!? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I obviously can speak only for myself :-)
<BR>
I write articles for a german Unix magazine ( called UnixOpen ) on a regular
<BR>
basis. Although this is not my main job, it rapidly consumes more and more
<BR>
of my time. I have already in the past done *several* articles on the
<BR>
Alpha arch in general, as well as running Linux on Alphas - you
<BR>
guessed right: Alpha *is* my personal favorite arch and Linux is among
<BR>
my favorite OSes. Currently, I am doing a rather big article series
<BR>
on the UP2000 covering EV6, the Tsunami chipset, Linux &amp; NetBSD and a 
<BR>
performance comparison with an Athlon based machine.
<BR>
I cannot really comment on the situation in the US, but I assume it is not
<BR>
really that much different compared to Germany. 
<BR>
The mainstream Linux is definitely with x86, so most of the overall press
<BR>
coverage goes into this. In addition, most articles cover things like
<BR>
installation and comparing various distributions. Personally, I've never
<BR>
seen too much sense in this approach, mainly for the following reasons:
<BR>
1. People do not install Linux every day, they rather tend to run it, once
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is installed :-)
<BR>
2. Honestly, most distributions are alike. They run the same kernels, most 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the apps are the same and I would regard the differences between
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rpm, dpkg and the like to be of minor importance in a production
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;environment.
<BR>
<P>I found the main reason for the lack of coverage on alternative archs
<BR>
to be the lack of competent Editors. You'll find a *lot* of people
<BR>
writing articles about how great their Linux runs on a 500Mhz Pentium-II,
<BR>
that is overclocked to 501Mhz - yes, I too think that sucks. But you
<BR>
are in *serious* trouble, if you want to find someone covering things like
<BR>
the difference between ARC and SRM. Back in 1997, I wrote an article
<BR>
about the PC164, which was fairly new at that time. Among a lot
<BR>
of other things, it contained infos about which PCI cards run on that
<BR>
board and how easy it was to set up a decent system using that board
<BR>
with standard PC-type peripherals and how easy it was to get Linux
<BR>
on this machine. I was stunned by the amount of reader-feedback we
<BR>
got for this article. People were amazed to learn, that running an Alpha
<BR>
is really not bizarre black-magic. The very same was repeated for
<BR>
the SPARC arch - with the same result. Based on the boatload of 
<BR>
x86-based systems being shoved through my home-office for testing,
<BR>
I know almost as well as anybody else on the mailing-list, how much
<BR>
more advanced about *any* other architecture is ( I confess - I did
<BR>
PC mainboard devel for a big taiwanese company in one of
<BR>
my previous lives... ). Although the x86 chips got *a lot* better in the
<BR>
past three or four years, the chipsets and mainboards are still crap
<BR>
( or are you telling me, that there is a *technical* advantage in
<BR>
having a 64bit memory-bus in a system running two Pentium-III 
<BR>
at 800Mhz ).
<BR>
Based on my experience in that past years, finding a competent
<BR>
techwriter is the main problem for about anything that is not
<BR>
x86 or MS. It is definitely *not* the lack of interest in the reader
<BR>
base of any decent computer mag.
<BR>
I *strongly* suggest, that anybody being interested in writing stuff
<BR>
for things like Linux-Alpha should approach a magazine with that
<BR>
idea. As stated above, I can only speak for Germany, but I cannot
<BR>
believe, that it is that much different in the US.
<BR>
<P>As a popular commercial stated: Just do it.
<BR>
