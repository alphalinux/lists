I started out w/ a RH6.0 AS200 (SRM) and attempted to load up
<BR>
SuSE6.3.  That was a bad idea.  After I found a kernel on the cd 
<BR>
that would support the scsi host, I built the box.  I couldn't
<BR>
load a kernel from anything but a cd or a dos-ish floppy.  That was
<BR>
after I'd thrown in the towel and flashed ARC on it.  I ended up
<BR>
reloading from scratch with RH6.1 using the same kernel parms you
<BR>
mentioned...something like 'expert text root=/dev/fd0' or thereabouts.
<BR>
(thanx to Praveen for getting me that far).  The Alpha's are
<BR>
absolutely killer boxes, and the support for them here is excellent.
<BR>
I'm glad they're not being ignored by the distro folks,
<BR>
but it would sure be nice to see a bit more support from them.
<BR>
Like Michal said, a newbie wouldn't stand a snowball's chance in
<BR>
Hell getting an axp up with the current distros.  Sorry about the
<BR>
rant, but it took way too long to get that box back up.

<EM>&gt; I tried some experiments with RH 6.1 installer.  In particular I passed

<EM>&gt; an option &quot;expert&quot; when starting the whole thing so I got &quot;Use fdisk&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; button.  So far so good.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Note that you have to be an &quot;expert&quot; in order to perform a basic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installation from SRM console, as fdisk is required, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'etc/aboot.conf' on CD does not include that option so in principle if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you are newbie then you are screwed (and in any case do not get me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; started on this other abomination which pretends that it can be used to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; partition disks).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ok, so I pick up 'fdisk' and continue; anaconda opens a big white window
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on my screen with an 'fdisk' title, a cursor starts blinking and that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about it.  The only operational button is &quot;Help&quot; which toggles on and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; off an emtpy help window.  That means that we not crashed yet but we are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; totally stuck.  There are some text consoles around but there are no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; error messages or anything else of any help.  Yes, I can start ok
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; another copy of fdisk from a shell prompt (with that small catch that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for that one has to know that it is possible to switch there and that a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; device node to work on can be found in /tmp) but I am in this game
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for a while.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is on UX which I happen to have handy.  I just wonder if this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; piece works for somebody on some other Alpha or this is broken in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; general?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are installation options which are actually available only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you add &quot;expert text&quot; to your boot command.  Oh, well...
