<EM>&gt;   Okay. I have a pc164 linux box here, with an isa ne2000 card, a sb16
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isa card, and a few other pci cards. In other words, all of my isa slots
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are taken up. I have only one slot left, a pci.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   The problem is this. I want to set up masquerading on this box so when I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; go adsl in a week, the machines on my lan can get out. That means that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need to have two ethernet cards in here, but I've only got the one is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ne2000.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   So. I'm at an empasse. Do I chunk a soundblaster 16 card that works
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; flawlessly in this box for a cheap pci sound card and install an old isa
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SMC ethernet card in the slot that I free up, or do I go out and buy a pci
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ethernet card?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   I would prefer to conform to the analogy &quot;if it ain't broke, don't fix
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   My question : what good, _cheap_ (cheap = under $50) pci ethernet cards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are out there that will work on alphas? I don't need a swiss army card.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is just a cheesy home lan that has an ancient mac, this box, and an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ancient r6k on it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Failing that, there are loads of super super cheap sound cards out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there. This sb16 is about 5 years old. What chipsets on pci sound cards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Buy a Netgear FA310tx and install the latest Tulip driver
<BR>
from Becker's site and you should be OK. They typically
<BR>
go for $20-$25 around here. There are other noname type
<BR>
cards in the same price range but the chipsets vary alot.
<BR>
I've seen the rtl8139/via-rhine/winbond/MX. Someone else
<BR>
should know if they work. I believe a via-rhine will but
<BR>
when I bought the card, the driver was still flakey. The
<BR>
MX chipsets should work with Tulip. Anyone seen an MX chipset
<BR>
that doesn't work?
