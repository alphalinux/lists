I did not have any problem doing a fresh 6.1 install on a xlt300 once I
<BR>
yanked the Matrox card out of it and installed a s3 generic card. For
<BR>
some reason the 2mb Matrox card that was in the system was being detected
<BR>
as a 4mb one. Guess what the screen looked like?? I should mention I don't
<BR>
do any &quot;X&quot; on this machine, She just does firewalling ....
<BR>
Doing raid1 on two 9.1 gig ibm scsi-3 drives hooked up to a Buslogic 958
<BR>
(scsi ultra 20mb). Root wont &quot;raid&quot; but everything else will fine.
<BR>
System boots off of the internal ncr controller with the 1.2 gig drive it
<BR>
came with. Once Milo loads it sees the rest of the drives and then loads
<BR>
them via raid.
