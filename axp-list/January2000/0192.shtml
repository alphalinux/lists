<P>It is also, if I'm not mistaken, a Rock Ridge image (since Rock Ridge is
<BR>
just a convention for ISO9660-formatted disks to represent Unix-style
<BR>
files and directories).  So I think what Steve is asking for is a disk
<BR>
that, when mounted under WinNT, has all the long filenames and file
<BR>
permissions that a Unix system would see.  This could be a Joliet
<BR>
disk (WinNT's extended ISO9660 format) or a disk mounted with a Rock
<BR>
Ridge-compatible WinNT filesystem utility, or a Linux utility that
<BR>
can write ISO9660 with Joliet extensions.
<BR>
<P>If you look at a Rock Ridge disk from an ISO9660 perspective, files all
<BR>
have DOS-style 8.3 names, but there are special files that allow these
<BR>
to be translated into Unix-style names, permissions, and directories.
<BR>
<P>Joliet is similar, except it has added Microsoft attributes, lacks some
<BR>
Unix attributes, and is completely (and unnecessarily) incompatible with
<BR>
Rock Ridge.  It, too, uses ISO9660.
<BR>
<P>One other solution that I'd really like to see is a bootable CDROM
<BR>
that has a RAM-based Linux system set up as a ready-to-run FTP server.
<BR>
(Are you listening, RedHat?)  This would allow people in Steve's
<BR>
situation to simply boot such a disk on a free WinBox without the need
<BR>
to do a local install, leaving the WInBox's hard disks untouched.
