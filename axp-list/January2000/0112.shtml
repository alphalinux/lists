Hi,
<BR>
<P>1 of the most important things for me as an AlphaLinux user
<BR>
is to get em86 working.  Unfortunately, the way it's documented ( or
<BR>
rather not documented ), I've been unable to do so.  I've gotten all
<BR>
kinds of errors, some of which have occured to other people as well (
<BR>
from searching the archives ).  However, I haven't seen a single
<BR>
posting in the archive which would outline the steps.  The only
<BR>
thing I saw was &quot;if you have the right libraries, it'll work&quot;, which
<BR>
is not helpful to me, because I've tried all combinations of libraries.
<BR>
So I'm almost ready to beg, could someone please who was able to install
<BR>
version 2.2.0 on RH 6.1 ( or similar ), outline the steps necessary to
<BR>
get it working.  It really has to be a FAQ ( it kinda is right now,
<BR>
but all it does is point to a grossly outdated digital ftp site ).
<BR>
<P>Thanks a lot in advance
<BR>
<P>Igor
