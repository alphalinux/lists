<P>
The issue I have is with an Intel
<BR>
EtherPro (10MB) not being recognised.
<BR>
Perhaps I am not going through all the
<BR>
steps needed.  It was added after the
<BR>
install, 
<BR>
and selected during &quot;make xconfig&quot; when
<BR>
I built the new kernel.  Boot up says it
<BR>
cannot find the 
<BR>
eth1 card.  What steps should I take to
<BR>
view the card?  Also, it seems my other
<BR>
network card (Tulip - &quot;built-in&quot;) is not
<BR>
being reconised at boot either, although
<BR>
during shutdown it sees it.

<P>Absolutely.  In particular if you have
<BR>
an ISA sound card then it is more
<BR>
likely to give you less troubles than a
<BR>
PCI counterpart.  Especially PCI
<BR>
sound card manufactures seem to be
<BR>
guilty assuming that their cards will
<BR>
only work with Wintel machines and
<BR>
&quot;cutting corners&quot; from PCI standard
<BR>
which later bite on Alpha.
<BR>
<P>ISA ehternet cards also work fine
<BR>
although these are truly rare
<BR>
animals nowadays (probably from a drawer
<BR>
with old rejects).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is there work being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; done on it or is it a lost cause?

<P>Do you have in mind something like
<BR>
Adaptec AHA152X ISA SCSI controllers?
<BR>
These devices have serious troubles
<BR>
independently on a platform and
<BR>
I doubt if anybody will spent much time
<BR>
fighting their quirks;
<BR>
especially that documentation, AFAIK, is
<BR>
practically unavailable.
