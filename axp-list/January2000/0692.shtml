<P>
<EM>&gt; From: Larry Snyder &lt;larrys@lexis-nexis.com&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Some disjointed thoughts -- some may be useful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Reassurances that linux support won't go the way of NT would probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be a good thing too.  The recent thread re: hpa and Ted T'so pretty much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; says that there are some top-level developers outside of compaq that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aren't giving up on it.  Compaq's release of an rpm (with free libs) of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; netscape hasn't hurt, either.
</EM><BR>
<P>A few things that come to my mind:
<BR>
1. Compaq could consider giving the Linux-Alpha Dist-makers the *right*
<BR>
to bundle their compilers. Having RedHat, Suse or Debian shipping the
<BR>
Compaq compilers with the Dists is a good idea. Not too many Alpha
<BR>
users will actually take advantage of the freely available compilers
<BR>
otherwise - few even *know* about them.
<BR>
2. Compaq could put effort behind GCC, to improve codegeneration
<BR>
on the Alpha. I actually looked into this quite some time ago, but I didn't
<BR>
get too far, due to lack of time.
<BR>
3. Fund development of open-source apps. Although you can get
<BR>
Staroffice for free and Applix cheap, you will most likely not see
<BR>
a commercial company funding development of Linux-based apps
<BR>
outside the x86 world. I know that Applix is doing an Alpha version,
<BR>
but not Staroffice. It is reallt becoming a two-class world out there.
<BR>
You get Linux on x86 everywhere with cheap/free apps. But far less
<BR>
for Alphas. This is a bad situation.
<BR>
<P>What is actually needed ( IMHO ) is a platform like the 164LX running a
<BR>
21164PC. A cheap but yet fast enough entry-level Alpha, sold through
<BR>
the very same channels as the PC stuff is. Something like the UP1000,
<BR>
but priced as agressively as the DS10. I would *love* to see an
<BR>
implementation of the 21264 with on-chip 128 or 256k L2-Cache like
<BR>
the Pentium-III, but no expensive external Cache. That beast would free
<BR>
production from the - rather expensive - Slot-module. True, it would not
<BR>
be as good as a UP2000/DS20, but still good enough and cheap.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The other thing to think about is where you publish.  The Alphalinux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; platform is a small enough player that perhaps the best initial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; audience would be existing x86 linux users.  LJ? /.?  ALO is a great
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; site, but would be preaching to the choir (maybe not a bad idea). 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The AlphaNT bunch also comes to mind....
</EM><BR>
<P>Splatter press coverage on Alpha everywere ! 
<BR>
Don't even *think* you're able to judge who is reading what mag.
<BR>
Imagine a UP1000 with 750Mhz 21264, a DDR-GeForce AGP
<BR>
graphics card, optimized MVI supported GL implementation would
<BR>
kick ass on Quake framerates. Publish this in an ordinary games mag.
<BR>
This would spread word of Alpha being *the* superior platform more
<BR>
than any beowulf cluster ever could. 
<BR>
Note: I am *not* into games at all ( I am too slow :-). But have a look
<BR>
what people are actually looking for. The *outside world* is sometimes
<BR>
strange ;-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; HTH,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; -ls-
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, just my .02
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
