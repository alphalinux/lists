<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I don't know about everyone else, but I do know that we (Compaq)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; certainly qualify as a &quot;big iron house&quot; and there are quite a few people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; here that are working directly on overall performance and scalability.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I've seen Alan Cox mention that IBM has released at least one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; scalability-related patch (probably more), and SGI is all over the place
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with performance and scalability efforts (don't have personal knowledge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; about Sun).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Good, I knew there was at least one way to raise a response from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; peanut gallery.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hey - I resemble that remark! ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Implementing mpp support (the right way, the first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  time around) is some tricky voodoo, which is why I keep my paws
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out of that corner of the kernel ;-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Eh, not really voodoo - it just takes a lot of thought, and even more good
<BR>
design.  The more that I work with both Tru64 and Linux, the more I see good
<BR>
ideas and bad ideas, and good ideas gone bad.  Linux is set up pretty well,
<BR>
but there are still a good sum of areas where we assume that we're running on
<BR>
a small PC with one user in front of it, or maybe a small workgroup server.
<BR>
We're getting there, tho'. :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Seriously though.. it would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nice to see some of the code that make Solaris and Irix scale well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (can't speak from personal experience with Tru64) across a perverse number
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of processors integrated into Linux.  In that respect it would be better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to have a surplus of available code than a dearth.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup.  Can't say I could agree with anything more than that paragraph.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; So, what I'd say is: Is it happening?  Yes.  Is it happening fast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; enough?  Probably not. (MHO, of course).  And will it support Wildfire?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Its interesting to watch these companies expand the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; population of ./arch/ by porting the kernel to &quot;unique&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; architectures (S/390), but much more interesting to see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; current development for new and upcoming products - as far
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as I know, Compaq stands alone in that regard and should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; applauded.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Glad to hear it (and so are the three &quot;J&quot;s, I'm sure :).  Hopefully we'll be
<BR>
providing some of that surplus of code soon enough...:)
