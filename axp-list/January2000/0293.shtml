<P>
I think a lot of us are really curious as to the current status of em86.
<BR>
Occasionally someone asks, but the message goes unanswered.
<BR>
<P>Would someone from Compaq care to give us an update???
<BR>
<P>The speed at which em86 can run things like WordPerfect is very impressive.
<BR>
The fact that em86 can't properly create or write files makes it rather useless,
<BR>
however.  I think I speak for many people when I say that a properly working
<BR>
em86 would be a *very* valuable asset.  Good for Alpha/Linux, good for Compaq,
<BR>
and great for all of us.  It would expand our software base considerably,
<BR>
which is a Good Thing.  Please don't inadvertently force me to make it a new
<BR>
personal project.  I have enough on my plate right now, but I just hate seeing
<BR>
such potential as em86 go to waste.
<BR>
<P>So please someone, Compaq, ANYONE, tell us the deal!
<BR>
<P>Thank you,
<BR>
-Mark
