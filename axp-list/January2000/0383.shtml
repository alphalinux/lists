<P>
In response to 2940UW W/ multiple drives:
<BR>
this was my original setup on my 164SX @ 533MHz
<BR>
as soon as more than one drive was accessed at a time the thing would puke
<BR>
and reset the SCSI bus indefinately.... never tried it with just one drive,
<BR>
but it looks to be a problem of multiple drive accesses at the same time.
<BR>
Also, their auto-termination never worked quite right either.
<BR>
<P>my solution:
<BR>
get new cards =)
<BR>
I have a DigitalScappe DataStorm32+ (no longer made) which is U2W and is
<BR>
based on the NCR/ SYM 83c975 chipset.... rock solid... only problem was
<BR>
that it 300+
<BR>
<P>so if you want something cheaper, and don't need U2W, www.compgeeks.com had
<BR>
an LSI SYM83c875 (I think) for under $50 plus shipping in their drives
<BR>
section. That will get you all the functionality in linux that you have
<BR>
been lacking and it is rock solid.
<BR>
<P><P>most of my drives are on the LSI controller and I haven't had a problem
<BR>
with it. I think I'm up to 12 or so devs on it
<BR>
<P>one more thing... DON'T try using those 68-&gt;50 pin converters for older
<BR>
drives to put them on the same chain as the rest of the wide drives. I've
<BR>
had nothing but problems doing this. Best bet is to cable them on their own
<BR>
dedicated 50 pin cable from the same controller....
<BR>
<P>good luck!
<BR>
