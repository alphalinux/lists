I used to work in data center operations at a major oil company, and I
<BR>
once had a meeting with a very intersting man - a Technology Specialist
<BR>
who was responsible for deciding things like &quot;How do we save all these
<BR>
documents for 25+ years&quot; without turning a small state into a warehouse
<BR>
facility? He was concerned with:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Media life (how long will the tape/CD/optical disk,etc. be usable?)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Availability of suitable readers (CD ROM drives in 20 years? How
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about a papertape reader for data from the 60's? And those funky
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;optical disks from the early 80's?)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Availability of software to read the media and translate it to current
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;machine?
<BR>
<P>Ask yourself this - how many corporations have warehouses full of
<BR>
long-term archives stored on reel tapes, yet no longer have suitable drives
<BR>
to recover the data from? I came to find out from my friend that the
<BR>
US Gov't. has a &quot;museum&quot; of sorts full of old tape readers for just such
<BR>
an incident...
<BR>
<P>Neat stuff, glad it isn't my problem...

<P><P><EM>&gt;&quot;accelerated testing&quot; ? I saw the 30 year claim ( for those $79 tapes which
</EM><BR>
is
<BR>
<EM>&gt;approx tha price of an 8gig IDE drive). exactly where does it say that
</EM><BR>
anyone
<BR>
<EM>&gt;tested it at all? I'd love to see the media last that long, so long as the
</EM><BR>
drive
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&amp; circuit technology also lasts some 30 years ( fat chance huh - probably
</EM><BR>
also be
<BR>
<EM>&gt;too slow for my grand-kids, should they like to look at some 25 year old
</EM><BR>
data
<BR>
<EM>&gt;:-/).
