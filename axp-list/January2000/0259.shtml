<P>
You're not the only one having problems with sound Pete. My system has been
<BR>
acting odd with sound now for quite some time...
<BR>
currently it's kernel 2.2.13 w/ the sound drivers as modules.
<BR>
runs the sound card fine for a few hours typically and then dsp stops
<BR>
working.... midi still works fine though
<BR>
<P>can unload and then re-load the modules to no avail
<BR>
<P>this is on a 164SX w/ 256MB ram (between 2 slots)
<BR>
sound card is an SB AWE32
<BR>
NIC is a DEC 21140 clone (actually Bay Networks, but the DEC chipset)
<BR>
Video is a Diamond Stealth 64 video VRAM w/ 2MB
<BR>
SCSI is a SYM 83c875 and a DigitalScape 32+ (SYM 83c895)
<BR>
+/- 60GB of SCSI space spread out between 10 drives
<BR>
32x Toshiba CDROM
<BR>
4x TEAC CDR
<BR>
<P><P>currently running AlphaBIOS 5.7 and RH 6.0
<BR>
<P>any ideas?
<BR>
thanks
<BR>
Kurt
