<EM>&gt; &gt; Their cards are now used in most of the Alphas made by Compaq.

<EM>&gt; &gt; They are VERY well made, and have the best support in the business.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have no idea about their support 'cause I haven't needed it. I replaced

<EM>&gt; my Adaptec with an Intraserver card and *all* my stability problems went
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; away.

<P>I have 2940UW's 3940w's, 2940's, Tekram's, noname 810's,
<BR>
Digitalscape 895's, Qlogic's. All work fine in Linux. ALL have
<BR>
been fussy at one time or another about the drivers in Linux.
<BR>
The key is to find the correct driver version for each card. 
<BR>
<P>While Symbios cards are less likely to have problems, they still
<BR>
do have them. Anyone who uses them on a 21264 should have went
<BR>
thru it recently with timeout issues and not being able to even
<BR>
boot. Check this list's archives for info.
<BR>
<P>Qlogic appear to be unable to drive CD-RW drives, a Yamaha 4416
<BR>
in my case. Even with newer kernels. They run disks fine.
<BR>
<P>So, it depends on careful handling of drivers. The other
<BR>
issue is firmware levels on the cards. All my Adaptecs are
<BR>
pretty old, over 2 years, other cards have been acquired
<BR>
over the past 2-3 years.
<BR>
<P>Now, the question is should you spend the time finding the
<BR>
correct level of firmware and drivers? That depends on you.
<BR>
Tekram DC390F's are half the price of an Intraserver card,
<BR>
around $75. Someone else mentioned an 875 based card for $60.
<BR>
Which is more valuable to you, your time to find things or
<BR>
just junking the 2940UW and spending an additional $75??
<BR>
<P>Unless I were going Tru64, I don't think I'd pay the premium
<BR>
for an Intraserver card.
<BR>
<P>Just my $.02.
