OK, FWIW I've just finished putting my packages for October-Gnome on
<BR>
alphalinux.org
<BR>
<P>I presume they will be available to the wider public when the guys
<BR>
there decide they're fit for wider consumption.
<BR>
<P>These packages were built on my EV56.  If, like me, you don't know or
<BR>
understand the implications of this, don't be surprised if you look
<BR>
silly if/when they don't work. 
<BR>
<P>Sean
<BR>
<P>NOTE: Although I am an experienced C programmer, I am not an Alpha
<BR>
god.  I am also _seriously_ overworked.  Anyone who has problems with
<BR>
these packages I will endeavour to help as much as I can, but it would
<BR>
be as well if all problems/complaints/patches etc were sent (or at
<BR>
least CC'd) to the list, as there are _many_ people who would be able
<BR>
to help more than I.  For example, Michal and Rich between them have
<BR>
at least four more brains than I have ;)

<EM>&gt; You can upload them if you wish. Peter can just put a disclaimer in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dir that these were compiled on an ev56.

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Which machine did you compile them on? I compiled a hefty chunk of them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; but as PCA56...which would leave out some users.

<EM>&gt; &gt;

<EM>&gt; &gt; I did it on a Ruffian.  D'you want 'em?

<EM>&gt; &gt; All usual disclaimers apply.  They did seem to work, although I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; found a few little problems.  Michal sent me a patch for something,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which I'll apply and then recompile the relevant bits if there is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sufficient interest.  I posted here about it when I first did it, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; noone seemed very bothered, so I crawled back into my shell.
