<EM>&gt; Now the problem was, that MILO and Linux don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agree on the scan direction, MILO puts the 3 HD-Chain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first and the 4 HDs behind it. Linux does it the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other way round (where Linux=Redhat6.1 with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Kernel 2.2.13).

<P>You are actually seeing a difference between PCI scan order
<BR>
in 2.0 and 2.2 Linux kernels.  Most milo executables around
<BR>
are based on the former.  This scan order was changed to be
<BR>
the same as the one used by BIOS; at least in most cases.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So is there an option or so to reverse on of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; two?
</EM><BR>
<P>Surprisingly enough it will be 'pci=reverse'; or find milo
<BR>
recompiled with 2.2 code.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I tried two Adaptec 2940AU first and those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were detected in the same order by milo and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the kernel, but they wouldn't work reliably.
</EM><BR>
<P>If that is the case, and this was the same milo/kernel pair,
<BR>
then something had to be quite strange with a PCI scan in that
<BR>
situation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Another problem were the new ext2-options. After
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scratching my head and searching the mailinglist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I finally found that creating the root-fs with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;mke2fs -b 1024 -O none /dev/sda1&quot; makes it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; readable by milo.
</EM><BR>
<P>'sparse_superblock' can be modified with a help of tune2fs and fsck;
<BR>
block size is fixed in a time of a creation of a file system.  Once
<BR>
again - you are seeing a difference between 2.0 and 2.2 kernels
<BR>
as new file system attributes are not supported by older kernels.
<BR>
Booting from a small partition, which will be created with a block
<BR>
size 1024 by default in any case, is a good idea regardless.  Milo
<BR>
will get an indigestion if your kernel to load happens to be
<BR>
positioned further than 2 GB offset from a partition start.
