<P><EM>&gt; A few things that come to my mind:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1. Compaq could consider giving the Linux-Alpha Dist-makers the *right*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to bundle their compilers. Having RedHat, Suse or Debian shipping the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Compaq compilers with the Dists is a good idea. Not too many Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; users will actually take advantage of the freely available compilers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; otherwise - few even *know* about them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed, that would be a big plus, problem is I think they require people
<BR>
to pay for commercial use?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2. Compaq could put effort behind GCC, to improve codegeneration
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the Alpha. I actually looked into this quite some time ago, but I didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get too far, due to lack of time.
</EM><BR>
<P>You may not have seen this but API has been working with Cygnus on this,
<BR>
the fruits of that deal should be out fairly soon.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3. Fund development of open-source apps. Although you can get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Staroffice for free and Applix cheap, you will most likely not see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a commercial company funding development of Linux-based apps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; outside the x86 world. I know that Applix is doing an Alpha version,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but not Staroffice. It is reallt becoming a two-class world out there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You get Linux on x86 everywhere with cheap/free apps. But far less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for Alphas. This is a bad situation.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's difficult for something like StarOffice because Sun now owns it, and
<BR>
I somehow expect that Alpha isn't on their list of platforms to port to.
<BR>
However if they were to release the source like they promised several
<BR>
months ago......
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What is actually needed ( IMHO ) is a platform like the 164LX running a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 21164PC. A cheap but yet fast enough entry-level Alpha, sold through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the very same channels as the PC stuff is. Something like the UP1000,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but priced as agressively as the DS10. I would *love* to see an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implementation of the 21264 with on-chip 128 or 256k L2-Cache like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Pentium-III, but no expensive external Cache. That beast would free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; production from the - rather expensive - Slot-module. True, it would not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be as good as a UP2000/DS20, but still good enough and cheap.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The other thing to think about is where you publish.  The Alphalinux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; platform is a small enough player that perhaps the best initial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; audience would be existing x86 linux users.  LJ? /.?  ALO is a great
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; site, but would be preaching to the choir (maybe not a bad idea). 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The AlphaNT bunch also comes to mind....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Splatter press coverage on Alpha everywere ! 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Don't even *think* you're able to judge who is reading what mag.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Imagine a UP1000 with 750Mhz 21264, a DDR-GeForce AGP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; graphics card, optimized MVI supported GL implementation would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kick ass on Quake framerates. Publish this in an ordinary games mag.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This would spread word of Alpha being *the* superior platform more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than any beowulf cluster ever could. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Note: I am *not* into games at all ( I am too slow :-). But have a look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what people are actually looking for. The *outside world* is sometimes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strange ;-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; HTH,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; -ls-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again, just my .02
