<P>
<EM>&gt; I'm not sure I would like to see workstation-class hardware (read: SGI,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DEC/Compaq, Sun) &quot;going for a wider appeal.&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Workstation users, by and large, have money to spend -- and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; performance and price tag of these machines reflect that. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Expand into the corporate market, and you have to compete with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IBM, Dell and the like. Doable. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you want to push further, perhaps into the home market, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; especially into schools .. you have to start making boxes _cheap_ ..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real cheap. Just like we have &quot;generic&quot; shit box Intel motherboards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with buggy chipsets, we'd start seeing that sort of thing coming out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; workstation makers. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, so you are saying that they designed these chips to be &quot;workstation&quot;
<BR>
class and thus not for mass market appeal?  Hummmm . . . perhaps so.  I
<BR>
guess that's why they are always in need of corporate investment.  Their
<BR>
market isn't big enough to support their efforts?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; iMac's aren't aimed at companies, they are aimed at individuals. Every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; case that I own is either airbrushed with funky designs, or covered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with stickers and logos; or both. Corporate beige sucks. And, who the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hell wants a big beige box in their home. Home users need a machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that doesn't look garish in their living room -- now whether a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tangerine iMac fits the bill or not is a matter of taste -- but I'm not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in a position to judge; like I say stickers and airbrushed madness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mark my machines. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I understand your response, however, I was simply making the point that
<BR>
the real money is not with the individual but with the corporate sale.
<BR>
Think about it.  How many of the computers in your house are from your
<BR>
company?  Your laptop, your spouses laptop, perhaps even a machine or two
<BR>
that you &quot;borrowed&quot; from the company to do &quot;work at home&quot;.  If you are not
<BR>
a computer junkie then you most likely have only one personal machine that
<BR>
does your bills and let's you cruise the net.  The point is, in my
<BR>
opinion, the average household contains more company hardware than
<BR>
personal hardware.  However, given the demographics of this list, the
<BR>
results from the list members may show the reverse trend.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Alone, the look of the machine won't sway me: that's where my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; girlfriend's airbrush and talent come in; but the look of a machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would play a roll if I was on the fence between one or more machines. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Girlfriend's airbrush?  That's cheating.  How can you refuse your girl?
<BR>
Anyway, if all things were equal, price would be my deciding factor, not
<BR>
color or design of the case.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Everyone I know who isn't a computer geek who has a computer do one of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; two things with it: stick it in an out of the way room, or put it in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one of those folding computer cabinets so you can't see it when not in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use; because computers look stupid. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm sure that's true.  Most don't like to be seen as the family &quot;geek&quot;.
<BR>
It's un-cool.  However, that person usually makes the best bucks.  Go
<BR>
figure.  Anyway, I display mine without issue.  To me, they are machines
<BR>
that &quot;do work&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Most people wouldn't leave a cardboard box filled with books sitting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in their living room; even if they love the books -- put whatever you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like inside the box, and when you look at it, you still want to get it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out of the room! Computers are the same way, and they even LOOK like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cardboard boxes... with a few notable exceptions; the iMac being one.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, but I guess I see machines differently.  I don't care how they look
<BR>
as look as they fill the requirements and are within my price range.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Personally, I don't like the look of the iMac much -- but I'm still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thinking of picking one up and throwing Yellow Dog Linux on it :)
</EM><BR>
<P>You know . . .  was thinking of picking one up too.  However, mine would
<BR>
be for accounting.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, this is one man's point of view . . . .
<BR>
