<EM>&gt; &gt; Again, being more business and scientific-minded, I agree.  Games are a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; distant fourth behind business, scientific/reseach, and network appliance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; applications.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A box which is **really** good at games will likely be also pretty good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at scientific visualization and widely understood CAD.  Ok, so sound is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only a pleasant diversion but bus capabilities can be essential to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things like broadcasting and video processing.  I look at games in this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; context as a not bad test case.  An experience also shows they tend to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drive up a market pretty well. :-)  But myself I am not indeed a big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; game user.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>To add my $.02.
<BR>
<P>Ask yourself how many businesses would buy N boxes based 
<BR>
on looking at a game? I certainly wouldn't. See how odd 
<BR>
that sounds??? A business selecting a box because it can 
<BR>
waste an employee's time?? I know you say it means performance
<BR>
in other areas are good too but that is exactly the point. 
<BR>
You sell based on the other areas to businesses, not games.
<BR>
<P>Not to say I don't use games occasionally to relieve stress
<BR>
but it has nothing to do with my business.
<BR>
<P>What I'd like to see is more compact packaging so I can get
<BR>
densities similar to the current Intel 1U cases. I'm not
<BR>
interested in SMP boxes particularly but a 2/4 way in the
<BR>
same space as a DS10 would be of interest, assuming similar
<BR>
price points.(I'd pay 2x/4x what a DS10 costs for them)
<BR>
Otherwise, 1U DS10's would work OK too.
<BR>
<P>For my line of work, cheap, dense, compute clusters are the
<BR>
way to go. I've got a UP2000 on order but I suspect the
<BR>
slot B cartidge is a mistake. It looks huge. Assuming the
<BR>
board can be put into a 3U rack mount case, it has my 
<BR>
attention though. Then I get 2 cpus for the same rack space 
<BR>
as a DS10. That alone would half the foot print of a large 
<BR>
configuration. Still like DS10's too though.
<BR>
<P>I'd be surprised if Compaq felt the home market was their
<BR>
target. Why sell a $2000-$5000 cpu and $2000+ motherboards
<BR>
if that were the target audience? Even the UP1000, at around
<BR>
$700 for board and $2000 for the processor doesn't compare
<BR>
to current PC prices. It's around 2-4 times more expensive.
<BR>
Home users won't have much interest and that's who might
<BR>
actually care about whizbang game performance.
<BR>
<P>As a poll, how many people on this list own a 21264 based box
<BR>
for your home use??
<BR>
<P>I don't but I sure use them for production work.
