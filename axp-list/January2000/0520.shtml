<EM>&gt; axp-list about this, about 50 minutes :)

<P>50 minutes? I'll try harder next time. ;-)

<P><EM>&gt; I was told that they just followed the directions on alphalinux.org to

<P>What version of the libs is it? I tried using the ALO instructions for
<BR>
4.0d and 5.0, but it needed more libs then what was listed in the FAQ.

(BTW I created a step by step version of the FAQ for 4.0d libs, if you
<BR>
want a copy to use to update the FAQ contact me in private).
