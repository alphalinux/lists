<P>
<EM>&gt; Why go with a non-Intel compatible instruction set, unless you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tweaking performance for the niche user's. With a &quot;non-standard&quot; CPU
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you are begging for MS (read: intel-centric) to be unable to port their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; code to you, and you are begging for a portable system like UNIX to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be the lifeblood of your CPU line. 
</EM><BR>
<P>This is true only if you want a business desktop and not a education,
<BR>
research, development, or engineering workstation.  This is the Mips/Alpha
<BR>
niche.  What I'm saying is that there may not be enough market there.
<BR>
Also, with the cash that Intel puts into research, if the SGI's and DEC's
<BR>
of the world cannot keep up, the Intels will crush them.  Intel promises a
<BR>
Ghz chip with a &gt; 133 Mhz bus speed by the end of the year.  They are also
<BR>
working on their own RISC processor.  If AMD keeps up the pressure, Intel
<BR>
will, sooner or later, overtake some, if not all, of the workstation class
<BR>
EOM's.
<BR>
<P>Economies of scale, my dear peers, faster, cheaper, easy to obtain, lots
<BR>
of software, multiple target markets.   Hummm . . . sounds like Intel,
<BR>
huh?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As it turned out, as far as I can tell, MS helped keep the workstation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; class hardware alive by not introducing a viable UNIX solution.  
</EM><BR>
<P>This is because Micro$loth wants to push UNIX out of the server and
<BR>
mid-tier market with a version of Windows.  I believe, as time passes,
<BR>
Windows will mutate into something very UNIX-like at the backend while
<BR>
maintaining the inefficient but user friendly front end.
<BR>
<P>Who will win?  Who knows . . . .  The UNIX philosophy or Bloatware?  It's
<BR>
our choice.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; High-end users want UNIX and fast CPUs .. they couldn't get a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; full-blown UNIX on Intel at all so the speed question was irrelevent.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think Linux, FreeBSD, SCO, and others do offer a full-blown UNIX.  Only
<BR>
the most bleeding edge high availability is not available for Linux but
<BR>
that is in the pipeline.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Sun was able to carve out a market. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, but it was development workstations and Internet (mid-tier) servers.
<BR>
This is not mass appeal but it's not bad.  Sun definitely has an edge over
<BR>
everyone else in Internet servers.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Enter Linux and BSD -- now you can get a full blown UNIX compatible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system on Intel hardware; and the question becomes how much speed do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you want, and how much coin do you have. Do you _really_ need an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; UltraSparc's performance, or will a PII and Linux do the job at a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fraction of the cost?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, my point exactly.  HP offers the Brio line now.  Marry one of those
<BR>
machines with Linux and you have a decent Internet server for under
<BR>
$1,000.00.  Now that's bang for the buck.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; When you have loads of cash, Alphas and Sparcs make sense: they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perform better, but cost more. The price/performance of the Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't come into play in my book, because the Intel machines have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; longer lifespan.
</EM><BR>
<P>I look at price/performance if all others things are equal.  This would
<BR>
include using the same software on each (Ex. Apache), same type of OS
<BR>
(ex. Linux or Solaris), the same netwrk bandwidth (ex. 10 or 100 BaseT),
<BR>
same disk architectures and sizes (ex. 9.1 GB Ultra SCSI II), etc.  If I
<BR>
can get 1 CPU per U of rack space, I'm pretty happy.
<BR>
<P>For my money, the 1U and 2U, rack mountable, 1 or 2 CPU, high availability
<BR>
servers based on Intel and Linux or FreeBSD are probably the best bang for
<BR>
the buck for Internet or Intranet servers.  By the end of the year there
<BR>
will be 900+ Mhz based servers or even a Ghz based server on the market
<BR>
for far less that you can get Sun Ultra 250/450/3000/3500/etc, HP
<BR>
L1000/2000, HP N4000, or any other RISC processor servers.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; When the engineers want a PIII on their desk, you can take their PII's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and trickle them down to the technicians, or the secretaries once they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are a generation or two behind. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In the long run, you can save a lot of money with Intel machines. They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cost less up front, and two generations from now they can be put into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fine service as office machines. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Again . . . Exactly.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You're right -- and corporations use lots of office products: enter MS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Office and the supremacy of Intel.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, hence their ability to offer a cheap product.  Again, economies of
<BR>
scale.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Were I to try and take market share away from Intel while still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aiming for the high-end user, I'd probably make a line of chips
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with a superset of Intel's instruction set.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not exactly.  Remember the Linux phenomanon.  We have emulators for
<BR>
Windows and DOS but how many actually use them.  I sure don't.  I like
<BR>
UNIX and it's variants.  It think they are most efficient and get the job
<BR>
done.  The point being, you can go up against WinTel with something like
<BR>
LinTel, UltraLinux or AMDLin, etc, if you have the marketing strategy and
<BR>
the force of will.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Maybe get nuts and do vector processing in hardware. :) The engineers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scientists and the hard-core games will take a serious look at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; platform, dump some capital in Id and other game makers to accelerate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for my CPU, and I'm in a position to make money. 
</EM><BR>
<P>My bets are on the engineering, research, and development shops instead of
<BR>
the gaming shops.  Sorry, it's just my own point of view.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The money is with corporations; so you have to make a product that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gets touchy-feely with a corporations one nerve ending: its bottom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; line. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Indeed. I have 4 machines up and running right now (read: _running_
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now) and I have 7 operational machines total (plus loads of parts) one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machine comes from my &quot;employer&quot; (its not a real job, its an internship
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but thats irrelevent :) 
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds like me and most of the gang here . . . .  However, we are
<BR>
engineers and not &quot;normal people&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Well, I'm on the other end.. but I have tatoos, wear my hair like a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 14th century Samurai, and am never seen without (rather decorated)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leather jacket. So, I'm out in the extreme tail anyhow.. it only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; makes sense that my machines look weird.  :)
</EM><BR>
<P>HA!  The funny thing is, whether you wear a 3 piece suit and a marine
<BR>
haircut or a ponytail, earings, and a leather jacket, our industry
<BR>
tolerates it because we want intellegence, motivation, self-starting,
<BR>
inovative, independent thinkers that can &quot;get the job done&quot;.  We don't
<BR>
want, just another &quot;yes-man&quot; in a suit.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Indeed. Ultimately I am in the same category -- I tack on decoration
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as an afterthought, really -- but for the people who treat computers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like home appliances, they'll buy a CD deck that matches the rest of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their stereo..
</EM><BR>
<P>HA!  Yep.  To each her own.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In my mind it is a decent strategy by Apple: their market is a niche
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mac-lover market to begin with, highly individualist by nature, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they are preserving the share that they have, and maybe make some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; waves and get new customers: we are both talking about buying one. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not saying that they should not stay with their niche market.  What
<BR>
they should so is offer some PowerPC looking boxes for corporate use.
<BR>
Make sure that the basic software exists for it and then push it as the
<BR>
corporate alternative to &quot;Evil Bill Gates&quot;.  As long as they refuse to
<BR>
offer cheap computers can cannot be connected to corporate LANs they will
<BR>
not be a real player.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Plus, this is how Apple operates; they aim to the individual. Remember
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their Big Brother ad? &quot;Think different.&quot; .. thats their gimmick.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Whether it is enough to sell machines or not is another question,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personally, were I Apple, I'd take my own advice and &quot;Think different&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; .. but hey.. who the hell am I .. I'm just a poor college kid with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tatoos .. :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, right.  The poor college kid with tatoos that will be making more
<BR>
than most of his peers if he is motivated, smart, keeps an eye on the
<BR>
industry, and has a plan for his future.
<BR>
<P>Just ramdom thoughts . . . .
