<P>Actually I'm running the default gnome/enlightenment setup. one major

difference between my 6.0 and 6.1 setup is I  have esound running (and

actually working ) in 6.1 .  Still running stock kernel.

<P><EM>&gt; After KDE locked up I can still login over a network to a stricken

<EM>&gt; this moment is 'shutdown -r' or the situation will deteriorate quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fast.  Visual effects on a console, until a machine starts to reboot,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are quite interesting. :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Can't say I've seen that happen though the last time I ran KDE was
<BR>
with my own compiled stuff on 6.0. When I still used milo. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Actually my other version of KDE, which runs on Alpha over basically 5.2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distribution with updates and qt-1.4 libraries, behaves in a similar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; style; only it takes a bit more of effort to crash it.  No, I do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have the slightest plans to even try to debug this big blob of C++.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I run a few KDE applications from Gnome/Enlightment combo, but not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the whole environment, and so far nothing bad happened.
</EM><BR>
<P>At first I suspected it was the font server so I disabled it. Then it
<BR>
crashed when I was running x11amp for no apparent reason.  That doesn't
<BR>
appear to be the problem.  I might just try running 6.0 and just tweak
<BR>
it.  Thanks Michal.
