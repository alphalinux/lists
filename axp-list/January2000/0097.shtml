<EM>&gt; Speaking of sound drivers has anyone tried ALSA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support? Does it work any better than whats included in the kernel?

<P>A while ago I tried Trident PCI sound card.  For this one I really
<BR>
needed ALSA driver so I could not tell anything about &quot;better&quot;.
<BR>
It worked fine on UX with 256MB of RAM but I could not get a peep
<BR>
when dropped into UP2000.  Nothing was crashing but interrupts
<BR>
were obviously not processed and after a while I was getting a timeout
<BR>
on every attempt to play something. I cannot tell what was really
<BR>
at fault.
<BR>
<P>In general, from some other experiences, I have more confidence in
<BR>
ALSA drivers but I did not see enough of that on Alphas to rank there
<BR>
various sound setups.
