    I'm new at Linux, just used NT before.  I'm trying to start the 
Red Hat 6.0 for 2 weeks now.  The installation runs with no problems and 
the "/tmp/install.log" file shows that all packages were installed without 
errors.  To be sure that the X Window settings are not the blame I choose 
the simplest screen settings and to start without X Window at booting.  
The computer reboots and I use the command: 
        MILO> boot hda2:/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.5-16 root=/dev/hda2 
It starts to boot and stops randomly at different stages.  Sometimes it 
gives as many as 17-20 [OK]s and stops at "Starting keytable".  I use 
"Ctrl-Alt-Del" or "Reset" and boot again - is stops after maybe 2 [OK]s.  
I'll give you some examples of the stages at which it stops 
and "does nothing": 
    "Activating swap partitions", 
    "Loading default keymap", 
    "Freeing unused kernel memory: 168k freed", 
    "Finding module dependencies", ............
I reboot and it stops at another stage.  Sometimes it stops and invites me 
to use my root password.  I get in as "root" and do not know what to do.  
That's how I could consult the "install.log" file and find out that the 
installation went well.  

My configuration is: AlphaPC164LX, 533MHz, 128MB SDRAM, 
HDD-IDE Quantum Bigfoot, Matrox Millenium II, ...
    The disk is partitioned using fdisk (during installation) in 3 "primary" 
partitions: P1=2MB-DOS, P2=800MB-Linux native, P3=120MB-swap.  It's a very 
slow and corrupt IDE-disk: Quantum Bigfoot TX8.0AT 7665MB 69kB cache.  It 
has many bad blocks, but I observed that the first 1000MB are pretty good, 
that's why I have chosen so small partitions at the beginning of the disk.  
And of course I choose at every new installation to format the disk with 
bad blocks check.  
    The Red Hat distribution is not on a genuine CDROM, but an ftp-copy of 
the distribution on the Red Hat site.  
                                      Thank you in advance, Nick
