</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; real cheap. Just like we have &quot;generic&quot; shit box Intel motherboards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with buggy chipsets, we'd start seeing that sort of thing coming out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; workstation makers. 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Ah, so you are saying that they designed these chips to be &quot;workstation&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; class and thus not for mass market appeal?  Hummmm . . . perhaps so.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guess that's why they are always in need of corporate investment.  Their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market isn't big enough to support their efforts?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, basically -- lets face it; even a decade ago anyone could see the
<BR>
writing on the wall: Intel makes the CPUs, and Microsoft makes the OS. 
<BR>
If you want to have a shot at mass-market appeal, your chip better run
<BR>
Intel code -- throw in other bells and whistles if you like to get
<BR>
high-end users.
<BR>
<P>Why go with a non-Intel compatible instruction set, unless you are
<BR>
tweaking performance for the niche user's. With a &quot;non-standard&quot; CPU
<BR>
you are begging for MS (read: intel-centric) to be unable to port their
<BR>
code to you, and you are begging for a portable system like UNIX to
<BR>
be the lifeblood of your CPU line. 
<BR>
<P>As it turned out, as far as I can tell, MS helped keep the workstation
<BR>
class hardware alive by not introducing a viable UNIX solution. High-end
<BR>
users want UNIX and fast CPUs .. they couldn't get a full-blown UNIX
<BR>
on Intel at all so the speed question was irrelevent. Sun was able to
<BR>
carve out a market. 
<BR>
<P>Enter Linux and BSD -- now you can get a full blown UNIX compatible
<BR>
system on Intel hardware; and the question becomes how much speed do you
<BR>
want, and how much coin do you have. Do you _really_ need an UltraSparc's
<BR>
performance, or will a PII and Linux do the job at a fraction of the cost?
<BR>
<P>When you have loads of cash, Alphas and Sparcs make sense: they perform
<BR>
better, but cost more. The price/performance of the Alpha doesn't come
<BR>
into play in my book, because the Intel machines have a longer lifespan.
<BR>
<P>When the engineers want a PIII on their desk, you can take their PII's
<BR>
and trickle them down to the technicians, or the secretaries once they
<BR>
are a generation or two behind. 
<BR>
<P>In the long run, you can save a lot of money with Intel machines. They
<BR>
cost less up front, and two generations from now they can be put into
<BR>
fine service as office machines. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I understand your response, however, I was simply making the point that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the real money is not with the individual but with the corporate sale.
</EM><BR>
<P>You're right -- and corporations use lots of office products: enter MS
<BR>
Office and the supremacy of Intel.
<BR>
<P>Were I to try and take market share away from Intel while still aiming
<BR>
for the high-end user, I'd probably make a line of chips with a superset
<BR>
of Intel's instruction set. Maybe get nuts and do vector processing in
<BR>
hardware. :) The engineers, scientists and the hard-core games will take
<BR>
a serious look at the platform, dump some capital in Id and other game
<BR>
makers to accelerate for my CPU, and I'm in a position to make money. 
<BR>
<P>The money is with corporations; so you have to make a product that gets
<BR>
touchy-feely with a corporations one nerve ending: its bottom line. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However, given the demographics of this list, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; results from the list members may show the reverse trend.
</EM><BR>
<P>Indeed. I have 4 machines up and running right now (read: _running_ now)
<BR>
and I have 7 operational machines total (plus loads of parts) one machine
<BR>
comes from my &quot;employer&quot; (its not a real job, its an internship but thats
<BR>
irrelevent :) 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Everyone I know who isn't a computer geek who has a computer do one of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; two things with it: stick it in an out of the way room, or put it in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; one of those folding computer cabinets so you can't see it when not in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; use; because computers look stupid. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm sure that's true.  Most don't like to be seen as the family &quot;geek&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's un-cool.  However, that person usually makes the best bucks.  Go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; figure.  Anyway, I display mine without issue.  To me, they are machines
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that &quot;do work&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I'm on the other end.. but I have tatoos, wear my hair like a 14th
<BR>
century Samurai, and am never seen without (rather decorated) leather
<BR>
jacket. So, I'm out in the extreme tail anyhow.. it only makes sense that
<BR>
my machines look weird.  :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yeah, but I guess I see machines differently.  I don't care how they look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as look as they fill the requirements and are within my price range.
</EM><BR>
<P>Indeed. Ultimately I am in the same category -- I tack on decoration as an
<BR>
afterthought, really -- but for the people who treat computers like home
<BR>
appliances, they'll buy a CD deck that matches the rest of their stereo..
<BR>
<P>In my mind it is a decent strategy by Apple: their market is a niche
<BR>
Mac-lover market to begin with, highly individualist by nature, so they
<BR>
are preserving the share that they have, and maybe make some waves and
<BR>
get new customers: we are both talking about buying one. 
<BR>
<P>Plus, this is how Apple operates; they aim to the individual. Remember
<BR>
their Big Brother ad? &quot;Think different.&quot; .. thats their gimmick. Whether
<BR>
it is enough to sell machines or not is another question, personally,
<BR>
were I Apple, I'd take my own advice and &quot;Think different&quot; .. but hey..
<BR>
who the hell am I .. I'm just a poor college kid with tatoos .. :)
