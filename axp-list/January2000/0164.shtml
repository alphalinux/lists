<EM>&gt; Old and new DEC/Compaq and SGI hardware are excellent but they were not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; marketed well.  They niched themselves instead of going for a wider 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appeal.  Intel, with IBM's and Micro$loft's help, became the &quot;chip for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the corporate world&quot;. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure I would like to see workstation-class hardware (read: SGI,
<BR>
DEC/Compaq, Sun) &quot;going for a wider appeal.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Workstation users, by and large, have money to spend -- and the
<BR>
performance and price tag of these machines reflect that. 
<BR>
<P>Expand into the corporate market, and you have to compete with
<BR>
IBM, Dell and the like. Doable. 
<BR>
<P>If you want to push further, perhaps into the home market, or especially
<BR>
into schools .. you have to start making boxes _cheap_ .. real cheap. 
<BR>
Just like we have &quot;generic&quot; shit box Intel motherboards with buggy
<BR>
chipsets, we'd start seeing that sort of thing coming out of workstation
<BR>
makers. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Apple just doesn't seem to get it.  Tangerine and Blueberry iMacs?  Good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; God! ...  Stop with the cute cases and spiffy colors.  Greys and tans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are just fine. Personally, the color of the case is not going to sway
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me one way or another.
</EM><BR>
<P>iMac's aren't aimed at companies, they are aimed at individuals. Every
<BR>
case that I own is either airbrushed with funky designs, or covered with
<BR>
stickers and logos; or both. Corporate beige sucks. And, who the hell
<BR>
wants a big beige box in their home. Home users need a machine that
<BR>
doesn't look garish in their living room -- now whether a tangerine
<BR>
iMac fits the bill or not is a matter of taste -- but I'm not in a 
<BR>
position to judge; like I say stickers and airbrushed madness mark my
<BR>
machines. 
<BR>
<P>Alone, the look of the machine won't sway me: thats where my girlfriend's
<BR>
airbrush and talent come in; but the look of a machine would play 
<BR>
a roll if I was on the fence between one or more machines. 
<BR>
<P>Everyone I know who isn't a computer geek who has a computer do one of
<BR>
two things with it: stick it in an out of the way room, or put it in 
<BR>
one of those folding computer cabinets so you can't see it when not in
<BR>
use; because computers look stupid. 
<BR>
<P>Most people wouldn't leave a cardboard box filled with books sitting
<BR>
in their living room; even if they love the books -- put whatever you
<BR>
like inside the box, and when you look at it, you still want to get it
<BR>
out of the room! Computers are the same way, and they even LOOK like
<BR>
cardboard boxes... with a few notable exceptions; the iMac being one. 
<BR>
<P>Personally, I don't like the look of the iMac much -- but I'm still
<BR>
thinking of picking one up and throwing Yellow Dog Linux on it :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Does anyone know what company pumped 200 million dollars into Apple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recently?  Answer: MicroSloth!  No prizes for figuring out why!  :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm.. that is interesting.
