<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. I have a pc164 linux box here, with an isa ne2000 card, a sb16
<BR>
isa card, and a few other pci cards. In other words, all of my isa slots
<BR>
are taken up. I have only one slot left, a pci. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is this. I want to set up masquerading on this box so when I
<BR>
go adsl in a week, the machines on my lan can get out. That means that I
<BR>
need to have two ethernet cards in here, but I've only got the one is
<BR>
ne2000. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So. I'm at an empasse. Do I chunk a soundblaster 16 card that works
<BR>
flawlessly in this box for a cheap pci sound card and install an old isa
<BR>
SMC ethernet card in the slot that I free up, or do I go out and buy a pci
<BR>
ethernet card?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I would prefer to conform to the analogy &quot;if it ain't broke, don't fix
<BR>
it.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My question : what good, _cheap_ (cheap = under $50) pci ethernet cards
<BR>
are out there that will work on alphas? I don't need a swiss army card.
<BR>
This is just a cheesy home lan that has an ancient mac, this box, and an
<BR>
ancient r6k on it. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Failing that, there are loads of super super cheap sound cards out
<BR>
there. This sb16 is about 5 years old. What chipsets on pci sound cards
<BR>
work? 
<BR>
