<P>
Stumbled across a little kludge from years ago that I'd
<BR>
forgotten about until this evening.
<BR>
<P>Switched from mingetty to getty earlier today, and pulled up
<BR>
/etc/gettydefs to tweak the settings.  Noticed that the
<BR>
default line speed for the virtual consoles (type VC) was
<BR>
still set at 9600.  Smirking, I changed it to 230400
<BR>
and restarted init.  Its not like that should change anything.
<BR>
Logged back into that terminal, and text seemed to pop up much
<BR>
quicker.. something I attributed to the strong coffee.
<BR>
<P>I have a large assortment of aliases and shortcuts I pull along to
<BR>
whichever environment I'm using.  One I use frequently under bourne
<BR>
lists subdirectories of the directory you're in (usually piped to
<BR>
more/less):
<BR>
<P>alias lsd=&quot;ls -la|grep dr.x|awk -F'     ' '{print $2}'|sed s/^.*\ //g|\
<BR>
sort -rn&quot;
<BR>
By all means, feel free to copy if you find it useful.
<BR>
<P>The smirk got wiped off my face when calling the lsd alias while
<BR>
playing an mp3.  Without fail, &quot;lsd&quot; in one directory with 95
<BR>
subdirectories causes the audio to skip while sorting the results.  Not
<BR>
this time.  The results jumped to the screen as soon as I executed the
<BR>
command.  Other noticable speed increases were in lynx and displaying
<BR>
man pages.  I'd determined a baseline load of 0.05 for trivial tasks
<BR>
(vim, mpg123, lynx) at the console with 4 active ttys - it has dropped
<BR>
to 0.00/0.01. 
<BR>
A few cycles are wasted 'slowing down' the console to whichever speed
<BR>
it was spawned at.  The closer you sync the framebuffer and
<BR>
processor, the more responsive your system feels - simple stuff. 
<BR>
<P>Looks like the BSD guys already picked up on this &quot;common sense&quot;
<BR>
kludge - from /etc/gettytab, FreeBSD:
<BR>
P|Pc|Pc console:\
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:ht:np:sp#115200:
<BR>
<P>If you also use the console, I hope you find this tip new and useful.
<BR>
At the very least.. nethack/angband/etc. will appear more responsive ;-)
