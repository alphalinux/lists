<EM>&gt; Hummm . . . maybe but we will have to overcome the high level of inertia
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of X11.  I'm not sure that X11 can do what is required to bring a GUI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Desktop that the novice can use.  Remember the UNIX tenets stated in &quot;The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; UNIX Philosophy&quot;.  UNIX is not easy to use because it can do so many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things and is very efficient.  They technical level of UNIX users is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; higher, by and large, than their Windows/MacOS counterparts.  Get the book
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and read it.  I think there is a new edition of the book out that has soom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; updates expounding upon more current events.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree. After reading this book it suddenly became quite clear what the
<BR>
differences are between Windows/Mac and *NIX. After I installed RedHat
<BR>
6.0 on my Cabriolet and Intel boxes I thought to myself.....'I think we
<BR>
are loosing site of the tenets'. (I did opt for some major bells and
<BR>
whistles too.)
<BR>
<P>I can see where development of games, browsers, and other 'goodies' will
<BR>
benefit the overall in the future. Don't rule them out, keep them as a
<BR>
choice.
<BR>
<P>As long as those interested in slim efficient boxen have a choice I
<BR>
don't have an issue. When it becomes necessary to use KDE or other large
<BR>
GUI's I probably will take issue. When I have to add 25% more RAM to run
<BR>
the OS I'll probably take issue.
<BR>
<P>If we are not careful we'll find ourselves duplicating what MS has done.
<BR>
A very large inefficient OS.
<BR>
