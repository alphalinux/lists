<EM>&gt; &gt; Like Michal said, a newbie wouldn't stand a snowball's chance in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Hell getting an axp up with the current distros.  
</EM><BR>
<P>I did not say that.  Actually I can imagine a hardware/firmware
<BR>
configuration on which &quot;point-and-click-aren't these pictures
<BR>
nice&quot; installation would work.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I wouldn't say all the current distro are screwed. I've done several
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installs of Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 (slink) from scratch, each one worked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the first try.
</EM><BR>
<P>Various things will work, in different places, &quot;on the first try&quot;.
<BR>
I did some succesful installations of RH 6.1 and even tried to
<BR>
&quot;play dumb&quot; - although with the later I was less lucky.  At least
<BR>
it does not crash on a broken 'librpm' which is a progress. :-)
<BR>
<P>The more disturbing is a general trend in Linux installation utilities
<BR>
for better and better hiding tools which you may need when things will
<BR>
stray from a prescribed scenario.  They are still there but if you do
<BR>
not know where to look then you may find out yourself facing greyed out
<BR>
both &quot;Next&quot; and &quot;Previous&quot; arrows and now what?  This is not a property
<BR>
of a particular platform or distribution.  Yesterday &quot;Linux Today&quot; had a
<BR>
link to a review in which its author was smitten by an installation
<BR>
utility from Mandrake 7.0.  A comment from a reader pointed out that on
<BR>
his machine an attempt to use this installer become a minor nightmare, a
<BR>
big headache and a huge screwup. YYMV.
<BR>
<P>I am getting also more and more careful about possible loss of data
<BR>
(&quot;express install&quot; anyone? :-).   I was playing with &quot;Update
<BR>
installation&quot; a little bit and it &quot;updated&quot; ___with the same versions___
<BR>
some 180 MB of perfectly installed packages modifying various
<BR>
configuration files in the process. That after I walked manually a list
<BR>
of packages to update and verifying that none is chosen. Sigh!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Although I didn't try booting from the CD, just made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 3 floppy disks and used the CD as the source... 
</EM><BR>
<P>It did boot where I tried.  With SRM firmware you can get away
<BR>
with no floppies at all.  This may lull you in a false sense of
<BR>
security, but this is another story. :-)
