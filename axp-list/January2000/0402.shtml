<P>
With regards to your message at 05:03 PM 1/19/00 -0600, Wes Bauske. Where 
<BR>
you stated:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Yes, it did work on older cpus. Problems are problems though.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The point is Symbios is not blessed with perfection as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;several posts imply. Every piece of HW has it's good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;points and bad points. I don't recall any that worked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;perfectly, at least not initially.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And too, Intraserver is definitely NOT the cost effective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Symbios solution. Their pricing is not competitive with at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;least 3 other equivalent boards as has been mentioned.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;They may have more of a warranty department though if that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;makes someone more comfortable. I'd rather have the extra
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;card sitting in my parts drawer though that I bought because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they were cheaper.
</EM><BR>
Maybe so, Wes, but they are the only vendor of this type I have found that 
<BR>
actually seems to give a crap about Linux compatibility. They always make 
<BR>
sure that beta-testers get product to shake down before they ship hardware.
<BR>
<P>I believe you when you say that you can make other cards work well. As long 
<BR>
as one has the experience, time, and ability it will likely be possible.
<BR>
<P>If, however, I want a solution that just works out of the box, no doubts, 
<BR>
and good quality, I still can say the ITI stuff fits the bill. And I have 
<BR>
built a LOT of alpha boxes over the years.
<BR>
<P>All I know is that while not always the cheapest we use the ITI cards on 
<BR>
the Alpha boxes we build for our customers because it is just one more way 
<BR>
to ensure there are no &quot;issues&quot;.
<BR>
<P>And the other thing I know is that 2/3rds of the time I hear the word 
<BR>
&quot;Adaptec&quot; is in a sentence that is a complaint.
<BR>
<P>Understand that I own no shares from Intraserver (pity, they just took all 
<BR>
their staff to Disney World this week for a vacation) and praise them 
<BR>
because they have made my life easier over the years.
<BR>
As for the support praise, I remember about  3 to 4 years ago when I spent 
<BR>
a Friday night working on a Digital UNIX database server field upgrade. I 
<BR>
was adding a RAID array, and used an ITI card. Unfortunately UNIX was being 
<BR>
&quot;difficult&quot; on the aging 2100 server I was upgrading. The techs at ITI 
<BR>
spent their Friday night handholding and helping me get this box up and 
<BR>
running. Two of their  people( who I know work the day shift) spent their 
<BR>
Friday night on the phone with me. After we saw that we had the problem 
<BR>
solved one of them gave me his home number &quot;just in case&quot;. And they 
<BR>
INSISTED they call me back and put the phone charges on their bill.
<BR>
<P>I have to respect that.
<BR>

<BR>
