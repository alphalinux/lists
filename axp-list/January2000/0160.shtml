<P>
Dan,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't get suckered into thinking that games are irrelavent. 
<BR>
<P>1) Some games require a working, optimized 3D enviornment.  Many
<BR>
scientists would benefit from being able to use this to look at their
<BR>
climate data, genetic data, financial data in new ways.
<BR>
<P>2) Most games demand full resources, and work the system hard. Any
<BR>
program that stresses many elements of the system (network, graphics,
<BR>
sound) will find bugs that affect programs in other areas.
<BR>
<P>3) Most games require real-time like response.  Any program that requires
<BR>
such a reponse will benefit from problems fixed by working on a game.
<BR>
<P>Games are a fun way to make sure of all the above works. 
<BR>
<P>As for the demo, I think that Alpha has the potential to wow the
<BR>
crowd.  A nice quick, graphical program (such as a game) would make
<BR>
it really obvious that it is a fast little box. ;-)

<EM>&gt; The same question we (ALO) were asked by API last year.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Funny how everything comes around in time ;-) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 	What is your dream of the Alpha/Linux future? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Clusters for scientific computing and rendering farms, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dedicated systems for networking, telecomm (telephony 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  under Linux is really taking off!) and signal processing, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; general-purpose scientific workstations...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; One thing I would love to see is a rocking Alpha/Linux game/demo page. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not me.  Besides the hack value, what would it accomplish? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; We have source to games (Quake, descent, doom, heretic).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; We have source to the Voodoo chipset drivers. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I would love to have a knock-your-socks off graphic demo that I could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; use to show off the alpha.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've been using Un*x for a decade, Linux for 7 years, and have a keen 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dislike for most graphics.. so what I'm about to say might be biased.   
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When I decided to go with Alphas, the first thing that came to mind 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was not &quot;Gee, I hope this thing runs [game] fast&quot;.  The majority of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organizations and individuals using Linux on Alpha for real work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably only care about the performance of one or two applications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; critical for day-to-day operations.  Focusing energy on improving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; game performance under Linux/axp tells me you'd like to sucker in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people whose use for a computer could be better served by a game
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; console.  Don't get me wrong.. I think it's a nice afterthought 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to have some slick games under Linux, but the having the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first impression of &quot;Wow, it runs Quake.&quot; is probably not constructive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If Compaq or API plan to introduce a low-end Alpha box with fast 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; graphics and a &lt; $1500USD price tag targeted at home users and use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suped-up video games to market it, more power to them.  I just feel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that showing off video games on a $5k+ system is a bit silly ;-)
