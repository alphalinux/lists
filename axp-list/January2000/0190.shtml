<EM>&gt; Ask yourself how many businesses would buy N boxes based 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on looking at a game? I certainly wouldn't. See how odd 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that sounds??? A business selecting a box because it can 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; waste an employee's time?? I know you say it means performance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in other areas are good too but that is exactly the point. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You sell based on the other areas to businesses, not games.
</EM><BR>
<P>Probably no one would buy a system for serious use by just
<BR>
looking at games. But looking over the &quot;fence&quot; towards SGI
<BR>
helps. On every computer show, they ususally show off some
<BR>
fancy, colourful moving/flipping/rotating graphics demo.
<BR>
In effect, that gave them the reputation of being *the* graphics
<BR>
company.
<BR>
Now, Imagine, one would use a recent x86-world 3D games 
<BR>
accelerator on an alpha. Make people aware, that
<BR>
the grahpics used on the machine is some top-dog PC
<BR>
graphics ( like Nvidia's GeForce256 with DDR Ram ).
<BR>
Now port Quake to it. Use a GL, that makes use of all the
<BR>
funny 264 features: fully pipelined FP, NVI instructions etc.
<BR>
<P>Put that system right *next* to a top-end x86 System using the
<BR>
*same peripherals* ( important - same graphics ). Run the
<BR>
timedemo on both and see the Alpha fly.
<BR>
<P>Now what ? I admit, that this demo will probably not sell a
<BR>
*single* system to a coorperate customer, but it will generate
<BR>
the perception of alpha being a superior platform among the
<BR>
game-kidies. magazines will love to see a system like that 
<BR>
being some sort of  top-end-games-reference machine.
<BR>
Give it as a free loaner for testing to the &quot;pc-mega-games&quot;
<BR>
magazine ( or whatever they are called ).
<BR>
<P>You catch a trend here - the *only* reason, the average user
<BR>
is buying a faster x86 machine is for games. No one with some
<BR>
brains would claim, that you need a 30+ SPECint95 800Mhz
<BR>
Athlon to run Word or Excel.
<BR>
<P>True, marketing is a *weird* thing. Wrong, I'm not into it ;-)
<BR>
But it sure makes sense demoing such a beast on trade shows.
<BR>
<P>Besides, I am not into games at all - I am far too slow to 
<BR>
handle Quake and friends - just do not have the reflexes.
<BR>
I still stick to nethack and C when it comes to recreation :-)
