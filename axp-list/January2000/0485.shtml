<EM>&gt; The more disturbing is a general trend in Linux installation utilities
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for better and better hiding tools which you may need when things will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stray from a prescribed scenario.  They are still there but if you do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not know where to look then you may find out yourself facing greyed out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; both &quot;Next&quot; and &quot;Previous&quot; arrows and now what?  This is not a property
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of a particular platform or distribution.  Yesterday &quot;Linux Today&quot; had a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; link to a review in which its author was smitten by an installation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; utility from Mandrake 7.0.  A comment from a reader pointed out that on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his machine an attempt to use this installer become a minor nightmare, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; big headache and a huge screwup. YYMV.
</EM><BR>
<P>IMHO nobody, except a newbie to Linux/Unix, is *really* pleased by
<BR>
a GUI-based installation. The other day, I installed NetBSD on my 
<BR>
Alpha and liked their attitude of hiding nothing behind a fancy
<BR>
installer. If I were to put something on a &quot;todo&quot; wishlist, it would
<BR>
be an &quot;expert type&quot; installation, which offers partitioning the
<BR>
bootdrive, put bootstuff om place and dump the minimal system onto 
<BR>
it from an ordinary tarball. For the individual add-on package selection,
<BR>
a package manager like 'rpm' or 'dpkg' is ok. 
<BR>
I once did a minimal installer for RH.41 doing the above and I am *very*
<BR>
tempted doing it again for the 6.x series.
<BR>
<P>Also, we have to face the fact, that Alpha users are a tiny minority
<BR>
compared to the x86 world. Look at the docs of RedHat 6.1-Alpha
<BR>
and judge by yourself how much it would make sense to you if it
<BR>
would be your first time doing an install on an Alpha. With things
<BR>
being scattered all over places and the general attitude of &quot;shoot first - 
<BR>
RTFM later&quot; ( which I share, honestly :-) you are almost guaranteed
<BR>
to loose. 
<BR>
I know, there is excellent doc in various places ( SRM howto, Milo Howto,
<BR>
mailing-lists like this one, www.alphalinux.com ) but somehow most of
<BR>
the Redhat's, SuSe's and Debian's of this world fail to compile them
<BR>
into their Docs in a convenient way.
<BR>
<P>Don't get me wrong, I love Linux and what the Distributions have done
<BR>
to get it onto your machine - but sometimes I think they are &quot;fixing&quot;
<BR>
the wrong problem with the GUI stuff.
<BR>
<P>Just my $ 0.02.
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
Thomas Weyergraf - still being impressed by the movie &quot;The sixth sense&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which I've seen today. Highly recommended.
