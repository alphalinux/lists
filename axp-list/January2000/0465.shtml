<P>
i recently installed on an XLT300.  i had to try the install about 5 times
<BR>
becuase the redhat installer kept randomly crashing in different parts of
<BR>
the install.  it dumped me into the python debugger ....
<BR>
<P>i also found that a number of features of the installer did not work (such
<BR>
as hitting F1 for info on a package).  there were problems with parts of
<BR>
the screen not being cleared when they should (especially during package
<BR>
selection).  and strangely, it didnt even try to do the graphical isntall
<BR>
(not that i'm really complaining).
<BR>
<P>about the only thing i'm willing to say about the redhat install is that
<BR>
it's fairly broken on alpha, and you have to be an expert to do it anyway
<BR>
:)
<BR>
<P>hopefully others have had better experiences than i ...
