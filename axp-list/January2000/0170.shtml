<EM>&gt; 	Don't get suckered into thinking that games are irrelavent. 
</EM><BR>
Phil, there is a fine line between games and graphics demos.  
<BR>
The games you have in mind are not relevant outside of the home 
<BR>
entertainment market which is dominated by Wintel and game consoles. 
<BR>
Demos have a broader spectrum but lack the plot, interactivity 
<BR>
(to a degree) and replay value of games.  They do what they were
<BR>
coded to do - show off the features of a graphics engine at 
<BR>
the highest possible resolution. 
<BR>
<P>High-end SGI boxes I used to work with came with several demos 
<BR>
for everything from the RE to the Cave.  They were fun things to 
<BR>
play around with, but you'd never hear one of the researchers gasp 
<BR>
in delight at the prospect of seeing the skyfly or crayonland demos 
<BR>
for yet another time.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2) Most games demand full resources, and work the system hard. Any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; program that stresses many elements of the system (network, graphics,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sound) will find bugs that affect programs in other areas.
</EM><BR>
Oh yeah, nethack and angband really works my system hard ;-) 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 3) Most games require real-time like response.  Any program that requires
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such a reponse will benefit from problems fixed by working on a game.
</EM><BR>
The realtime you're talking about is not the same realtime referred
<BR>
to 'in the real world' with embedded systems.  If it were, QNX, OS-9
<BR>
or p-SOS would be the preferred gaming platforms of the day.  
<BR>
The only place you see the melding of realtime systems and
<BR>
something game-like is in simulators (the type you're strapped into) 
<BR>
at an amusement park where the coordination between gear movement 
<BR>
and visual display has to be good enough to fool your visual cortex.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; As for the demo, I think that Alpha has the potential to wow the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crowd.  A nice quick, graphical program (such as a game) would make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it really obvious that it is a fast little box. ;-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Many moons ago last year, I tried to get some guys at Compaq 
<BR>
interested in a demo for LW2k using a capture board, cheap ccd camera, 
<BR>
and a simple OpenGL demo.  Take the streaming video from the camera, 
<BR>
map it as a texture to geometric shapes, and morph it around.
<BR>
Drivers exist for the brooktree cards, and code exists for 
<BR>
mapping video input to everything from nurbs to other video 
<BR>
streams.  SGI was able to accomplish these types of tricks
<BR>
with hardware mpeg/jpeg handling; a real test of the Alpha's
<BR>
power would be to do all this on the main processor(s).  
<BR>
