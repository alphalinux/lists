<EM>&gt; Recently I checked the latest snapshot of XFree86 (3.9.17) and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was disappointed. There was no new driver support found. It is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already not easy to purchase VGA card suppored by Alpha/Linux 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because the supported models are old (and PCI). I must say that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux/Alpha is already and will be poor system as graphic machine 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compared with Linux/i386. 
</EM><BR>
<P>AGP is an issue that is being worked, both by API (UP1000 is now available
<BR>
and has an AGP slot) and COMPAQ (nothing yet, but 4X/Pro when available, IIRC).
<BR>
<P>Aside from that, I think the other thing that is reflected in the limited
<BR>
default build for Alpha is the fact that there are few folks who seem to be
<BR>
willing and able to take on the kind of development and testing needed to
<BR>
port the new (or existing) drivers to Alpha.
<BR>
<P>YOU could make a difference! Don't wait for other folks to do it, get access
<BR>
to a UP1000 and the cards you wish to see supported, and go at it! The XFree86
<BR>
folks will be grateful, the axp-list folks will be grateful, you'll be a hero.
