<P>
<EM>&gt; AGP is an issue that is being worked, both by API (UP1000 is now available
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and has an AGP slot) and COMPAQ (nothing yet, but 4X/Pro when available, IIRC).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Aside from that, I think the other thing that is reflected in the limited
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; default build for Alpha is the fact that there are few folks who seem to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; willing and able to take on the kind of development and testing needed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; port the new (or existing) drivers to Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; YOU could make a difference! Don't wait for other folks to do it, get access
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to a UP1000 and the cards you wish to see supported, and go at it! The XFree86
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; folks will be grateful, the axp-list folks will be grateful, you'll be a hero.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
be all that you can be :-)
<BR>
<P>About graphics support though, will Compaq make the Powerstorm series available on
<BR>
linux(as Intergraph stated that the Wildcat drivers will be ported to linux)?
<BR>
<P>Later
