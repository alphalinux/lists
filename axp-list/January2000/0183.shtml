<P>
<EM>&gt; I agree. After reading this book it suddenly became quite clear what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the differences are between Windows/Mac and *NIX. After I installed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RedHat 6.0 on my Cabriolet and Intel boxes I thought to myself.....'I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think we are loosing site of the tenets'. (I did opt for some major
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bells and whistles too.)
</EM><BR>
<P>I know what you mean.  I see that as well but bloatware is going to
<BR>
happen since Linux has hit the main stream.  However, given the way
<BR>
UNIX is designed, you can strip out the parts you don't want so it's OK.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I can see where development of games, browsers, and other 'goodies'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will benefit the overall in the future. Don't rule them out, keep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them as a choice.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As long as those interested in slim efficient boxes have a choice I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't have an issue. When it becomes necessary to use KDE or other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; large GUI's I probably will take issue. When I have to add 25% more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RAM to run the OS I'll probably take issue.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree completely.  Once the GUI cannot be separated from the OS, I'll be
<BR>
looking for another OS myself.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If we are not careful we'll find ourselves duplicating what MS has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; done.  A very large inefficient OS.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think that it will not happen simply because of the discussion we and
<BR>
others have about this very issue.  I think &quot;The UNIX Philosophy&quot; is
<BR>
correct and should be adhered to.  I believe the core Linux designers
<BR>
believe it too.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; $0.02 from a hobbyist -with flamesuit on- point of view
</EM><BR>
<P>HA!  No flamethrower here!  See ya!
