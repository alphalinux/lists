<EM>&gt; but the boot process freezes shortly after recognizing

<EM>&gt; the Promise card.  The disk is a 40G  Maxtor.

<P>I don't have the Promise card but I have put a 40GB drive
<BR>
on both DS10's and UP2000's on-board E-IDE connections.
<BR>
Things seem a bit touchy at the moment. The DS10 doesn't
<BR>
like seeing a cdrom and the 40GB Maxtor on the same channel.
<BR>
Gives errors with the patch you mention above on 2.2.14
<BR>
using DMA. The UP2000 doesn't want to see anything above 32GB.
<BR>
I'm using an E-IDE CDROM there also so it could be tied to
<BR>
that device being attached too. Haven't done all permutations.
<BR>
<P>There appear to be issues with mixing device types/speeds.
<BR>
Haven't tried a 2.3.x kernel yet.
<BR>
<P>On Intel, if I put two 40GB Maxtors on a channel, it seems
<BR>
to behave fine but this depends on the motherboard. Some
<BR>
motherboards are unhappy even doing that. The Supermicro
<BR>
PIISCD with Intel 820 chipset does not like large drives
<BR>
particularly well. VIA Apollo Pro+ chipset boards are more
<BR>
tolerant(PC133 memory/133FSB). Tried two of those and they
<BR>
are both happy. Possibly it's a BIOS issue but then I thought
<BR>
Linux didn't use the BIOS except during boot so that leads
<BR>
back to a driver problem.
<BR>
<P>Great price and performance though for those drives. I see
<BR>
13-24MB/sec on Intel using DMA depending where you're at
<BR>
on the platters. I filled the whole drive with 20GB files
<BR>
to check them out.
