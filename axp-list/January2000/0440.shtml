<P>
What I think is happening here is that the scan order for the different
<BR>
chipsets is different in MILO / Kernel vs. the BIOS
<BR>
so if my understanding is correct, BIOS sees the root drive as the first
<BR>
one (the one on the internal controller), and sees the drive on the
<BR>
external controller as the 2nd one.
<BR>
<P>when you go to MILO / Kernel, the order is reversed correct (ie the
<BR>
internal drive is now the 2nd drive and the external drive is now the 1st
<BR>
drive)
<BR>
<P>if this is true try this:
<BR>
(example is for milo)
<BR>
<P><EM>MILO&gt;boot sdb1:/boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/sdb1
</EM><BR>
<P>(you'll need to change /etc/fstab to reflect the fact that your root drive
<BR>
is sdb now and the other drive is sda.... also goes for any other
<BR>
partitions)
<BR>
this will at least get you up and running, things won't match between BIOS
<BR>
and MILO/ Kernl, but hey it works right?
<BR>
<P>I don't think the 'pci=reverse' option for boot will work to change this.
<BR>
does anyone know if there's a scan order option for the SCSI drivers (to
<BR>
reverse the order)?

<EM>&gt;I have to admit that I fail to understand this &quot;therefore&quot; above.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Device names and numbering used by firmware, or milo, have only weak
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;relationship with what can be used by kernel.	In all Alphas which I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have seen so far the system boots from this device from which it was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;told to boot and kernel does not have to be even located on a partition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which will serve as a root file system.  As long as you can read it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;i.e. at least one device which can hold it and is recognized by a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;firmware, this will do - be that some hard drive, floppy or CD.  If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are spooked by the fact that devices are relabelled in a boot process
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;then mount your file systems by LABEL or UUID.  This works for a looong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;time even if it is rarely used ('man mount' and 'man fstab' for more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;information).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I have a system here which boots - totally different configuration in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;each case - from all three hard drives attached.  Normally it totally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ignores all partitions on /dev/sda, when I not booted from that disk,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unless I mount them &quot;manually&quot;.  The reason for that is that I happened
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to configure it that way.  In the past I had a disk from which one could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;boot RH 6.0 from one partition and SuSE 6.1 from another one.	So what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is the problem here?
