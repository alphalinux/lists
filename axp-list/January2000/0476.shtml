My apologies for putting words in your mouth, Michal.  I agree that
<BR>
they are doing a great job of hiding the tools that we're used to
<BR>
behind an install UI that is supposed to be less intimidating to
<BR>
the new user.  I doubt it will ever get to the point where you
<BR>
stuff in a cd and type &quot;setup&quot; :-)  Come to think of it, didn't the
<BR>
original Slackware installs do something like that? (then you fed it
<BR>
floppies til your fingers fell off....)
<BR>
<P>To make a long story short, the install week from hell is over.  The
<BR>
box is built and behaving nicely.  Life is good.

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Like Michal said, a newbie wouldn't stand a snowball's chance in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hell getting an axp up with the current distros.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I did not say that.  Actually I can imagine a hardware/firmware
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; configuration on which &quot;point-and-click-aren't these pictures
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nice&quot; installation would work.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I wouldn't say all the current distro are screwed. I've done several
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; installs of Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 (slink) from scratch, each one worked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on the first try.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Various things will work, in different places, &quot;on the first try&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I did some succesful installations of RH 6.1 and even tried to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;play dumb&quot; - although with the later I was less lucky.  At least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it does not crash on a broken 'librpm' which is a progress. :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The more disturbing is a general trend in Linux installation utilities
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for better and better hiding tools which you may need when things will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stray from a prescribed scenario.  They are still there but if you do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not know where to look then you may find out yourself facing greyed out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; both &quot;Next&quot; and &quot;Previous&quot; arrows and now what?  This is not a property
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of a particular platform or distribution.  Yesterday &quot;Linux Today&quot; had a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; link to a review in which its author was smitten by an installation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; utility from Mandrake 7.0.  A comment from a reader pointed out that on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his machine an attempt to use this installer become a minor nightmare, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; big headache and a huge screwup. YYMV.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am getting also more and more careful about possible loss of data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (&quot;express install&quot; anyone? :-).   I was playing with &quot;Update
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installation&quot; a little bit and it &quot;updated&quot; ___with the same versions___
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some 180 MB of perfectly installed packages modifying various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; configuration files in the process. That after I walked manually a list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of packages to update and verifying that none is chosen. Sigh!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Although I didn't try booting from the CD, just made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the 3 floppy disks and used the CD as the source... 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It did boot where I tried.  With SRM firmware you can get away
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with no floppies at all.  This may lull you in a false sense of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; security, but this is another story. :-)
