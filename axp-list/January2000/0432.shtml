Hi folks, my apologies in advance for the following spew, and if I'm
<BR>
missing something obvious please let me know, but I've been chasing
<BR>
this for a week and...
<BR>
<P>&lt;rant&gt;
<BR>
I've had similar experiences w/ both RH 6.1 &amp; SuSE 6.3.  Both of these
<BR>
seem to lock you out of using linux fdisk and ptn the disk as they
<BR>
see fit.  There's no *need* to create 5 secondary ptns, but these
<BR>
guys seem to insist on taking that decision away from the admin
<BR>
who's creating the box.  They also don't appear to modify their build
<BR>
scripts very well (from the intel) to accommodate the differences in
<BR>
bootloader installation.  This is not a problem if you have control
<BR>
over how the disk is cut up, and wasn't a problem in RH5.x (dunno about
<BR>
SuSE), but it's a pretty thorough frustration with the current
<BR>
releases.  I'd like to do something simple like:
<BR>
<P>sda1 = 8M msdos (linload, milo, kernel if necessary, etc)
<BR>
sda2 = 2048M ext2 /
<BR>
sda3 = 160M swap
<BR>
sda4 = 2000M ext2 /opt or /home (symlinkable to whatever)
<BR>
<P>Additionally, the SuSE-6.3 default kernel doesn't support the 53c810
<BR>
scsi host.  Having milo load /etc/vm_full.gz from the cd gets past that,
<BR>
but it's one more thing that isn't documented well.  I suppose I could load
<BR>
up an earlier RH and ptn the disk then do the install, but that really
<BR>
shouldn't be necessary.
<BR>
&lt;/rant&gt;

<EM>&gt; Hi,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am trying to install RedHat 6.0 on a Alphastation 200.  I can get it to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; install with out a lot of problems.  Then when I go to boot into linux I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; run into problems.  I am booting from the arc console into milo.  After 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this I use the command
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; milo&gt; boot sda5:/vmlinux.gz
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this starts to boot and then eventually says that it is &quot;unable to open 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; initial console&quot;  What am I doing wrong?  Or is this common.
