Recently experienced a similar problem with one of our alpha linux systems
<BR>
after adding an Adaptec AHA 2940U2W to a 164LX.  All devices showed up
<BR>
during the initial boot, including the external ibm drive that was added. 
<BR>
But the system did not recognized the boot disk.  We had to swap the SCSI
<BR>
card slots so that the system would first see the Adaptec AHA 2940UW card
<BR>
which controlled the internal drives.  Prior to this swap, the drives were
<BR>
identified during boot as disk 1 or disk 2 by the order they were seen
<BR>
during the boot process.  Since the new card was appearing first, disk 1
<BR>
was being identified as the new ibm external disk.  It was identified as
<BR>
/dev/sda intstead of what used to be our boot disk.  Upon rearranging the
<BR>
card slots, the system booted off the proper drive. 
<BR>
<P>Another problem we had after adding the card.  We could not run the new
<BR>
card and drive with the &quot;two&quot; internal drives on the original card.  Using
<BR>
fdisk somehow corrupted the partition setup on the boot drive.  We
<BR>
currently operate with one drive on each card.  We have had no problem
<BR>
with either drive or card since, but would like to get the second internal
<BR>
drive back in the loop.  I would be curious to know whether anyone else
<BR>
has experienced this problem.  Is there a solution?
