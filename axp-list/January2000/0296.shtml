<P>
<EM>&gt; Please don't inadvertently force me to make it a new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personal project. 
</EM><BR>
Now that's a classic statement.  Quick, someone save it before bitrot
<BR>
sets in ;-) 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So please someone, Compaq, ANYONE, tell us the deal!
</EM><BR>
<P>See below.  Someone sent it to the ALO administrative mailing
<BR>
list last year. 
<BR>
<P>Let me preface this with two points; first and foremost, apologies
<BR>
to Leslie for not obtaining permission to re-post this ahead of time.
<BR>
I suspect the information will do more benefit than harm.  Second, 
<BR>
my personal interest in em86 is fairly low - the software I work
<BR>
with comes with source, which I port and fix if not 'Alpha-clean'.  
<BR>
Please don't send me em86 bug reports and stuff like that... 
<BR>
like Mark, my plate is full enough. 
<BR>

Subject: EM86 Status
To: [recipient list removed]
<P>Hello,
<P>I just I would drop everyone a note to let you know where em86 is
currently at.
<P>The linker problem has been solved 2 ways. First I have a quick patch
to ld.so that removes an assertion but  Ruediger Oertel pointed out
the real problem was a symbol in the emulator library.
<P>Second: I have traced the last segfault in the program to the
interaction of the emulator library and the glibc 2.1 stdio functions. My
guess is a recompile of the emulator library will fix this and I am hoping
real soon now to get the NDA for that.
<P>Third: With a patch to em86 and to ld.so I can get em86 to run under
glibc 2.1 any application that does not use stdio. The only application
so far that fits this bill is ldconfig86. sigh.
Fourth: As soon as I sleep (been up way too long on a really cool
porting project for the alpha) I am goin to post the latest sources to
my web site and upload them later to ftp.alphalinux.org (when their site
is working again) The only real change is some additional comments and it
can correctly detect which version of glibc is installed and it looks
for /usr/lib/libcpml.a to link against.
<P>As soon as I get the sources to the emulator I will tell everyone and
squash the last couple of bugs.
<P><P>My future plans involve trying to relink em86 with the shareware booch
emulator so that works. (This is a lot of work as the CPU interface has
totally changed)
<P>Sorry about it being so long between updates but there has been no real
news.
