<P>
The way to sell business on a platform (any platform) is by having:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High profile placements (&quot;eBay adopts Alpha over Sun 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enterprise 10000 servers&quot;)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having all major DB, middleware, and web software ported to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your platform (BEA Tuxedo, Oracle 8i, Cold Fusion, Dream
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weaver, etc.)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best (or atleast very competitive) TPC price per transaction
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(performance benchmark) - in other words, competitive pricing.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An available workforce trained in the equipment (Active support
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of education market, this is how Unix broke into the corporate
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;market, recent college graduates championed it at their new
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employers after graduation).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a manufacturer with a solid reputation to stand behind
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your decision.
<BR>
<P>With these elements in place, an IS Director can propose an
<BR>
Alpha solution knowing: he is not the first to do so, he will not
<BR>
be locked into one set of tools, the cost will be in-line  with
<BR>
the other suppliers, and if he has a problem, it will get fixed.
<BR>
Those are business concerns, not technical abilities. SGI
<BR>
made sure to showcase their systems graphical abilities
<BR>
because it was a differentiator, that was what made their
<BR>
systems stand out. Their successes were in graphics
<BR>
machines, not backend servers, IIRC.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SGI's prize for focusing on graphics/desktop front-end
<BR>
machines was a need to enter the WinNT market and
<BR>
compete with PC-class hardware.
<BR>

Subject: Re: Dream of the Alpha/Linux future 
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Probably no one would buy a system for serious use by just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;looking at games. But looking over the &quot;fence&quot; towards SGI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;helps. On every computer show, they ususally show off some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fancy, colourful moving/flipping/rotating graphics demo.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In effect, that gave them the reputation of being *the* graphics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;company.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now, Imagine, one would use a recent x86-world 3D games 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;accelerator on an alpha. Make people aware, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the grahpics used on the machine is some top-dog PC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;graphics ( like Nvidia's GeForce256 with DDR Ram ).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now port Quake to it. Use a GL, that makes use of all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;funny 264 features: fully pipelined FP, NVI instructions etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Put that system right *next* to a top-end x86 System using the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*same peripherals* ( important - same graphics ). Run the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;timedemo on both and see the Alpha fly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now what ? I admit, that this demo will probably not sell a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*single* system to a coorperate customer, but it will generate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the perception of alpha being a superior platform among the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;game-kidies. magazines will love to see a system like that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;being some sort of  top-end-games-reference machine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Give it as a free loaner for testing to the &quot;pc-mega-games&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;magazine ( or whatever they are called ).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You catch a trend here - the *only* reason, the average user
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is buying a faster x86 machine is for games. No one with some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;brains would claim, that you need a 30+ SPECint95 800Mhz
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Athlon to run Word or Excel.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;True, marketing is a *weird* thing. Wrong, I'm not into it ;-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But it sure makes sense demoing such a beast on trade shows.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Besides, I am not into games at all - I am far too slow to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;handle Quake and friends - just do not have the reflexes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I still stick to nethack and C when it comes to recreation :-)
