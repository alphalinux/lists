<P>
<EM>&gt; I have a non-practical question for everyone. 
</EM><BR>
The same question we (ALO) were asked by API last year.  
<BR>
Funny how everything comes around in time ;-) 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	What is your dream of the Alpha/Linux future? 
</EM><BR>
Clusters for scientific computing and rendering farms, 
<BR>
dedicated systems for networking, telecomm (telephony 
<BR>
&nbsp;under Linux is really taking off!) and signal processing, 
<BR>
general-purpose scientific workstations...
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; One thing I would love to see is a rocking Alpha/Linux game/demo page. 
</EM><BR>
Not me.  Besides the hack value, what would it accomplish? 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; We have source to games (Quake, descent, doom, heretic).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We have source to the Voodoo chipset drivers. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would love to have a knock-your-socks off graphic demo that I could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use to show off the alpha.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've been using Un*x for a decade, Linux for 7 years, and have a keen 
<BR>
dislike for most graphics.. so what I'm about to say might be biased.   
<BR>
<P>When I decided to go with Alphas, the first thing that came to mind 
<BR>
was not &quot;Gee, I hope this thing runs [game] fast&quot;.  The majority of 
<BR>
organizations and individuals using Linux on Alpha for real work
<BR>
probably only care about the performance of one or two applications
<BR>
critical for day-to-day operations.  Focusing energy on improving
<BR>
game performance under Linux/axp tells me you'd like to sucker in
<BR>
people whose use for a computer could be better served by a game
<BR>
console.  Don't get me wrong.. I think it's a nice afterthought 
<BR>
to have some slick games under Linux, but the having the 
<BR>
first impression of &quot;Wow, it runs Quake.&quot; is probably not constructive.
<BR>
<P><P>If Compaq or API plan to introduce a low-end Alpha box with fast 
<BR>
graphics and a &lt; $1500USD price tag targeted at home users and use
<BR>
suped-up video games to market it, more power to them.  I just feel
<BR>
that showing off video games on a $5k+ system is a bit silly ;-)
