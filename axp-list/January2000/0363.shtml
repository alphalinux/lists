<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Would API consider releasing a flash-writer to flash MILO in?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Just what is a 'flash-writer'? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>ehmm.. flash ROM {programming, management} utility. Sort of like the
<BR>
miniport.exe supplied with the board, but for the whole firmware.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Again, the problem might not be with API,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but rather DeskStation. They designed the board and still 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'own' it, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they don't like to talk about it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>which is a shame.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Agreed, and this would be good seeing as ARCSBios is dead.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>and UX is eol. However UX will be around for a good while to come. And a lot
<BR>
of people might buy them 2nd/3rd/.. handy to learn linux/alpha on.
<BR>
<P>So now is the time to get programming info. There's a paragraph in the UX
<BR>
technical reference manual about the flash ROM. Basically saying that it's
<BR>
mapped in 2 segments.
<BR>
<P>segment 1 is RO after boot (presumably the fail safe firmware). Segment 2
<BR>
(presumably main firmware) is mapped somewhere else and is RW, but must only
<BR>
be accessed with byte wise load and store instructions.
<BR>
<P>But that's not really a lot of info. eg What explicitely is in segment 1/2,
<BR>
and if we put something in segment 2 how will the first stage firmware
<BR>
jumpstart it? etc...
<BR>
<P>-paul.
