I have a PCI soundcard with the Ensoniq 1370 chip on it, and it works
<BR>
flawlessly on my SX164 running RH6.1.  We just purchased some more of these
<BR>
cards for a lab here at school, and paid less than $16 (USD) each for them.
<BR>
A quick check on pricewatch shows Comp-U-Plus has them for $13.
<BR>
As for network cards, I usually try to find tulip (DECchip 21x4x) based
<BR>
cards, however that has been becoming more and more difficult lately.

<EM>&gt; Subject: 	pci ethernet vs. pci sound
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Okay. I have a pc164 linux box here, with an isa ne2000 card, a sb16
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isa card, and a few other pci cards. In other words, all of my isa slots
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are taken up. I have only one slot left, a pci. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   The problem is this. I want to set up masquerading on this box so when I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; go adsl in a week, the machines on my lan can get out. That means that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need to have two ethernet cards in here, but I've only got the one is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ne2000. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   So. I'm at an empasse. Do I chunk a soundblaster 16 card that works
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; flawlessly in this box for a cheap pci sound card and install an old isa
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SMC ethernet card in the slot that I free up, or do I go out and buy a pci
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ethernet card?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   I would prefer to conform to the analogy &quot;if it ain't broke, don't fix
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it.&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   My question : what good, _cheap_ (cheap = under $50) pci ethernet cards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are out there that will work on alphas? I don't need a swiss army card.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is just a cheesy home lan that has an ancient mac, this box, and an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ancient r6k on it. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Failing that, there are loads of super super cheap sound cards out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there. This sb16 is about 5 years old. What chipsets on pci sound cards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
