Hello,
<BR>
I'm really new to Alpha/Linux. We're trying to install an Adaptec 2940 to an XP1000. In the startup, the card is detected. We connected an external SCSI tape drive and it booted fine. We then disconnected the tape drive and connected an external SCSI Seagate hard disk. During the boot process, the card and external hard drive, as well as the internal hard drive were all recognized. However an error came up - HALT CODE = 5 , boot failure, etc... I then disabled the BIOS on the SCSI card and got the same results. How can I get this setup to work? I also cannot get the SCSISelect to come up on the Alpha. I'm not sure how to install the patch found on the Compaq website - the file is an .exe. With my little experience with Alpha/Linux , step by step instructions will be most helpful. Hope you can help! Thanks!
<BR>
<P>Also, are there are other SCSI cards that will work smoother?
<BR>
