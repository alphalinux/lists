<P>
<EM>&gt; Isn't there another Transmeta employee who has/had some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exp. with Compaq/DEC loaner equipment? Maybe VA Linux
</EM><BR>
Uh, you mean Linus? He's not exactly enthusiastic about the
<BR>
Alpha since Intel stuck a quad x86 with insane specs in his lap. 
<BR>
Same goes for Alan Cox.  He told me about a year ago that
<BR>
he would have no use for an Alpha - no need to learn a 
<BR>
new architecture is what he said.  Redhat sent him an 
<BR>
Alpha and, true to his earlier credo, it now collects 
<BR>
dust.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; can help out, Maddog should be able to squeak a few Alphas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out of his new employers warehouse *if* a suitable case can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be made...
</EM><BR>
<P>I contacted both Theodore and Peter to say we (ALO) would try to 
<BR>
accomidate them.  Have it on good authority that someone at
<BR>
API contacted them later that evening.  
<BR>
<P>Those two could turn out to be very valuable when it comes to 
<BR>
ensuring 2.3/2.4 work with Alphas; certainly Jay and Rich Henderson
<BR>
can use help in that area.  I've been busy coding stuff for the 
<BR>
2.2 kernel, and have a big project up my sleeves right now 
<BR>
involving AlphaLinux.  But that topic is neither here nor 
<BR>
there.... ;-)
