Hi,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; [... stuff deleted ...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; A more reasonable estimate hovers closer to 4 when discussing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 2.2.x.  In my opinion, one or more of these hot-to-trot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; big iron houses (IBM, SGI, Sun) needs to put more actions to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their words and contribute some useful code in the way of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; scalability.  Chances are good none of them will, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; highly-scalable systems running commercial Un*x implementations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are their honeypot du jour.
</EM><BR>
<P>Th point is, that in almost every case, &quot;scalability&quot; is not achieved by 
<BR>
&quot;adding some code/function&quot; to the kernel. Most of the time, it's about
<BR>
carefully using locks in important kernel structures to allow kernel
<BR>
functions accessing them concurrently. In Linux, these datastructures
<BR>
are implemented quite differently compared to other unices. Although
<BR>
most unices behave similar from a userland perspective, the grunt
<BR>
stuff in the kernel is often quite different. Doing things in the kernel
<BR>
that scale well on lets say above 8 CPU's is hard. Providing
<BR>
the very same functionality scaling on 16, 32 or even 64 CPU's is
<BR>
a whole *different* story. I wish - for example - Sun would release
<BR>
the SunOS 5 ( aka Solaris ) kernel sources they use on an E10000
<BR>
( 64 CPU UltraSPARC - big iron in it's very sense ). By just *looking*
<BR>
at the code, it would reveal *dramatic* differences to what used to 
<BR>
be *standard Unix kernel algorithms* a la Maurice Bach ( &quot;The design
<BR>
of the Unix operating system&quot; - a must-read ).
<BR>
Although I am convinced,. Linux will evolve to a point were it will
<BR>
scale on more CPU's than today, I am also convinced, it will look
<BR>
quite differently in the internals.
<BR>
Please keep in mind, that it took a long time for *all* of the big-iron
<BR>
companies to get their Unix scaling on large SMP machines. They
<BR>
used big engineering teams of very competent programmers to get
<BR>
what they have today.
<BR>
<P>Linux *will* get to this point - but it will take time. Personally, I am
<BR>
very happy about all the valuable pieces of code coming from
<BR>
various sources moving Linux in that direction.
<BR>
<P>&lt;humor&gt;
<BR>
To quote Jay Estabrook, a couple of postings ago:
<BR>
&quot;YOU could make a difference! Don't wait for other folks to do it..... &quot;
<BR>
8-)
<BR>
&lt;/humor&gt;
<BR>
<P>Have fun !
<BR>
