Hi.


Recently I checked the latest snapshot of XFree86 (3.9.17) and

was disappointed. There was no new driver support found. It is

already not easy to purchase VGA card suppored by Alpha/Linux

because the supported models are old (and PCI). I must say that

Linux/Alpha is already and will be poor system as graphic machine

compared with Linux/i386.
