<P>
<EM>&gt; Personally, I'd like to see a greater variety of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; processors in the market.. sharing the market. That is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to say, no single architecture has an overwhelming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dominance. (like Intel has today) And I'd like to see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha with a fair share of the market. I'd like to see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all these different architectures compete against each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other and accelerate their technological advances and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; push their prices down.
</EM><BR>
<P>This was and still is a possibility.  It all depends on the marketing of
<BR>
the product.  It's not the technical excellence of the product.  Case in
<BR>
point:
<BR>
<P>SGI Mips and DEC/Compaq Alpha
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-vs-
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intel Pentium
<BR>
<P>Old and new DEC/Compaq and SGI hardware are excellent but they were not
<BR>
marketed well.  They niched themselves instead of going for a wider 
<BR>
appeal.  Intel, with IBM's and Micro$loft's help, became the &quot;chip for
<BR>
the corporate world&quot;.  This gave Intel processors mass appeal and thus
<BR>
giving Intel a boatload of influence in the market.  You know you're
<BR>
successful when companies clone your product: AMD and Cyrix.
<BR>
<P>I'm not even going to get into the management and marketing fiasco that
<BR>
has and continues to happen at Apple.
<BR>
<P>Then again . . .
<BR>
<P>Apple just doesn't seem to get it.  Tangerine and Blueberry iMacs?  Good
<BR>
God!  They continualy shoot themselves in the foot.  The Mac concept and
<BR>
the MacOS beats the crap out of Win/Intel technology but they corporate/
<BR>
executive level misunderstands just continually drive Apple into the
<BR>
ground.  They need to start thinking of the wider/corporate appeal.  Stop
<BR>
with the cute cases and spiffy colors.  Greys and tans are just fine.
<BR>
Personally, the color of the case is not going to sway me one way or
<BR>
another.  They things that will sway are:
<BR>
<P>1. The technical excellence in the architectural design,
<BR>
2. The quality of materials and construction,
<BR>
3. The hardware support by the OEM and third party resellers,
<BR>
4. The quality and support for the third party software developed for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the architecture.
<BR>
5. Long term survivability of the EOM.  (This means their marketing)
<BR>
<P>Apple does do well on 1 - 3.  However, 4 is in questions and 5 is a joke.
<BR>
Does anyone know what company pumped 200 million dollars into Apple
<BR>
recently?  Answer: MicroSloth!  No prizes for figuring out why!  :-)
<BR>
<P>Then again, perhaps I'm the Mr. Ford of my time: &quot;You can have any color
<BR>
you want as long as it's black&quot;.  :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And in the chaos of all these architectures being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; used, people start dumping OSes that can only run on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; limited number of architectures. Linux and BSD become
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the OSes of choice for being able to run on so many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; architectures. In light of this, corporations decide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to pool their technologies to help advance Linux and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BSD to its fullest potential. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Micro$loth does understand this and will adjust to run on multiple
<BR>
platforms (read: any and all) as soon as any of the following are
<BR>
true:
<BR>
<P>1. Doing so is critical to the long term survival of MicroSloth or
<BR>
2. It's politically expedient or
<BR>
3. It's profitable.
<BR>
<P>Micro$loth is profit (read: market) driven.  To them, it's not's whose
<BR>
best but who seems and is preceived to offer the best, long term
<BR>
solutions.  Welcome to show biz.  Politics, sales, and marketing are all
<BR>
show biz.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Then, Unix in general develops more user friendly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interfaces, so that people have a choice to use an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; easy to use GUI that will shield them from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; internals and command line. Oh, and since only Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and BSD survive, the word &quot;Unix&quot; becomes public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; domain.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hummm . . . maybe but we will have to overcome the high level of inertia
<BR>
of X11.  I'm not sure that X11 can do what is required to bring a GUI
<BR>
Desktop that the novice can use.  Remember the UNIX tenets stated in &quot;The
<BR>
UNIX Philosophy&quot;.  UNIX is not easy to use because it can do so many
<BR>
things and is very efficient.  They technical level of UNIX users is
<BR>
higher, by and large, than their Windows/MacOS counterparts.  Get the book
<BR>
and read it.  I think there is a new edition of the book out that has soom
<BR>
updates expounding upon more current events.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As all this is happening, the OS becomes a shielding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; layer from the hardware... and people no longer choose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hardware architecture because of available software,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but only for raw performance. They all realise Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kicks ass... and eventually dump everything else for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Alpha. Of course, by this time, I've bought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; countless number of shares of Compaq...;-)
</EM><BR>
<P>This IS where things are heading.  Hardware appliances are the fad of the
<BR>
future.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I wake up yelling &quot;Alpha ROCKS!!!&quot; and fall out of my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bed.... realising..... it's just a dream.
</EM><BR>
<P>HA HA HA!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; D.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Hi All,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 	Alot of the questions/answers on this list are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; problems/solutions to setup Alpha/Linux.  Very good,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Very practical.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I have a non-practical question for everyone. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 	What is your dream of the Alpha/Linux future? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; One thing I would love to see is a rocking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Alpha/Linux game/demo page. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; We have source to games (Quake, descent, doom,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; heretic).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; We have source to the Voodoo chipset drivers. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I would love to have a knock-your-socks off graphic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; demo that I could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; use to show off the alpha.
</EM><BR>
