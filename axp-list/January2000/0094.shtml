<P>That's a definite possibility. I'll try a new kernel. I did some more playing 
<BR>
with the fonts and actually have made some good progress. What I found is...
<BR>
<P>1) changing when the truetype fonts get loaded makes a BIG difference. By doing

this

<P># Multiple FontPath entries are allowed (they are concatenated together)

# By default, Red Hat 6.0 and later now use a font server independent of

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FontPath   &quot;unix/:-1&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FontPath    &quot;/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType&quot;
<BR>
<P>X will stay up and when it crashes it wont dump me back to SRM. 
<BR>
<P>2) wmaker doesn't seem to like ttf at all and crashes immediatly upon starting
<BR>
xfontsel or gfontsel.
<BR>
3) enlightenment on it's own runs well with ttf and DU netscape runs like a
<BR>
champ.
<BR>
4) gnome-session will crash (and restart in runlevel 5) after a few seconds of
<BR>
just being up.
<BR>
<P>Then for I start up E all by itself,  I middle click for the menu, it makes a
<BR>
sound (running esd) , and it crashes the whole system, dumps me to SRM,
<BR>
and gives me a PYXIS .... CHECK and what looks like a dump of all the registers.
<BR>
Me thinks it's sound ;-) .
<BR>
<P>Speaking of sound drivers has anyone tried ALSA
<BR>
support? Does it work any better than whats included in the kernel? 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; for the record:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have an ess1371 pci sound card and a symbios 53c875 scsi card. I first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; noticed the lockup when x11amp was playing an hdd access occured, but it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; locked up w/o X, too.
</EM><BR>
<P>I also should have mentioned before I'm running software RAID, specificly RAID
<BR>
0 on a few mount points like /usr and /var.  Thanks Jason.
