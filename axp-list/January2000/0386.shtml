<EM>&gt; &gt; While Symbios cards are less likely to have problems, they still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; do have them. Anyone who uses them on a 21264 should have went
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thru it recently with timeout issues and not being able to even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; boot. Check this list's archives for info.

<EM>&gt; If you really remember that discussion, you'll remember that it was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; NOT the drivers at fault, but the unhappy union of new compiler, naive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; macro code sequence, and the EV6 CPU. Same *exact* kernel/drivers on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; older CPUs would work just fine (IIRC).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But, like you, knowing the cause still doesn't compensate for the pain...

<P>Yes, it did work on older cpus. Problems are problems though.
<BR>
<P>The point is Symbios is not blessed with perfection as
<BR>
several posts imply. Every piece of HW has it's good 
<BR>
points and bad points. I don't recall any that worked 
<BR>
perfectly, at least not initially. 
<BR>
<P>And too, Intraserver is definitely NOT the cost effective 
<BR>
Symbios solution. Their pricing is not competitive with at 
<BR>
least 3 other equivalent boards as has been mentioned.
<BR>
They may have more of a warranty department though if that
<BR>
makes someone more comfortable. I'd rather have the extra
<BR>
card sitting in my parts drawer though that I bought because
<BR>
they were cheaper.
