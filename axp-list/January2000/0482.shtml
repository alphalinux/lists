<EM>&gt; &gt; floppies til your fingers fell off....)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, that would be later SLS releases.  I have 80 or so floppies from 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that era, none of which probably work.  Slackware was a welcome relief 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because - in theory at least - you could pick and choose between 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; package sets and not have to install unnecessary stuff.  That
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was an interesting trip down memory lane.. I'm almost inspired to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power up the old 386SX....
</EM><BR>
<P>I remember sitting in the computer lab one night copying down slackware
<BR>
onto floppies. Yes, it was better in that you only had to download the
<BR>
sets you wanted, but it still took quite a few floppies to build a usable
<BR>
system. I also remember that you had to setup swap manually before
<BR>
starting the install if you had 4Meg or less of memory (which I
<BR>
did)....No, I'll stick to SRM and a CD thanks :)
