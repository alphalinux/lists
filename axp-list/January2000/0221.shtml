<P>
<EM>&gt; You catch a trend here - the *only* reason, the average user
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is buying a faster x86 machine is for games. No one with some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brains would claim, that you need a 30+ SPECint95 800Mhz
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Athlon to run Word or Excel.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is true but I see the market changing.  the WinTel workstation is
<BR>
still, and probably will continue to be, the corporate desktop.  A WinTel
<BR>
server will probably be the back office (File and Print) server.  However,
<BR>
Intel is now pushing hard into the mid-tier server area, such as Internet
<BR>
and enterprise servers.  They *are* making a dent.  This is why companies
<BR>
like Compaq with it's Alpha, CGI with is Mips, and Sun with it's
<BR>
UltraSPARC better think hard and come up with a strategy that can keep the
<BR>
LinTel market from becoming a threat to their market share.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; True, marketing is a *weird* thing. Wrong, I'm not into it ;-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But it sure makes sense demoing such a beast on trade shows.
</EM><BR>
<P>Marketing is perception.  It's a message that tells you how to solve a
<BR>
problem.  You want to look younger, ladies?  Use Pond's Cold Cream.  You
<BR>
want to get rid of that dandruff, use Head and Shoulders.  Want firm abs,
<BR>
use the Nordatrack.  Want inexpensive servers with a long life, use
<BR>
LinTel.
<BR>
<P>How would you sell LinTel to a corporation?
<BR>
