<P>
Richard (and everyone else),
<BR>
<P>I have tried both of your suggestions but each has failed in the same way. I
<BR>
have since been advised that librpm was buggy in RH6.0 and my nfsroot install
<BR>
was triggering the bug tus causing the signal 11. The suggestion made was to
<BR>
move on to Redhat 6.1.
<BR>
<P>So I have - and to not particularly to my surprise I am now having troubles
<BR>
with the Redhat 6.1 installer. This time however I cannot even make it into
<BR>
the installer as during installer startup when 300k of RAM is allocated as
<BR>
ramdisk space the step fails and the installer so politely states that &quot;I
<BR>
cannot recover from this&quot;. This is also extremely weird as a similar step
<BR>
seems to execute flawlessly in the redhat 6.0 install.
<BR>
<P>If somebody could  please offer any suggestions as to why this problem is
<BR>
occuring I would be extremely greatful. I would also like to know how buggy
<BR>
installers like this get past integration or even unit testing at Redhat as I
<BR>
don't think that a nfsroot install is that exotic, in fact should't it be
<BR>
completely transperant to the installer anyhow.
<BR>
<P>In addition if anybody has managed to complete an nfsroot install (i.e.
<BR>
having the ramdisk.img mounted on another machine and use nfs to allow the
<BR>
machine to be installed on to use the nfs mounted image as its root
<BR>
directory) with RedHat 6.1 (or even RedHat 6.0) could you please offer any
<BR>
advice you deem important- that would be terrific also.
<BR>
<P>Thanks in advance,
<BR>
Dean.

<P><P><P><EM>&gt; Have you tried not doing the Custom setup? Choosing workstation or Server?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also if you can't setup BSD disklabes from disk druid, you'll need to use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fdisk. If you are going to continue using bootp to load the kernel that's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fine, but if you wish to boot a kernel from the HD you'll need the BSD
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disklabels.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; --rdp
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I am sure I am using the new installer as it was built on May 28th 1999,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; whilst the original image contained an installer built on April 19th
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 1999.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If somebody could shed some light upon this somewhat strange problem it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would be much appreciated.
