<EM>&gt; I've done some playing and I took some of mark's advice. I pulled the sound card
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out and stuck it in my windows box. Then I read the PnP howto and learned how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to &quot;force&quot; settings into the card. I did that and verified it by rebooting  a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; few times. I then took the sound card out and put it back in my Alpha, I had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also accidently left my /etc/isapnp.conf file in place when I &quot;should&quot; have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; taken it out. As I boot I notice isapnp fails, Once I login I try isapnp again
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and it complains about  an error before &quot; (ISOLATE PRESERVE)&quot;. Curious I comment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out the thing I just mentioned and nothing happens. OK, I then uncomment it and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comment out (READPORT 0x0203).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  It then works but when I look in /proc I see no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interrupts for th soundcard. I then reboot. as it boots I see sound (which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compiled into the kernel) initialize but there's a catch. whenever sound is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; used the whole system will stand still until that sound is finished
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; playing but at the same time no sound is heard. I did this a few times and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decided to reboot. This time the sound card is not detected and im back where I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; started. It doesn't make any sense. I then poped the card back in my windows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; box and verifed that yes the settings are still forced. Now how do I get the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; card to  be initialzed at boot ? Thanks.

<P>When I had trouble with my soundcard (a vanilla SB16) with my Alpha
<BR>
I'd just nuke /etc/isapnp.conf and redo the pnpdump, followed by
<BR>
a sndconfig.
<BR>
<P>Once the /etc/isapnp.conf is set I'm careful I don't mess with it
<BR>
directly.  I had trouble where I misconfigured the file and then my
<BR>
X session would freeze, forcing me to reboot.
<BR>
<P>&lt;OffTopic&gt;  On my PC164 running RH 6.1 I can't do a warm reboot.
<BR>
For some reason that always hoses my sound card.
