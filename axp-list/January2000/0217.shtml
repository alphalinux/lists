<P>
<EM>&gt; What I'd like to see is more compact packaging so I can get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; densities similar to the current Intel 1U cases. I'm not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interested in SMP boxes particularly but a 2/4 way in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same space as a DS10 would be of interest, assuming similar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; price points.(I'd pay 2x/4x what a DS10 costs for them)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Otherwise, 1U DS10's would work OK too.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hummm . . . I would prefer more modularity.  I would like to buy a
<BR>
chasis that supported mulitple, independent systems that could be
<BR>
accessed independently or, with the right OS, as a single machine.
<BR>
This is what I would consider to be the next &quot;cluster&quot; for Linux.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For my line of work, cheap, dense, compute clusters are the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way to go. I've got a UP2000 on order but I suspect the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slot B cartidge is a mistake. It looks huge. Assuming the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; board can be put into a 3U rack mount case, it has my 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attention though. Then I get 2 cpus for the same rack space 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as a DS10. That alone would half the foot print of a large 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; configuration. Still like DS10's too though.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.  I like the idea of &quot;Stack 'em, Rack 'em, and Pack 'em&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'd be surprised if Compaq felt the home market was their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; target. Why sell a $2000-$5000 cpu and $2000+ motherboards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if that were the target audience?  Even the UP1000, at around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; $700 for board and $2000 for the processor doesn't compare
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to current PC prices. It's around 2-4 times more expensive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Home users won't have much interest and that's who might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually care about whizbang game performance.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are correct.  Compaq's main target is corporate.  If you want the big
<BR>
bucks you aim for business to business deals, not business to consumer
<BR>
deals.  However, there are notable exceptions:
<BR>
<P>Wal-Mart
<BR>
The big three U.S. Auto makers
<BR>
Phillip Morris
<BR>
KLM
<BR>
etc . . .
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; As a poll, how many people on this list own a 21264 based box
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for your home use??
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't but I sure use them for production work.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not me.  I use a couple of old Multia's.
