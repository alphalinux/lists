I'd love to see some of those articles on ALO. Could you send them to me?

<EM>&gt; &gt; Ok I've been seeing a lot of articles lately covering Linux on PowerPC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; yet NONE on Alpha... I'm guessing this is due to that ugly paper weight
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; called the icrap err imac, excuse me. I'd like to see Alpha Linux make a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; better show out there, even if I have to write the damn articles myself!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Not that anyone want's to read what I have to say (I'll know by how many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people reply to this ;-). What do you all think? Anyone interested in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; writing an article about ANYTHING related to Linux on Alpha? Maybe we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; can get Rich to put something up on the AlphaLinux.org site? Anything?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Anyone? Or have I gone off the DEEP end?!? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, I obviously can speak only for myself :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I write articles for a german Unix magazine ( called UnixOpen ) on a regular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; basis. Although this is not my main job, it rapidly consumes more and more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of my time. I have already in the past done *several* articles on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha arch in general, as well as running Linux on Alphas - you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guessed right: Alpha *is* my personal favorite arch and Linux is among
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my favorite OSes. Currently, I am doing a rather big article series
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the UP2000 covering EV6, the Tsunami chipset, Linux &amp; NetBSD and a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; performance comparison with an Athlon based machine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I cannot really comment on the situation in the US, but I assume it is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really that much different compared to Germany. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The mainstream Linux is definitely with x86, so most of the overall press
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; coverage goes into this. In addition, most articles cover things like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installation and comparing various distributions. Personally, I've never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seen too much sense in this approach, mainly for the following reasons:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1. People do not install Linux every day, they rather tend to run it, once
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     it is installed :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2. Honestly, most distributions are alike. They run the same kernels, most 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     of the apps are the same and I would regard the differences between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     rpm, dpkg and the like to be of minor importance in a production
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     environment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I found the main reason for the lack of coverage on alternative archs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be the lack of competent Editors. You'll find a *lot* of people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; writing articles about how great their Linux runs on a 500Mhz Pentium-II,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is overclocked to 501Mhz - yes, I too think that sucks. But you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are in *serious* trouble, if you want to find someone covering things like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the difference between ARC and SRM. Back in 1997, I wrote an article
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the PC164, which was fairly new at that time. Among a lot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of other things, it contained infos about which PCI cards run on that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; board and how easy it was to set up a decent system using that board
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with standard PC-type peripherals and how easy it was to get Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on this machine. I was stunned by the amount of reader-feedback we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; got for this article. People were amazed to learn, that running an Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is really not bizarre black-magic. The very same was repeated for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the SPARC arch - with the same result. Based on the boatload of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; x86-based systems being shoved through my home-office for testing,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I know almost as well as anybody else on the mailing-list, how much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more advanced about *any* other architecture is ( I confess - I did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; PC mainboard devel for a big taiwanese company in one of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my previous lives... ). Although the x86 chips got *a lot* better in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; past three or four years, the chipsets and mainboards are still crap
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ( or are you telling me, that there is a *technical* advantage in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; having a 64bit memory-bus in a system running two Pentium-III 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at 800Mhz ).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Based on my experience in that past years, finding a competent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; techwriter is the main problem for about anything that is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; x86 or MS. It is definitely *not* the lack of interest in the reader
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; base of any decent computer mag.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I *strongly* suggest, that anybody being interested in writing stuff
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for things like Linux-Alpha should approach a magazine with that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idea. As stated above, I can only speak for Germany, but I cannot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe, that it is that much different in the US.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As a popular commercial stated: Just do it.
