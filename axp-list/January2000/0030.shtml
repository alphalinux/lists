Hi,
<BR>
<P>Ben Myers (benmyers@ma.ultranet.com) in the US has lots of info/knowledge
<BR>
about the XL pc variants, sells stuff , and is close to a distribution center
<BR>
so he gets good deals on stuff. He monitors the comp.sys.dec newsgroup among
<BR>
others. Try him.
<BR>
<P>(Sorry, don't know of a European source. I'm in Canada.)
<BR>
<P>Evan
<BR>
<P>P.S. The following is a response from Ben to the newsgroup on a similar
<BR>
subject...
<BR>
<P><P>Steve,
<BR>
<P>If the motherboard in question carries DEC part# 54-23606-01, you have
<BR>
a Celebris XL with an Alpha PowerGrade daughter card.  And you that is
<BR>
what you have, I have power supplies in stock that match the board.  I
<BR>
glommed onto some that Compaq had no room for in their warehouse, and
<BR>
no willingness to keep any longer.  (You may note also the various
<BR>
acts of hardware genocide Compaq is committing on the ex-DEC hardware:
<BR>
info disappearing from Compaq web site, broken links, hard to
<BR>
navigate.  Well, they are also getting rid of many of the spares,
<BR>
too.)  $US 40 + exact shipping.
<BR>
<P>If you do not have a case for all your kit, I have those, too.
<BR>
Probably the same price, but quite heavy.
<BR>
<P>Problem is I am on the other side of the pond.  If it is worth your
<BR>
while to pay the freight, I can ship power supply and/or case to
<BR>
you... Ben Myers

<P><EM>&gt;I have a DEC MB that uses a plug-in Alpha 233 daughterboard. I have no other

<P><EM>&gt;case or peripherals. I would like to purchase a newer Alpha system in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;future, but as usual this has to work as a trial first to release the

<EM>&gt;finance.

<P><EM>&gt;The board has two standard AT style connectors (J16) and a third
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;suplementary AT connector (J14).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Also, there is an ATX (but only 8 by 2 pin) connector (J18) that seems to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;supply 3.3v to the processor daughterboard and PCI bus.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Does any kind service engineer have the pin-outs/ins of these connectors, or
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;could run a multimeter over their own to give me the correct voltages
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;required at these pins.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I must say the Compaq Web sites seem to be decimated when it comes to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;information on older DEC products, it gives me little incentive to invest in
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Alpha for the future. All have the sort of info that is easy to find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;elsewhere such as serial port, SCSI and Parallel pinouts, but not one Web
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;document has any information of substance when it comes to service or fault
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;finding info. What does a Compaq field engineer do, just swap-out board
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;until it works I presume. It leads me to think that they want the product to
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;die.

<P><EM>&gt; Hi,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I recently got hold of an old  DECpc XL 466d2. This is not an Alpha (yet)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but a 486 dx2 machine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This machine has a CPU daughtercard which can be replaced. The upgrade
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; path for these machines include Alpha CPU's.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Does anyone know:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - if these Alpha upgrades were actually sold at any point in time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - were one could get a hold of one (cheap) , preferrably in Holland
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - if this is the same motherboard as used in the XL alpha machines ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - If I need to get a different &quot;bios&quot; when I replace the CPU board ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - were there ever dual pentium cpu-boards available ? (Keep in mind I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3 alpha's , but I have never owned a pentium (yet)   ;-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I could not find a lot of info on the digital websites , if anyone knows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where to get more info , that would help a lot too !
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TIA,
</EM><BR>
