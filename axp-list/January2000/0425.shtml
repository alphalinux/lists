I've done some playing and I took some of mark's advice. I pulled the sound card
<BR>
out and stuck it in my windows box. Then I read the PnP howto and learned how
<BR>
to &quot;force&quot; settings into the card. I did that and verified it by rebooting  a
<BR>
few times. I then took the sound card out and put it back in my Alpha, I had
<BR>
also accidently left my /etc/isapnp.conf file in place when I &quot;should&quot; have
<BR>
taken it out. As I boot I notice isapnp fails, Once I login I try isapnp again
<BR>
and it complains about  an error before &quot; (ISOLATE PRESERVE)&quot;. Curious I comment
<BR>
out the thing I just mentioned and nothing happens. OK, I then uncomment it and
<BR>
comment out (READPORT 0x0203).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;It then works but when I look in /proc I see no
<BR>
interrupts for th soundcard. I then reboot. as it boots I see sound (which is
<BR>
compiled into the kernel) initialize but there's a catch. whenever sound is
<BR>
used the whole system will stand still until that sound is finished
<BR>
playing but at the same time no sound is heard. I did this a few times and
<BR>
decided to reboot. This time the sound card is not detected and im back where I
<BR>
started. It doesn't make any sense. I then poped the card back in my windows
<BR>
box and verifed that yes the settings are still forced. Now how do I get the
<BR>
card to  be initialzed at boot ? Thanks.
<BR>
