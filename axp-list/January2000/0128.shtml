<P>&lt;preface&gt;I don't want to start any pissing contests here.&lt;/preface&gt;

<P>I don't know about everyone else, but I do know that we (Compaq)
<BR>
certainly qualify as a &quot;big iron house&quot; and there are quite a few people
<BR>
here that are working directly on overall performance and scalability.
<BR>
I've seen Alan Cox mention that IBM has released at least one
<BR>
scalability-related patch (probably more), and SGI is all over the place
<BR>
with performance and scalability efforts (don't have personal knowledge
<BR>
about Sun).
<BR>
<P>Problem is, we're probably hiding the fact that we're doing this XYZ
<BR>
performance work on behalf of ABC company, either by accident or not.
<BR>
While I'm not allowed to talk officially for Compaq (i.e. disclaimer ;)
<BR>
I can say that there is active work going on - that's why I bothered to
<BR>
port the lockmetering code from SGI over to Alpha.
<BR>
<P>So, what I'd say is: Is it happening?  Yes.  Is it happening fast
<BR>
enough?  Probably not. (MHO, of course).  And will it support Wildfire?
<BR>
Couldn't tell you anyway ;)
