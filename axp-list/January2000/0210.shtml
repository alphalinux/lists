<EM>&gt; &gt; Ask yourself how many businesses would buy N boxes based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on looking at a game? I certainly wouldn't. See how odd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that sounds??? A business selecting a box because it can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; waste an employee's time?? I know you say it means performance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in other areas are good too but that is exactly the point.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You sell based on the other areas to businesses, not games.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Probably no one would buy a system for serious use by just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looking at games. But looking over the &quot;fence&quot; towards SGI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; helps. On every computer show, they ususally show off some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fancy, colourful moving/flipping/rotating graphics demo.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In effect, that gave them the reputation of being *the* graphics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; company.
</EM><BR>
<P>Note here you said graphics demo, not a game. I have no
<BR>
problems with a graphics demo. I've used graphics myself to
<BR>
catch a passer-by's eye at shows.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now, Imagine, one would use a recent x86-world 3D games
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accelerator on an alpha. Make people aware, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the grahpics used on the machine is some top-dog PC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; graphics ( like Nvidia's GeForce256 with DDR Ram ).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now port Quake to it. Use a GL, that makes use of all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; funny 264 features: fully pipelined FP, NVI instructions etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd rather all that effort be spent on a real application.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Put that system right *next* to a top-end x86 System using the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *same peripherals* ( important - same graphics ). Run the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; timedemo on both and see the Alpha fly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>That's a good idea only if the demo requires heavy FPU
<BR>
usage. Otherwise, the Intel/Athlon just might win.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now what ? I admit, that this demo will probably not sell a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *single* system to a coorperate customer, but it will generate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the perception of alpha being a superior platform among the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; game-kidies. magazines will love to see a system like that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being some sort of  top-end-games-reference machine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Give it as a free loaner for testing to the &quot;pc-mega-games&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; magazine ( or whatever they are called ).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with the idea of creating perceptions. That's
<BR>
what marketeers do.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You catch a trend here - the *only* reason, the average user
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is buying a faster x86 machine is for games. No one with some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brains would claim, that you need a 30+ SPECint95 800Mhz
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Athlon to run Word or Excel.
</EM><BR>
<P>Depending on the spreadsheet, it might actually be useful.
<BR>
You'd be amazed at what technical types put into them.
<BR>
<P>The only reason I buy fast x86's is to see where they're
<BR>
at relative to my other HW based on my own codes. So far, I'm
<BR>
not happy with their performance so I relegate them to chores
<BR>
like file servers/firewalls/print servers/X stations. If I had
<BR>
that level of performance on Intels's two years ago, I'd 
<BR>
probably be running on them but they lag state of the art
<BR>
performance. Alphas are, at this point state of the art, near
<BR>
as I can tell. At least when considering price/performance/
<BR>
space.
