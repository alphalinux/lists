<EM>&gt; I assume you mean 16MB simms?
</EM><BR>
<P>no -- he really means 12 meg.  only DEC would do a thing like that ;-)
<BR>
<P>my udb has a pair of 12s in the first bank and a pair of 32s in the
<BR>
second bank. it came with just the 24MB in the first bank, and i think
<BR>
that's where it likes the 12 meg simms to be.
<BR>
<P>at the moment my udb won't show any video when pwered on, but in the 3
<BR>
years in between it performed very well (for a udb).
<BR>
<P>on a side note, i tried cleaning the contacts on the simms (as per
<BR>
discussions here), and it booted once.  but the next morning i looked at
<BR>
it and the screen was totally green except for the white cursor in the
<BR>
lower left corner.  it hasnt shown me video since that.  i'm afraid that
<BR>
it's time has come ...
<BR>
<P>(better luck with yours!)
