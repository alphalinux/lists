<P>
Wade,
<BR>
<P>How difficult is very relative to how familar you are with linux in general and alphas in particular, esp. SRM and aboot.  The 2100's use SRM and aboot to load linux.  I have not worked with a 2100 on the newer kernels, but it used to require a special kernel for SMP support IIRC.  Check the FAQs and the howtos for SRM, aboot, SMP and the 2100's.  For aboot you will need to leave the first cylinder free for aboot (i.e. do not have it included in any partition).  On small disks (&lt;1Gb) you may need to leave more.
<BR>
<P>If you are new to alpha linux the alphalinux.org site is a good starting place.  The 2100 ev4 is sable and IIRC the 2100 ev5 is gamma-sable.  I believe you mentioned in another message that it was an Alphaserver 2100 5/375 which would make it a 2100 ev5  or gamma-sable machine.
<BR>
<P>Just FYI you could have also done a show config at the SRM prompt and figured out which one it is from that.  Although how difficult that would be depends on how familar you are with alpha hardware.  Or if you already had some OS (Digital Unix, VMS, NT,...) there are ways to tell from them.  But the simplest is just opening it up and looking.
<BR>
<P>Hope this helps.
<BR>
Good luck,
<BR>
<P>Calvin.

I popped open the machine to take a look at the card slots and it is the 8
<BR>
eisa and 3 pci slots board so I am assuming this is a true 2100. Thanks for
<BR>
the information on the slots Calvin...
<BR>
<P>How difficult is it to get a 2100 up and running Linux?  Is the installation
<BR>
pretty smooth or are there some things to know about?  Also will Linux
<BR>
recognize the multi processors with the vanilla installation or do I need to
<BR>
apply a special kernel for SMP support?
