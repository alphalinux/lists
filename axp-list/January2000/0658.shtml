<P>
I know that it needs to be in the first bank. Try reseating
<BR>
the RAM. I've had to do this a couple of times as it seems
<BR>
the Multia is finicky about this. Otherwise assume the RAM
<BR>
is faulty.

Subject: Added new Memory in UDB, but not recognized ... (Please help)
<BR>
<P><P>Hello axp Users
<BR>
I have a UDB - Box (Alpha AXPpci 33 board)
<BR>
I changed two of my 8 MB DEC-Memory into  two 12 MB DEC Memory Slots, but
<BR>
the
<BR>
UDB doesn't recognize the new
<BR>
memory. It always say: Testing from 8 to 32 MB.
<BR>
I tried all positions for the Memory banks. There is no difference.
<BR>
All the time 32 Memoy, but I have 40 MB.
<BR>
Are there any jumpers to set or firmware to upgrade. I have allready the
<BR>
latest firmware.
<BR>
Are there any memory tests possible?
<BR>
thanks in advance.
<BR>
MAX
