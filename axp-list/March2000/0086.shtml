<P>
<EM>&gt; The problem is that it's not just up to aboot, SRM would also have to know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about this, so you'd have to convince Q that's it's in their best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interest to add this stuff to SRM.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However, this makes more difficult for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the disributions right? At the moment if they see SRM they are safe to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; setup BSD and go on, if they see MILO in the serial number string then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they need to use PC partitions.
</EM><BR>
<P>No. Distributions could just change nothing, or you could give them the
<BR>
ability to detect SRM capable of dealing with DOS partitions.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; From my personal view, the last thing we need right now is to add
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something else that is going to make use/installation of Alpha any more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difficult.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree. However, there are usually technical ways to get around most
<BR>
installation difficulties. And the gain from being able to use DOS
<BR>
partitions will be substantial.
