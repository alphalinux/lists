<EM>&gt; Actually,  I e-mailed Daryll about this over 2 years ago and he said 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that Alpha was one of the things on his list that he hoped to get to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; soon.  This was well before glide was open sourced.  I'm not trying 
</EM><BR>
<P>A year ago, Daryll told me the same thing with the rider
<BR>
'some of the asm stuff needs to be ported'.  He seemed to indicate
<BR>
lack of communication from anyone in the AlphaLinux community.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; And which source are you refering to Dan?  Glide is now open sourced 
</EM><BR>
The message - per the subject and content - had to do with XFree86 4.0.   
<BR>
If you switch the subject in midstream, don't expect anyone else
<BR>
to follow. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; becoming less advantagous to get an Alpha over a much cheaper x86 box 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for my personal use.
</EM><BR>
You'll hear no argument from me on that point.  Alphas are not now 
<BR>
and probably never will be a platform for the general public.  
<BR>
In fact, most Alpha users I know also have a cheap x86 for games.
<BR>
<P>It sounds like you are going through a crisis of faith or something
<BR>
on the issue of using the Alpha platform.  This is probably not
<BR>
a good forum to vent on, and I have better things to do than 
<BR>
discuss your personal platform choice.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
