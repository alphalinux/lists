<P>
There are some big misconceptions here.  First, a DPWS can't be upgraded to
<BR>
&quot;anywhere near the performance&quot; of an XP1000 no matter what speed processor
<BR>
you put in it.  Second, your cost figures are the figment of someone's very
<BR>
active imagination.  This is a popular game even within computer
<BR>
manufacturers.  You get two groups competing, with one saying &quot;Oh, we could
<BR>
build it for 1/2 that cost.&quot;  If you actually do the homework and total up
<BR>
the actual costs, reality starts to take hold.
<BR>
<P>So, how about providing us the backup data for your cost figures?  (Just to
<BR>
be even handed, I bet when you do the cost figures, you'll find your
<BR>
warranty allowance is too high assuming that's what you mean by &quot;support
<BR>
contract&quot;).

<EM>&gt; 1. You can buy a &quot;new&quot; DPWS 500a (factory config, 128M ram, 4.3G etc.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at auction or on the used market for less than $700, often available
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for close to $500.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2. You can buy a new XP1000 (500Mhz 21264, 4M cache, 128M ram, etc.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from Q starting at $7200.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3. The price of upgrading the system in point #1 to anywhere near 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the performance (yeah, yeah.. I know 600Mhz 21164A != 500Mhz 21264) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the system in point #2 is almost the cost of system #2.  
</EM><BR>
<P>You can't get a DPWS to have &quot;anywhere near the performance&quot; of an
<BR>
XP1000, no matter what speed CPU you put in it (unless you consider
<BR>
50-60% &quot;near&quot;).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Here's another thought.  Guess how much it costs Compaq to put together
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a 500Mhz EV6 with motherboard? $500.  Which means the total system cost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to them (given market alliances etc.) could be had around $1200.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Throw in a support contract, and you're around $1500.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The cost to consumer is not twice, not thrice, but at least 5 times
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their build cost.  One heck of a profit, but I wonder how long Q
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can keep up that game with folks like API and other ISVs in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market?
</EM><BR>
<P>That's an interesting thought.  Conspiracy theories are always good
<BR>
fodder to get the masses riled up.  Of course, it would be even more
<BR>
interesting if it had some basis in fact.  Do you have real world cost
<BR>
figures to back up your assertion?  If the cost figures are real, can 
<BR>
you get me a list of the suppliers?  I'd like to buy my parts at the
<BR>
same places (and prices!).
