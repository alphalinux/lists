<P>
Actually,  I e-mailed Daryll about this over 2 years ago and he said 
<BR>
that Alpha was one of the things on his list that he hoped to get to 
<BR>
soon.  This was well before glide was open sourced.  I'm not trying 
<BR>
to point a finger at people like Daryll, who at the time was doing 
<BR>
this in his free time.  From what I understand, glide has been found 
<BR>
to be particularly troublesome to port to Alpha.  
<BR>
<P>On the GLX front, I have found hardly any info as to what is actually 
<BR>
supported under Alpha.  Most of my beef is with hardware vendors and 
<BR>
their x86 centric support.  I can understand why this is so from the  
<BR>
economics view of these companies.  What really bugs me is that much 
<BR>
of the design philosophy behind recent hardware makes getting it to 
<BR>
work on an Alpha particularly difficult.  How many of the recent 
<BR>
consumer 3D cards work under Alpha/Linux?  Hell,  Nvidias newest 
<BR>
cards won't work at all due to the bios translation on Alpha not 
<BR>
supporting them.  
<BR>
<P>I have tried being vocal on several mailing lists and boards to try 
<BR>
and rally support but at most I usually get a couple of followups 
<BR>
which say 'yah, that would be nice'.  
<BR>
<P>And which source are you refering to Dan?  Glide is now open sourced 
<BR>
but the response I received from someone at 3dfx (I believe it was on 
<BR>
the linux-glide newsgroup but I don't remember who it was) when I 
<BR>
inquired about whether they intended to port glide to Alpha/Linux was 
<BR>
&quot;It is being worked on by the open souce community but they are having 
<BR>
a lot of problems&quot;.  
<BR>
<P>Compaq and API are not helping matters either.  It is getting terribly 
<BR>
difficult to find a decent video card which still comes in pci format.  
<BR>
API now offers 1 Alpha motherboard with an agp slot - the UP1000.  Have 
<BR>
you seen the prices on these things?  Regardless of their cries of 
<BR>
'commodity Alpha', Alpha will continue to be a niche market under this 
<BR>
type of marketing.  I have been touting the advantages of Alpha since 
<BR>
I first worked on a DEC300-600 in graduate school, and have owned more 
<BR>
than a few in the last 4-5 years, but unless I am running Monte Carlo 
<BR>
simulations or Data analysis a significant fraction of the time, it is 
<BR>
becoming less advantagous to get an Alpha over a much cheaper x86 box 
<BR>
for my personal use.

<EM>&gt; &gt; This is just too typical.  I fear that Alpha will never have real 3D

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; over this.  All I wan't is to be able to play glquake when I'm not

<EM>&gt; As the saying goes, 'Use the source!'.  If you have an aptitude for

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tell people like Darryl Strauss who mess with graphics that you

<EM>&gt; Phil Ezolt just volunteered to set up a games/demos segment
