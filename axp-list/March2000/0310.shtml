<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Is this from AlphaBIOS or SRM, I'm assuming because of your earlier
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; question that this is AlphaBIOS? If you attach a terminal to the 1st
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; serial port your should see the output of AlphaBIOS. Though I will warn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; you that serial support in AlphaBIOS isn't the most useful thing I've ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; come across. If you're going to attempt this then I'd get the latest AB
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; available (5.70), and if you really want serial support, use SRM.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Hm, I think you didn't get me right!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't _want_ to use is, but I sometimes need to boot the system without a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; keyboard.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; BUT this doesn't work! Allways I unplug the keyboard and boot, the system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; definitly does not boot! Why?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Do you have AlphaBIOS setup to autoboot? Again this could be a problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with AlphaBIOS and serial support. The only way your going to find out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what's going on is to plug into the serial port.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I've been there and done that, folks.  I have small cluster of LX machines
<BR>
that I originally tried to set up using AlphaBios.  I set up the AlphaBios
<BR>
for autoboot, but discovered, much to my dismay, that the autoboot flag
<BR>
is ignored when the keyboard is unplugged and the Alphabios starts sending
<BR>
its output to the serial port.  If you plug in a dumb terminal to the
<BR>
serial port, which I did, you'll find that it gives you some kind of
<BR>
prompt and waits for you to tell it to go ahead and boot.
<BR>
<P>Yes, this is a SERIOUS, STUPID BUG in the AlphaBios, at least for someone
<BR>
trying to set up a beowulf cluster.  I made some exasperated calls to DEC
<BR>
at the time (late 1997), and even offered to the fix the bug for them if
<BR>
they'd give me a crack at the code, but, of course, that was not in the
<BR>
cards.
<BR>
<P>The only fix I know of is to switch to SRM, which I did.
<BR>
<P>HTH,
<BR>
