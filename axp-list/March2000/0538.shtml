<P>The .got section stores addresses of symbols.  It consists of a
<BR>
number of subsections, each limited to 64k, because that's how
<BR>
much one can address with one memory instruction.  Each object
<BR>
file may reference only one of these subsections, thus each object
<BR>
file is limited to 64k.
<BR>
<P>As to why your code requires so many symbol address loads, one
<BR>
would have to examine the code to be sure.
<BR>
<P>Note that there are several techniques that can be applied to
<BR>
reduce the number of symbol addresses needed by a program.  GCC
<BR>
does not employ all of these, mostly because GAS lacks the ability
<BR>
to emit all of the relocations.  Since CCC emits object files
<BR>
directly, it does not suffer from this restriction.  You may have
<BR>
better success with that.  Of course, Compaq's C++ compiler isn't
<BR>
released yet, but I recently heard noises about &quot;soon&quot;.
<BR>
<P>There are also .got reduction strategies that can be done at link
<BR>
time.  You might try getting the most recent binutils (2.9.5.0.31?)
<BR>
and using `g++ -Wl,-relax'.
