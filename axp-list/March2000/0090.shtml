<EM>&gt; &gt; However, this makes more difficult for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the disributions right? At the moment if they see SRM they are safe to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; setup BSD and go on, if they see MILO in the serial number string then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; they need to use PC partitions.
</EM><BR>
<P>Indeed, this is exactly what I am doing for the next Debian release.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No. Distributions could just change nothing, or you could give them the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ability to detect SRM capable of dealing with DOS partitions.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm pretty sure that SRM capable of dealing with DOS partition tables
<BR>
(note that SRM has no concept of partitions - this is entirely up to
<BR>
the secondary bootstrap) is never going to happen [1], because it
<BR>
would break the Alpha architecture specification, specifically the
<BR>
console subsystem specification, which SRM follows.  You might as well
<BR>
ask, &quot;why don't we have an AlphaBIOS that understands BSD disklabels&quot;,
<BR>
or better yet, &quot;why don't we ditch this stupid PC-BIOS on i386 and get
<BR>
some real firmware, so we can partition our disks and boot however we
<BR>
like&quot;. [2]
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I don't really want to use DOS partitions.  The only reason
<BR>
Linux uses them on i386 is to interoperate with the &quot;native&quot; operating
<BR>
system on that platform and the firmware that supports it (ditto with
<BR>
Alphas that boot from ARC).  That's why we use Sun disklabels on Suns,
<BR>
SGI disklabels on SGIs, Macintosh partition tables on Macs, and so on.
<BR>
<P>The only reason that DOS partitions are better is because of the
<BR>
poor state of the existing tools for dealing with other partitioning
<BR>
schemes.  On Alpha, we got used to using them since we had MILO and
<BR>
Windows NT.  Now we don't have MILO or Windows NT anymore, and we'll
<BR>
have to learn to be like the other non-Intel platforms.  In the end I
<BR>
think this is a win.
<BR>
<P>It's in fact a lot *easier* to write an fdisk-type program for OSF,
<BR>
Sun, or SGI disklabels, or for Macintosh partition tables, than it is
<BR>
to write one for DOS partition tables, because you don't have to deal
<BR>
with the extended/logical partition madness, or with the antiquated
<BR>
CHS specifications for size and placement of partitions, or arbitrary
<BR>
PC-BIOS limitations on these (wholly artificial) numbers you have to
<BR>
abide by in order to be backwards-compatible with 16-bit toy operating
<BR>
systems and the broken firmware they rely on.
<BR>
<P>BSD on i386 really has the worst of both worlds, since it has to put a
<BR>
BSD disklabel *inside* a DOS partition in order to be bootable from
<BR>
the PC-BIOS, and the problems with Linux fdisk's BSD label support on
<BR>
Alpha are somewhat related to this. [3]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I agree. However, there are usually technical ways to get around most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installation difficulties. And the gain from being able to use DOS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; partitions will be substantial.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, the gain from fixing the partitioning tools to work better with
<BR>
the different partition formats on the various platforms will be
<BR>
substantial.  It will also have benefits for all architectures, not
<BR>
just Alpha. [4]
<BR>
<P>[1] David Woodhouse pointed out to me that you can, with some twisted
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hackery, create a valid DOS partition table and still boot from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SRM; it involves twiddling the empty spaces (er, &quot;Reserved to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digital&quot; spaces :) in the boot block so that the most significant
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;halfword of the bootblock checksum is 0xAA55 - also you can't use
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fourth primary partition since it overlaps with the rest of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the checksum.  (Hm, in fact, since the 0xAA55 magic number isn't
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;really required to boot on an Alpha (no PC-BIOS), so long as Linux
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understood that it was optional on Alpha, we could actually do
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this - but I don't want to give anyone any ideas :)
<BR>
<P>[2] Actually, people have done that in the past (SGI Visual
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workstations, which are i386 boxen that use ARC), and are now
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doing it *right* (VA Research's &quot;ROMulus&quot; project, and LANL's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;LinuxBIOS&quot; project)
<BR>
<P>[3] IMHO we should treat OSF disklabels as a separate type, like we do
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for Sun, SGI, and AIX labels, but this is kind of irrelevant
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because Linux fdisk really needs to be put out of its misery at
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this point.
<BR>
<P>[4] In fact, I'm working on something like this, namely, a universal
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disk-partitioning library and accompanying utility, in my Copious
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free Time, probably by filling out the (read-only, but
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multiplatform) libfdisk that resides in Debian boot-floppies.
