<EM>&gt; Well, the reason this whole mess cropped up was that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; framebuffer-code was being reworked for 4.0 and keithp thought it'd be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; easier if one could use Memory-mapped I/O. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Um, do you mean memory-mapped registers? It already did in cases where
<BR>
it had to (Millennium for one).
<BR>
<P>If you mean framebuffer references, just remember that (almost) all
<BR>
machines before PYXIS can ONLY use DENSE, and it MUST be aligned,
<BR>
which would preclude the use of byte/short, or make it more
<BR>
complicated to tell when you *could* use it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; BTW, is the sparse mapping somewhat related to the actual PCI-id on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bus ? 'cause if it were we wouldn't need to map the whole 16G but rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that portion corresponding to the card. The PCI information is obtained
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyway, so that won't be a problem.
</EM><BR>
<P>Egbert changed that area (lnx_video.c memory mapping), I think for some
<BR>
reasons associated with multi-head, to map the *entire* PCI DENSE and
<BR>
(not quite all of) SPARSE, from the earlier, only-what-is-needed method.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But that means another release of GLibc, and the distribution of that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can take _ages_. Nice as it were, though.
</EM><BR>
<P>No; the idea is to make new kernel system calls, that GLIBC and user
<BR>
apps can then make to get the same (and more) info that GLIBC gets
<BR>
indirectly (/proc/cpuinfo) and manages itself now. It could be done
<BR>
without GLIBC involvement initially, ie just a package in
<BR>
os-support/linux that recognizes enhanced kernels and uses info from
<BR>
there directly.
