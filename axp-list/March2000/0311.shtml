<P>It is discouraging that there isn't 3D support for Alpha yet.  But, as I
<BR>
was reading through the documentation at xfree.org I saw a couple of
<BR>
interesting things.  Some quotes:
<BR>
<P>&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
&quot;Unlike XFree86 3.3.x where there are multiple X server binaries, each
<BR>
of which drive different hardware, XFree86 4.0 has a single X server
<BR>
binary called XFree86. This binary can either have one or more video
<BR>
drivers linked in statically, or, more usually, dynamically load the
<BR>
video drivers and other modules that are needed. . . .
<BR>
<P>&quot;The XFree86 X server has a built-in run-time loader, donated by Metro
<BR>
Link.&quot;
<BR>
&lt;/snip&gt;
<BR>
<P>I thought it was really strange that Metro Link would give this work to
<BR>
an open source competitor.  Then I realized what they want out of this
<BR>
and what this has given the X community.  With modules Metro Link and
<BR>
other X driver programmers can use XFree as the core server and then
<BR>
just write better modules that they can sell to users as they need
<BR>
them.  No need to have a long complex install of entire X
<BR>
distribution, just download the small module and run the configuration
<BR>
script and you have support for your wiz bang new video card.
<BR>
<P>Metro X has shown support for Alpha in the past.  And I would be very
<BR>
happy to spend $50 to $100 for an accelerated 3D module.  And this
<BR>
seems to be where everyone will be going.  You just go to
<BR>
metrolink.com, enter your credit card number, and download the
<BR>
module.  Compaq, API, or the graphics card manufactures can also write
<BR>
their own modules and have them available for download.  It just seems
<BR>
that module writing will be much more simple than X-Server writing.
<BR>
<P>I might even lower the bar (in programming skills) so that more people
<BR>
can contribute to open source modules.  Just my opinion.  Anyone else
<BR>
think this makes sense?
