I ended up just using the symbios driver, I don't know the history
<BR>
behind the two but the symbios looked to be almost identical (though
<BR>
it had the base_io member defined :).  I think I had to change a few
<BR>
other things as well, mincore was not defined anywhere and sys_madvise
<BR>
was not defined either.  Both of those are in the entry.S file and
<BR>
ended up as undefined references at link time.  I didn't have time to
<BR>
look into what either of those are before leaving work.  I did get it
<BR>
compiled and running on an ES40 before leaving, though.  This is the
<BR>
first kernel I've used after the IRQ rewrite, but it seemed like
<BR>
response time is a little slower when there is heavy disk activity.
<BR>
Also, is there a reason that there is never an IRQ handled on CPU 3
<BR>
(the last CPU)?

<EM>&gt; Yes, I saw this too.  I worked around it, but it appears that
