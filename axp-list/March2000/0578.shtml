<P><EM>&gt;But you (and several other people) have mentioned that

<EM>&gt;RedHat 6.0 on a Jensen doesn't work very well.  The

<P>RedHat runs on Jensen Boards, no doubt on this. Though, there are still some
<BR>
things that must be patched:
<BR>
<P>- There is a bug in the 2.2.x-Kernels that makes programs using the
<BR>
&quot;floor&quot;-method (for example all GTK-programs or ghostscript) hang on
<BR>
EV4-machines. You will find the patch against that at
<BR>

<BR>
- I had problems running the X-Server for S3-cards on my Jensen board. You
<BR>
will find the package with the working X-Server for S3 cards at

<A HREF="ftp://alpha.kawo1.rwth-aachen.de/alpha/RPMS">ftp://alpha.kawo1.rwth-aachen.de/alpha/RPMS</A> (just in case that you have the
<BR>
same machine as me ...)
<BR>
<P>Except of this RedHat runs pretty well on a Jensen board and it is a good
<BR>
choice (next to D*****-Linux which runs also very well on that machine). One
<BR>
more advantage of RedHat Linux is that Netscape and the Compaq C-Compiler are
<BR>
available as rpm-packages for this architecture.
<BR>
<P>If you need a machine for Alpha-Linux development RedHat on Jensen is not a bad
<BR>
choice (at least this is my opinion) .... at least much much better than
<BR>
nothing! They only thing that is complicated is the installation of
<BR>
RedHat-Linux on these boards 8-(
