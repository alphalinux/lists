My DEC PW 433a came with an awesome *looking* videocard. I wasn't able to
<BR>
configure X to run with it, so I put in a Matrox Millenium II and it works
<BR>
great. Still, I'm curious about this card. I tried to do some web research
<BR>
to figure out exactly what it is, with no success. Here's what it looks
<BR>
like:
<BR>
<P>It's a dual PCI card -- it takes up two side-by-side PCI slots.
<BR>
It has two 15-pin monitor outs and one DIN TV-out
<BR>
It redefines the term &quot;full-length&quot;
<BR>
It has TWO 168-pin DIMM sockets
<BR>
It has three black pointy heat sinks
<BR>
It has a Cirrus Logic GD5440 chip on it (and more I can't read)
<BR>
It has &quot;Intergraph Computer Systems&quot; written all over it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[Intergraph has a inpenetrable website]
<BR>
It has a 60-pin (?) IDE-like socket
<BR>
<P>Any clues to what make/model it might be would be appreciated. Thanks!!
<BR>
