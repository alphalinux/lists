Fab cost isn't everything. R&amp;D, advertising, promotion, etc... -- these monies
<BR>
all have to be recovered somehow. There's no real way to judge just how much the
<BR>
chip really ought to cost without knowning how much money was actually spent on
<BR>
the entire project. And $500 is a lot, if it's just for fab, so there's it's no
<BR>
wonder the chip is so expensive.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Gentlemen,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Regarding this thread about fab costs. The figures for the cost of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; manufacture came from me in a private conversation between Dan and Myself.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The actual figures told to me by a trusted friend that is in the &quot;computer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; business&quot; but works outside of Compaq/API. The costs for the chips was a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; quote from a silcon fab that given X transitors, RISC design, and Y
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; complexity that this is how much it would cost. Around $500. The board not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; included. That is fact. Whether that is the &quot;actual&quot; fab cost of an Alpha?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I can only speculate. I am very sorry for the disruption this has caused
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in the Alphalinux community and in the future I will make sure that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; private information does not end up on this list or any other list ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; again.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That info isn't so private. I remember reading a similar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; number in one of my weekly trade magazines that put 21264's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in $400-$500 price range. I've never seen a number for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; motherboard/chipset though so I didn't comment on the thread.
