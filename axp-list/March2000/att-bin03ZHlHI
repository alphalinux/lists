Hello.


: What is the best 3d card that the alpha supports?


As far as I know, xfree86 3.3.x does not support hardware 3D acceleration

for Alpha/AXP architecture. Neither AcceleratedX nor Metro-X.


When I just compiled xfree86 3.9.17, the drivers built are the following


	s3virge, tga, rendition, vga, mga, glint, tdfx


Strangely, ati is not included.



For speed of 2D, Matrox G200 seems to be much faster than Xpert@Play.


:	why isn't this kinda thing in the alpha FAQ ?


I wonder, too. What is also strange is that RedHat 6.1 Manual (Alpha/SPARC

Installation Addendum page 29) does not say that Matrox G200 is supported.
