<EM>&gt; Not correct. Cypress IDE DMA does affect the ISA bus, not PCI.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For example, PCI audio cards work fine with Cypress IDE.
</EM><BR>
<P>Would you care to explain just how the PCI Cypress device would only
<BR>
affect the ISA bus?
<BR>
<P>Your example may very well hold true, but it does not prove your
<BR>
theory. How much FIFO do you have in respective sound card, how
<BR>
large transfers are done through the PCI-&gt;ISA bridge, etc. ?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; If I do 64kB block DMA from the disk and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; play audio at the same time, the audio output is garbled by FIFO underrun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in the audio card's DMA. It sounds a little as if the audio is played at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a too low and instable sample rate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's known problem with the Cypress chip. Try reducing BUSMASTER_TIMEOUT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; value in drivers/ide/cy82c693.c
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok, you're right, the card doesn't do a full 64kB transfer, it only
<BR>
transfers 0x50 32-bit words (I guess) per transfer. How many PCI cycles
<BR>
this means, I don't know. Probably more.
<BR>
<P>Yes, I can fix my audio garbling by reducing the BUSMASTER_TIMEOUT to
<BR>
0x14 and getting lousy IDE performance. 0x16 still gives me some audible
<BR>
sound garbling.
<BR>
<P>This solution however is much worse than being able to set the PCI latency
<BR>
of a device. The idea with the latency timer is that each busmastering
<BR>
device may ATLEAST get X cycles for each PCI transfers and after this
<BR>
other devices that wants to use the bus may interrupt the ongoing
<BR>
transfer. If no device wants the bus, the first transfer may continue
<BR>
until the master latency timeout occurs (i.e. 65280 PCI cycles with the
<BR>
default PYXIS setting).
<BR>
<P>This means that in cases where only one device is using the bus, high
<BR>
transfer rate is achieved. When some device needs frequent bus access, it
<BR>
gets in to the penelty of transfer rate. I like this much better than
<BR>
limiting all transfers!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't know about bttv, but other hardware you listed should work fine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the latest kernels.
</EM><BR>
<P>All devices work by them self, it's when I combine them I run into
<BR>
problems.

<P>Thanks for pointing out the BUSMASTER_TIMEOUT define.
