Hello
<BR>
I have a stock AS3300 running RH Linux 6.1, and I have run into quite a few
<BR>
interesting problems
<BR>
<P>I upgraded to kernel 2.2.14 to try and solve some problems that I am having
<BR>
with the machine, namely:
<BR>
-you have to compile the kernel as generic to get the keyboard / mouse to
<BR>
actually work. Compiling straight away as noritake-primo makes the system
<BR>
drop the keyboard / mouse as soon as the kernel boots
<BR>
<P>-the machine just locks up for no aparent reason. The only way that I could
<BR>
get to the machine was by telnet, and then it would just stop responding.
<BR>
The machine would not go back down to SRM when it locked. The syslogs show
<BR>
nothing about why the lock occurred
<BR>
<P>-changed the NIC from the DE500 (21143) that was in it to a 21140 based card
<BR>
(Netgear) to see if it was the NIC that was giving me problems. The original
<BR>
nic (DE500) refused to jump to FDX on my hub, but the same card on a FreeBSD
<BR>
box (my 164SX which I pulled the netgear card from) runs it fine and makes
<BR>
the swap to FDX without a problem. If I force that particular port on the
<BR>
hub to FDX, the NIC re-aligns and works at FDX....
<BR>
<P>anyone have any ideas as to why any of this is happening?
<BR>
I'm tempted to install FreeBSD on it to see if it locks up then. (I still
<BR>
have like 2 weeks to return it if it's defective)
<BR>
<P>the AS3300 has 64MB of RAM in it,
<BR>
2 18.2G 10k UW compaq drives
<BR>
1 4.3G 10k UW compaq drive
<BR>
<P>Thanks
<BR>
