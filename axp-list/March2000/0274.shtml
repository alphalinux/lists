<P>
<EM>&gt; but just what does that kit contain? Is it just the cpu? Can you put any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ev56 into these things? or is there some special card it's attached to?
</EM><BR>
<P>Its both a 'classic-&gt;enhanced' MLB upgrade kit and the cpu/cache combo.
<BR>
The enhanced DPWS boxes have two USB ports and probably some subtle 
<BR>
improvements.
<BR>
<P>The point thats sticking in my mind is this:
<BR>
1. You can buy a &quot;new&quot; DPWS 500a (factory config, 128M ram, 4.3G etc.)
<BR>
at auction or on the used market for less than $700, often available
<BR>
for close to $500. 
<BR>
<P>2. You can buy a new XP1000 (500Mhz 21264, 4M cache, 128M ram, etc.)
<BR>
from Q starting at $7200.
<BR>
<P>3. The price of upgrading the system in point #1 to anywhere near 
<BR>
the performance (yeah, yeah.. I know 600Mhz 21164A != 500Mhz 21264) 
<BR>
of the system in point #2 is almost the cost of system #2.  
<BR>
<P>The small business/hobbyist who picked up an older-gen Miata may as well
<BR>
buy a brand new XP1000.  Its a smooth marketing strategy which otherwise
<BR>
stinks.
<BR>
<P>Here's another thought.  Guess how much it costs Compaq to put together
<BR>
a 500Mhz EV6 with motherboard? $500.  Which means the total system cost
<BR>
to them (given market alliances etc.) could be had around $1200.  
<BR>
Throw in a support contract, and you're around $1500.  
<BR>
The cost to consumer is not twice, not thrice, but at least 5 times
<BR>
their build cost.  One heck of a profit, but I wonder how long Q
<BR>
can keep up that game with folks like API and other ISVs in the
<BR>
market?
