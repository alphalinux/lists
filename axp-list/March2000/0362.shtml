<P>This is the correct approach.

<P>On some systems symlinks aren't even separate objects but merely
<BR>
special directory entries (thus no inode, no perms, no ownership etc).
<BR>
Almost every system call follows symlinks, including things like chown
<BR>
and chmod. While this makes a certain warped sense because nothing you
<BR>
do to perms on a symlink will really affect security (since you can
<BR>
always just use the path the link uses direct), I think it's horrible.
<BR>
IMHO, the only system calls which should follow symlinks are stat, open
<BR>
and chdir.
<BR>
<P>Then you could do the old &quot;chmod -R&quot; etc without fear of a rogue symlink.
<BR>
Instead one has to say uglinesses like
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find . ! -type l -exec chown blah {} ';'
<BR>
to avoid treading on things outside the namespace. Very grody.
<BR>
