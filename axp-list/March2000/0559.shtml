<EM>&gt;I am having significant problems installing RedHat 6.0
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on a Jensen I've got sitting here.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Ohh yesss ... that took me several weeks! Ok, that time it was RedHat 5.2, but
<BR>
I don't know whether it became better inbetween.
<BR>
1.) I dropped my usual kernel that I am using at
<BR>
<A HREF="ftp://alph.kawo1.rwth-aachen.de/vmlinux">ftp://alph.kawo1.rwth-aachen.de/vmlinux</A>
<BR>
The kernel there is a little fat for an installer system, but maybe it works
<BR>
fine for you. You won't be able to put this kernel on one disk. But you can
<BR>
connect the harddisc that you want to use for the installation on another
<BR>
computer and put that kernel with dd on it (right after aboot for example to
<BR>
make it loadable by the raw loader).
<BR>
<P>2.) With one version (I don't know exactly which) RedHat stepped down
<BR>
with the used partition format from BSD-Disklabel to the buggy PC-Partioning
<BR>
scheme (biiiigg mistake!! I hope they reverted that step again). If this is
<BR>
still the case for RedHat 6.0 you won't be able to partition your hard drive
<BR>
such, that the SRM console can boot from it ... you can, but it is tricky!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I've found quite a few different sets of instructions,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;each with slightly different requirements.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;farthest I've ever gotten is getting the kernel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;booted, but then it doesn't like the ramdisk I give it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(&quot;unable to mount root fs&quot;).  
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course booting the ramdisk is the first important thing that must work. The
<BR>
problems I just described come after the ramdisk is booted.
<BR>
Which arguments do you give to the kernel?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'm current following these instructions:
</EM><BR>

<P>You may also check out these sites:

<BR>
<P>You will find bootdiscs, ramdiscs and firmwares in these folders too!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Why those?  Because they supply some (supposedly)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;recent kernel/ramdisk files.  However, even these do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not work.  After I copy the kernel to the HD and try
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to boot with it I get &quot;?02 KSP INVAL&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Looks like the checksum is invalid. Which minlabel have you used to partition
<BR>
the harddrive?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Is this firmware related?  I can't figure out how to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tell what firmware it's running now AND when I try to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;install 1.7 (blowing away the unknown existing ver) I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;get a checksum error.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is possible but very difficult to install a RedHat system from floppy disks.
<BR>
The best way would really to put the harddisc in a computer that already runs
<BR>
linux.
<BR>
You could use minlabel on this computer to partition the harddisc. After that
<BR>
you could make an ext2-Filesystem on the first partition just to drop a kernel.
<BR>
Than you could also use swriteboot on that computer to write the aboot-utility
<BR>
on the harddisc very comfortably (you will find some hints about how to do this
<BR>
in the SRM Firmware Howto at <A HREF="http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/srm.html">http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/srm.html</A>).
<BR>
<P>And where did you get the firmware 1.7 from? As long as the checksum of the
<BR>
first block of the harddisc is correct and the two variables (start of aboot
<BR>
and end of aboot) are set correctly (AFAIK swriteboot should make that
<BR>
automatically) Firmware 1.7 should load aboot. Try the option
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; SET BOOT_OSFLAG i
</EM><BR>
<P>And look whether he load aboot and aboot prompts for a command. If this works
<BR>
fine you don't have any problem with the firmware.
<BR>
The next check is to load a kernel with aboot, take a look at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/srm-4.html!">http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/srm-4.html!</A>
<BR>
If all those jensen boot kernels that you find don't work try it with the one
<BR>
at my site (it is actually a modularized kernel, but the basic functionality
<BR>
should be there without the modules too).
<BR>
If the ramdisc doesn't start from floppy disc try extracting the ram disc on a
<BR>
usual partition on the hard disc and use this partition as root partition.
<BR>
And then from which media do you want to install RedHat Linux from? From CD or
<BR>
from the Internet over FTP?
<BR>
Hmm, I hope this helps ...
