Hi there! I am also one of the users with one of those antique Jensen
<BR>
boards which cause a lot of confusion all the time. I must first send out
<BR>
compliments to everybody who contributed to the solid implementation of
<BR>
the &quot;Jensen_&quot; methods in the glibc and the XFree86 source tree which
<BR>
eventually make a clean operation of this architecture possible. Though
<BR>
the Xserver source is well prepared to run on Jensen boards (as mentioned
<BR>
all methods needed are present) the S3-Server that comes with the RedHat
<BR>
rpm is compiled with the assembly option &quot;-m21164&quot; from the spec-file. It
<BR>
seams that some pal calls are created this way that are not supported by
<BR>
21064 chips. Anyway my machine crashes when I try to start the Xserver
<BR>
that comes with the usual RedHat package from the RawHide distribution
<BR>
(the method is s3QueryBestSize and the assembly dump just contains callpal
<BR>
and halt instructions which doesn't really make sense for a code that is
<BR>
supposed to run correctly).
<BR>
Can someone compile it once more with the assembly option &quot;-m21064&quot; and
<BR>
the compile option &quot;-mcpu=ev4&quot;? I did that on a computer of one of my
<BR>
friends and the XServer works fine with these options. Unfortunately he is
<BR>
using a ******-Distribution that has the __??register_frame_info* methods
<BR>
in the common libc.6.1.so and not in the libstdc++-libc6.1-2.so as it is
<BR>
the case in the RedHat distribution. Thus I had to compile the Server
<BR>
statically and now it consumes about 5M space on my harddisc which is
<BR>
almost full. I so and so prefer a dynamically linked X-Server ...
<BR>
I would compile the X-Package by myself if I had enough space on my
<BR>
harddisc to do this. That's why I'm asking somebody else to do it. After
<BR>
the rpm ran through the rpm could be stripped out as
<BR>
XFree86-S3-jensen-3.3.6-??.alpha.rpm for example, so that all Jensen users
<BR>
get their Xserver for RedHat (AFAIK the Winner1000 graphics board is the
<BR>
only one that runs well on Jensen and that is found on most Jensen
<BR>
boards).
<BR>
Another hint I can give is using the switch &quot;AutoRepeat 0 0&quot;. My XServer
<BR>
hangs without this option because my keyboard doesn't seam to support the
<BR>
switching of the keyboard repeat rate (it is an AT keyboard with a PS/2
<BR>
adapter). I don't know whether this is also necessary for PS/2 keyboards.
<BR>
Best regards ...
