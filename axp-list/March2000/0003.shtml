I was just doing what the SRM faq says
<BR>
(<A HREF="http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/srm-1.html">http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/srm-1.html</A>), &quot;... If your Alpha system starts
<BR>
up with AlphaBIOS, or some other firmware, then this document is not for
<BR>
you.&quot; Other than that, MILO seemed pretty easy and so did the alphabios
<BR>
setup. It's just the loading of the kernel.

<P><P>I prefer to install from the SRM disks and then use milo to boot, if I am
<BR>
going to use milo at all, after it is installed.  I never had any luck with
<BR>
the MILO and installation.  I figuered it was me and just stuck with what
<BR>
worked best - SRM.  I have a PWS433.  Why all the trouble for MILO anyway?
<BR>
The consensus on the list seems to be pro-SRM, for what appears to be a long
<BR>
list of good reason.  Just curious.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Let's look at what works first:
&gt; You've got a good boot disk that pulls milo in.  That's the first step,
&gt; stick with it.
&gt; 
&gt; Next step is to load a working kernel.  IIRC, milo can handle both
&gt; ext2 and msdos filesystems.  Try copying a kernel image to a 
&gt; dos-formatted disk with the copy command under nt.  Then boot milo,
&gt; stick the new kernel floppy in, and tell it:
&gt; boot fd0:kernelname.gz (where kernelname.gz=your copied image).
&gt; At this point it should gripe mightily about mounting the root
&gt; partition.  That's fine.  If it says it can't load the kernel, it
&gt; may well be a milo problem.  Else, continue...
&gt; 
&gt; Once you've gotten this far, you should be able to cold-boot back into
&gt; milo, put your kernel disk back in, and at the milo prompt 
&gt; say boot fd0:kernelname.gz root=/dev/hda.
&gt; 
&gt; A full description of your hardware would be helpful.  Also, do you
&gt; have a partition roughly 2xmemory in size for swap?  axp kernels
&gt; normally expect the root partition to be /dev/sda2, so you'd want
&gt; your disk to have
&gt; sda1=small loader ptn
&gt; sda2=big root ptn
&gt; sda3=2xram swap
&gt; 
&gt; ...and why the sda5?......
&gt; HTH,

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Remember that you should have at least a 2 megs. partition (windows fat)
&gt; at
&gt; &gt; the first part of your harddrive because you are going to install the
&gt; miata
&gt; &gt; on that partition.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Boot your Alpha with milo
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; At the milo prompt Insert the generic kernel into the floppy and type:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; boot fd0:vmlinux.gz root=/dev/hda0     
&gt; &gt;
