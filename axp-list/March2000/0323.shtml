<P>Right, Unless your a systems integrator or similar that gets spammed with
<BR>
all kinds of trade magizines you wouldn't know. The average customer
<BR>
wouldn't know. You can figure out the cost of a MB/chip by comparing it to
<BR>
what they're selling them for. For example. The UP1000 developer system
<BR>
goes for $3000. figure a 5% profit margin and cost of parts (which aint
<BR>
much) and you can get a ball park price of maybe $2000-$2500 for a UP1000
<BR>
board and chip. Now figure how much does the reseller pay for these? I
<BR>
believe if they could sell Alpha's cheap they would so &quot;they&quot; must be
<BR>
paying almost the same price if not alittle less. so API/Q is selling this
<BR>
thing high and the resellers are selling them high back to us. 
<BR>
<P>If the high price is atributed to R&amp;D and so I suggest they eat it and
<BR>
start selling in volume. Linux users want Alphas... the they see the price
<BR>
tag.. and then they ask about the Athlon. With 900MHz Athlons coming they
<BR>
may not bother asking about the Alpha at all anymore.
