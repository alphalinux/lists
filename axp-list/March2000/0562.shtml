Hi all,
<BR>
<P>I have a question about porting to Alpha.
<BR>
<P>I notice that there are various types of machines, all of which fall under
<BR>
the category of &quot;alpha&quot; -- for example, in the config.guess of gcc 2.95.2,
<BR>
it checks if it's running on alpha vs. alphaev5 vs. alphaev56, etc.
<BR>
<P>Are there compatibility issues between different alpha boxes?  For example,
<BR>
for Applixware, the build machine which we currently use for releases is
<BR>
an EV56 machine, according to /proc/cpuinfo, while another machine which we
<BR>
use for QA and stuff is a PCA56 machine.  We don't seem to have any
<BR>
problems running the same software on both machines, but now we've heard
<BR>
from a few customers who are getting back &quot;Signal illegal instruction&quot;
<BR>
errors when they try to run our software.  We're in the process of getting
<BR>
more details, but can anyone hazard a guess on why it would work in some
<BR>
Alpha boxen but not others, if they have the same version/distribution of
<BR>
Linux installed?
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
Eric
