Hello,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a odd problem with my AlphaStation 200.  I have a qlogicisp PCI
<BR>
card installed and the driver compiled as a module under RH6 with kernel
<BR>
2.2.11.  Attached to the controller is a StorageWorks shelf with 6 * 1 gig
<BR>
drives.  The odd thing is it sees all the drives but only starts 4 of them.
<BR>
It doesn't matter which 4, I've shuffled them around and the only common
<BR>
event is the number of available drives.  Is there something I need to
<BR>
change?  Is this deliberately restricted?  Newer version?
<BR>
<P>Thanks in Advance.
<BR>
<P>Damien.
<BR>
<P>P.S. My apologies if this has been answered before.  Other than via
<BR>
redhat.com are there better archive search engines?
<BR>
<P><PRE>
