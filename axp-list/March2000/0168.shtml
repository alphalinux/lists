<P>Intergraph produces CAD software.  On the hardware side, they used to
<BR>
produce their own unix worstations (based on the Clipper CPU, incomaptible
<BR>
with everything).  Years ago, they switched their hardware focus to the

NT market, and now sell NT workstations with some spiffed-up hardware.

Sounds like you have one of their high-end 3D cards (of course, I don't
<BR>
know how old it is...).  I don't think Intergraph gives out hardware specs
<BR>
though, so it's probably only usable under NT.
