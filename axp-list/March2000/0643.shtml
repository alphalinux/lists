<P>
<EM>&gt; Ughh..MILO....the easyist way around this is usually to make /boot a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seperate partition, or say that you don't support machines booting from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MILO (SRM only, unfortunatly that does leave out a few machines, UX, XL).
</EM><BR>
and my machine... for some reason SRM doesn't like my Matrox MII.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; So... if you want to see a mandrake distro coming out on the alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; please
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; join in on the &quot;cooker&quot; development. Subscribe to the mailing list and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; offer to test the distro on your machine.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; (And as an aside, any idea why Alpha architecture version wasn't out first?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Probably the lack of involvment of alpha-owners in the cooker project. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; beleive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm pretty much the only one (Could all alpha owners on the cooker list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; raise their hand?).
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think we need to be a little realistic here...I for one, did not know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the Mandrake cooker project, and I did not know we could help with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the porting effort (did anybody else know this?). If you don't tell 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people, don't be surprised when they don't help, right?
</EM><BR>
<P>Very true... This is one of the main problems I've been facing. The
<BR>
thing
<BR>
is, I'm not in the position to do the announcements. I've discussed this 
<BR>
over and over with the folks at mandrake. They have to decide if they
<BR>
want 
<BR>
to get people involved, if they have the resources to handle the
<BR>
bugfixes 
<BR>
/ comments etc. etc. and if their company actually _wants_ this product. 
<BR>
It's not up to me. I personally feel that I've already said too much in 
<BR>
my post to axp-list and cooker this morning, but I can't stand watching 
<BR>
a &quot;project&quot; inch onwards while there are many people that could help 
<BR>
alot.
<BR>
<P>I have the impression that Mandrake wants to release a bugless beta
<BR>
release, and until then, they're keeping things quiet. If that's their
<BR>
policy, that's fine. I respect that. But things won't move ahead as fast
<BR>
as they could. 
<BR>
<P>As ESR says... release early &amp; often...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you'd like we'd be more than happy to post a news item at alphalinux.org 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and send the info to the other mailing lists telling people it out there 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if they want to help....
</EM><BR>
I'm not employed by mandrake. Please contact mandrake directy if you
<BR>
want 
<BR>
official statements.
<BR>
<P>For the un-official stuff: I can confirm that the developers at mandrake
<BR>
are accepting patches for the alpha-port. They have demoed
<BR>
linux-mandrake
<BR>
on alpha machines during the Linux-Expo show in Paris. They have a few
<BR>
alpha machines on which they are developping...
<BR>
<P>So... I've already said too much...
