<EM>&gt; I've got a good boot disk w/ milo and that boots up fine. I've got a boot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disk with a generic kernel and a ramdisk. After trying many combinations of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boot lines of the form :
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boot fd0:vmlinux.gz root=/dev/hda load_ramdisk=1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   (or kernelname.gz)    (or sda*)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also tried many different kernels ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I would assume /dev/hda is your boot hard disk, not something
<BR>
you should be specifying on the boot command for the install.
<BR>
You tell the installer later that you want to install on
<BR>
that drive.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have my RH6.1 cd in the drive. The kernels always unzip (#UNZIP: this is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; zipped file) and then lot's of ###### ... while unzipping, and then the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; following:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>It would seem you're missing some information here. Are you
<BR>
positive there is no error message right after the unzip??
<BR>
<P>Also, try 3 floppies:
<BR>
<P>1. your current milo disk
<BR>
2. kernel image disk
<BR>
3. ramdisk image disk
<BR>
<P>Boot up to the milo prompt and after inserting
<BR>
the kernel disk, put:
<BR>
<P>boot fd0:vmlinux.gz root=/dev/fd0 load_ramdisk=1
<BR>
<P>If the kernel does boot up, it will ask you to insert
<BR>
the ramdisk floppy. If you don't get that, you must be
<BR>
getting some sort of error from the kernel. 
<BR>
<P>I've noticed sometimes floppies don't work even though
<BR>
the machine they were written on sees things fine. So, also
<BR>
try another floppy for your kernel image, preferably fresh.
