If the Terminal Server supports multisession then a key sequence can be set to switch between sessions on one serial line.  However, if the terminal does not support multisession then the display does not &quot;remember&quot; the screen and thus you will have to refresh the session to see what's there.  If they both support it then it acts like the virtual terminals on linux.  You just press the key sequence and you switch between them.  Some of the DEC terminals also have multiple serial inputs which allows you to connect the terminal to multiple lines and swap between them.  Most of the terminals also support an attached printer.  
<BR>
<P>This results in multiple connectors on some of the terminals.  On the higher end like the DEC VT520 you will have: com1 (DB25 female and DB25 male); com2 (MMJ female); com3 (MMJ female); LPT (DB25 female); ROM/RAM memory card connector.
<BR>
<P>You can have only 1 of the com1 connectors attached to a cable.  They provide two for convience.
<BR>
<P>MMJ - Modified Modular Jack is a DEC specification for 3 twisted pair (6 wires).  If the pin out is need it can be provided.

<EM>&gt; actually, i think the multisession capabilities are provided by the

<P>Mine has four &quot;com&quot; connectors. Two &quot;Com1&quot; serial conectors, and one 
<BR>
&quot;Com2&quot; and &quot;Com3&quot; connectors (RJ11?) From the little bits and peices of
<BR>
info I have been shown, it seems that both the terminal and the term
<BR>
server have to support multisession. Of course I may have read it wrong,
<BR>
but that's what it seems to say...
