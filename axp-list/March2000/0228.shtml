<P>
Awhile back I got a PC164 barebones system (board, 500MHz cpu and 400w ps)
<BR>
via ebay from Sysmerica Technologies (seen on Ebay as
<BR>
DaveD@sysmerica.com).
<BR>
<P>We had a small thread going back then here as a result, dealing with clock
<BR>
speeds, jumper settings for the clock multiplier, and different speed
<BR>
crystals.
<BR>
<P>My initial problem back then was correctable machine checks streaming
<BR>
across the screen after a few minutes, or it would just lock up.  I
<BR>
installed a new battery, tried all combinations of IRQ[0-3] jumper
<BR>
settings, but never was able to get it to work reliably.  That board had a
<BR>
50MHz crystal.
<BR>
<P>I just got a replacement board and cpu, and while I don't see any machine
<BR>
check errors, it does lock up after a bit (or the RH 6.x install dumps
<BR>
with a python error.  Installing FreeBSD 3.4-REL it locks up shortly after
<BR>
installing the ports tree trying to reset the scsi bus). The main thing
<BR>
I'm trying to deal with now is that even though it's a 500MHz cpu, it
<BR>
shows up in SRM as 366 regardless of the clock multiplier jumper setting
<BR>
(this new board has a 36.6MHz crystal).
<BR>
<P>I did flash it with the most recent version of SRM, but I've been
<BR>
wondering--if the motherboard jumper was set for a 366MHz cpu speed when
<BR>
I flashed in SRM, could that cause my problem?  I wouldn't think so, but I
<BR>
can't think of *any* logical reason why the thing would hold onto 366MHz
<BR>
regardless of how I set the jumper.
<BR>
<P>Is there something I'm missing?
<BR>
<P>Mike
