<P>hi,
<BR>
<P>start with the information on 
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.alphalinux.org/docs/jensen.shtml">http://www.alphalinux.org/docs/jensen.shtml</A>
<BR>
<P>but note that this page and the links you follow need some UPDATING.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've found quite a few different sets of instructions,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; each with slightly different requirements.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; farthest I've ever gotten is getting the kernel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; booted, but then it doesn't like the ramdisk I give it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (&quot;unable to mount root fs&quot;).
</EM><BR>
<P>a good deal of links will point to the digital ftp site, if you
<BR>
go there, however, you'll find this message:
<BR>
<P>&quot;A new install procedure for Jensens (et al.) is
<BR>
&nbsp;being developed at this time.  However, if you
<BR>
&nbsp;really need the files that were here, please
<BR>
&nbsp;go to /pub/Linux-Alpha/ARCHIVES/JENSEN_INSTALL.&quot;
<BR>
<P>(can anyone comment on the status of this new procedure btw?)
<BR>
<P>so remember to modify all the links you find to digital's ftp
<BR>
site with this path.
<BR>
<P>re-write your images from fresh downloads, since the checksums
<BR>
are there to protect you from really screwing up your bios rewrite.
<BR>
<P>from my personal experience, I was not able to get redhat 6.0
<BR>
to work from the kernel I got from digital's ftp site.  just
<BR>
too old.  but I was able to get it to install and then boot single 
<BR>
user without locking up on boot (add INIT=/bin/sh to the boot 
<BR>
command options) from there I was able to transfer files that I had 
<BR>
downloaded from Henry van der Vegt's site at:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://nic.ced.tudelft.nl/~henry/jensen/redhat/6.1.92/">http://nic.ced.tudelft.nl/~henry/jensen/redhat/6.1.92/</A>
<BR>
<P>(thanks henry, btw) and install them as my boot kernel, after 
<BR>
some long hours I managed to get a whole new working /boot
<BR>
area going.
<BR>
<P>note that most of my problems with the existing jensen documentation
<BR>
was that the boot flags were somewhat different on my axp150 (the
<BR>
initial srm boot phase), and the fact that digitals' jensen kernel 
<BR>
froze my system booting redhat 6.0.  reading the bootparam man page 
<BR>
helped alot (looks like you need a root=/dev/sda2 argument or something 
<BR>
similar on your boot commandline).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm current following these instructions:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.khubla.com/jensen.html">http://www.khubla.com/jensen.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why those?  Because they supply some (supposedly)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recent kernel/ramdisk files.  However, even these do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not work.  After I copy the kernel to the HD and try
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to boot with it I get &quot;?02 KSP INVAL&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is this firmware related?  I can't figure out how to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tell what firmware it's running now AND when I try to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; install 1.7 (blowing away the unknown existing ver) I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get a checksum error.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Help!!
