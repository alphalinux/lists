<EM>&gt; My AS200 4/233 was actually my introduction to Red Hat.
</EM><BR>
[rant on]
<BR>
Same here.  Contrary to what modern spinmasters might tell you,
<BR>
early versions of RedHat were really, really terrible. 
<BR>
I have copies of the mothers day 1.0, 1.1 and 2.1 releases (and
<BR>
some stuff from BOGUS) if anyone wants to make themselves violently
<BR>
ill.  They were buggier than a house full of termites, and dists like 
<BR>
slack or yggdrasil easily put them to shame.

<EM>&gt; &gt; &lt;non-threatening-discussion-provoking-question&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If Alpha Linux is more finicky/troublesome than Linux Intel why are some of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you using it?
</EM><BR>
<P>Depends on what you consider difficult to maintain.  Coming into
<BR>
the Alpha world from experience with traditional Un*x and 
<BR>
using early Linux, AlphaLinux was not bad at all.  
<BR>
That may come across conceited, but I don't want it to..
<BR>
<P>For someone coming straight from a Win/Mac background, 
<BR>
AlphaLinux must seem like a Grand Challenge problem.  
<BR>
I came out of the Ultrix/SunOS/BSD days, coding 
<BR>
all sorts of convoluted low-level stuff, and tinkering with
<BR>
things like RSX-11.  The Alpha had some quirks which
<BR>
did not want to go away (not being able to use a PCI ethernet
<BR>
&nbsp;card in the 64-bit slots of my DPWS for example), but 
<BR>
I adapted. 
<BR>
<P>If you want a quick and dirty 'why I use AlphaLinux', here it is.
<BR>
I need to remind you that these are all imho:
<BR>
<P>1&gt; &quot;Its the economy, stupid&quot;.  I grew up with a strong sense of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;making the most out of any investment.  If my Alpha doesn't
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do personal requirement foo, I do my best to code foo or 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work with those people who are.  Giving up on the platform and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selling all my Alphas does not compute. 
<BR>
2&gt; All operating systems suck, and the shortcomings of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AlphaLinux are compensated in other ways.  I'm sitting
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here listening to mp3's, processing a rather large data file,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and throwing 2GB tarfiles between my two systems.  And
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are still responsive.  I imagine most x86 boxes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would be sucking floor tile trying to do the same. 
<BR>
3&gt; Its the mystique.  DEC made an early impression on me with 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vaxes and pdp-11's, what can I say. 
<BR>
<P>In summary, don't take all of this too seriously ;-)
<BR>
Ultimately the decision of what platform to buy and use
<BR>
at home comes down to you.
<BR>
