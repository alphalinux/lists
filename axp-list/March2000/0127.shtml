<P>
(totally off topic)
<BR>
<P>but, speaking of dos partition tables:
<BR>
can anyone point me to information or utilities to attempt to recover info
<BR>
from a dos disk with a damaged partition table?
<BR>
better yet:
<BR>
methods to utilize an image of the _disk_ in a file?
<BR>
(not an image of the partition; if i had that i wouldnt be asking...)
<BR>
<P>[i happen to have an &quot;identically configured&quot; disk and its image as well,
<BR>
and using a binary editor can 'see' the 'problem', but even if i were to
<BR>
overwrite the 'broken' image with the info from the intact one i would
<BR>
still have an image of a disk... id like to avoid having to write out the 
<BR>
image to a device before trying to read it...]
<BR>
<P>please feel free to remove the list from the reply...
<BR>
<P>any pointers much appreciated.
