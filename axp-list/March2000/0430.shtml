<EM>&gt; &gt; BTW, is the sparse mapping somewhat related to the actual PCI-id on the

<EM>&gt; &gt; that portion corresponding to the card. The PCI information is obtained

<EM>&gt; Egbert changed that area (lnx_video.c memory mapping), I think for some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasons associated with multi-head, to map the *entire* PCI DENSE and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (not quite all of) SPARSE, from the earlier, only-what-is-needed method.

<P>Please don't do this.  Yes, I can understand wanting to not have
<BR>
to associate re-mapped regions with particular cards or whatever,
<BR>
but there is a better way. 
<BR>
<P>Alpha userland has a 44-bit virtual address space to play with.
<BR>
Let's use it.  Choose some otherwise unused area of the vm space.
<BR>
I suggest beginning at 0x300_0000_0000.  Reserve the first 16G
<BR>
beginning there for sparse mappings on hose 0, reserve the next
<BR>
4G for dense mappings on hose 0.  Begin the mappings for hose 1
<BR>
at offset 32G, and so on.
<BR>
<P>I say &quot;reserve&quot;, but that's something that only happens in your
<BR>
mind.  There is, unfortunately, no unix syscall to actually do
<BR>
any reservation.  However, you can safely know that most memory
<BR>
will be mapped about 0x200_0000_0000, and that someone would 
<BR>
have to go out of their way to map something at 0x300_0000_0000.
<BR>
Given that the X server is in control of itself and is not a
<BR>
library, we can easily make the assumption that our &quot;reserved&quot;
<BR>
region will not be fiddled with.
<BR>
<P>That said, it's easy enough to use MAP_FIXED to mmap the portions
<BR>
of the I/O region that are actually needed, and to position the
<BR>
portions _as if_ the entire region were mapped.
