<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hallo !
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; We are attempting to install RH 6.1 from the official RH CD-ROM. The install
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; is launched from IDE-CDROM vi SRM (no problems), the two (sym and qlogic)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; SCSI boards are detected and the installation programm starts. Unfortunately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; we cannot find a way to get the SCSI disks to be recognized by the installer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Using &quot;expert text&quot; we are prompted for a driver disks (where is such a disk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; available ?) and then we can choose to include modules for network and scsi.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; The network list includes several cards but the scsi list remains empty.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; How do we get the SCSI modules to be included ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; We searched for devices, but /dev was virtually empty (only a few entries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; concering ports like ttyx and console). I checked wether an updated ramdisk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; exists but I didn't find one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If this is a Miata, (pws433au, etc.) The &quot;Qlogic ISP&quot; controller in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; motherboard doesn't work with the current drivers. Don't connect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; anything to it. Forget it's there. I don't know if anybody is working on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a fix or not.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am not sure where the disks are exactly at, but while the controllers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are found during boot none of the disks can be seen by the installer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I have an XP1000 running RH6.0 without problems.
<BR>
I don't recall any problems with the install but
<BR>
it has been a while. First, you are running things
<BR>
from SRM as your console? SRM should show the disks
<BR>
on the Qlogic without trouble. AlphaBios is not an
<BR>
option on XP1000.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; As for the &quot;missing&quot; modules in the installer, I thought that was an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; error myself- until I realized that Alpha does not support the initrd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; image that the intel platform does. All the supported scsi modules are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; already compiled into the Alpha kernel. To install with an &quot;unsupported&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; scsi adapter, I assume you would need to compile a new kernel that could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be put on a floppy with the correct scsi module already compiled in. Of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; course this means comiling on another Alpha (chicken and egg problem).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Both controller should be supported according to the manual. We do have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; several alphas, so compiling would not be a problem. Is it possible to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simply mount the boot image via loopback and copy a new kernel in ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I remember something abour romfs. Is this documented somewhere ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>The boot disk is just an ext2 fs on a floppy. Mount it
<BR>
as any other ext2 fs. The ramdisk is a romfs. 
<BR>
<P>There is an RPM that allows you to do romfs images.
<BR>
Once you install it, hopefully &quot;man mkromfs&quot; will tell you
<BR>
more. (or whatever it's called)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Once you install from this custom boot floppy, you would need to start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the system once with it and recompile again on the target machine again
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with the correct scsi adapter selected.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No problem once something is on the machine. Thanks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is there some docu on XP1000 installation of RH 6.x ? We just tried 6.0,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but it failed exactly at the same spot. On API I found only referrences
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regarding RH 5.2.
</EM><BR>
<P>Check Compaq's site.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;          Helge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BTW. Does someone know where the /dev-entries are,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      so I could mount somthing manually ?
</EM><BR>
<P>Any /dev entries for disks are in /tmp during the install.
<BR>
They are created/deleted on the fly though so at any given
<BR>
point, they may not exist unless the installer needs them.
