Hello all
<BR>
<P><P>I have found limited success in my all-important quest to 
<BR>
play glquake on my Alpha and I am looking for any feedback 
<BR>
from interested parties.  Here is the current status.
<BR>
<P>My machine:  164LX/533MHz, Matrox Millenium, running RH6.1. 
<BR>
Mesa3.0 installed.
<BR>
<P>I downloaded the recent quakeforge souces and compiled all 
<BR>
targets.  Compilation went smooth.  Fired up glquake and was
<BR>
surprised to see a very pretty menu screen thanks to Mesa.  
<BR>
Unfortunately sound was extremely choppy so I turned that off.  
<BR>
I then ran a couple of the demos - damn was it slow, but what 
<BR>
do you expect without hardware acceleration.  I then tried to 
<BR>
fire up a single player game and got a core dump (not sure 
<BR>
what the problem is here).  
<BR>
<P>Conclusions/questions:  Glquake looks to be a reality soon on 
<BR>
Alpha.  There are possibly some issues but I'm not going to 
<BR>
look into them further until I have some sort of hardware 
<BR>
acceleration.  So my biggest question is whether anyone is 
<BR>
currently using hardware accelerated Mesa on Alpha and what 
<BR>
cards are you using.  
<BR>
<P>I hope to get in touch with whomever is updating the games 
<BR>
section of Alphalinux.org soon, if there is adequate interest, 
<BR>
so people can keep track of the current status of glquake on 
<BR>
Alpha.  The biggest piece of the the puzzle which is currently 
<BR>
missing is the question of 3d hardware on Alpha so I would 
<BR>
really appreciate anyone with experience here to email me.
<BR>
<P><P>Cheers
<BR>
<P>-Eric Christy
