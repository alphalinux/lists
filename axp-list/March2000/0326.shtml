<P>
OK, so one fundamental misunderstanding was that a $500 chip estimate got
<BR>
translated into a $500 motherboard+chip estimate.  That's a pretty big
<BR>
difference since it ignores the cost of nine 4 ns SRAMs (assuming a 4 MB
<BR>
cache), 7 high pin count custom ASICs, the integrated controllers for audio,
<BR>
Ethernet, &amp; UW SCSI, etc, etc.
<BR>
<P>Of course, the key thing missing in your trusted friend's cost estimate is
<BR>
quantity.  There's no fab in the world that would quote without an
<BR>
associated quantity, because that determines how they amortize their fixed
<BR>
costs (the $1B+ capital investment in the fab, design costs, etc).
<BR>
<P>If anyone wants to look at pure marginal manufacturing cost without respect
<BR>
to any of these real world economics, you can use the figures published by
<BR>
MicroDesign Resources, the publishers of Microprocessor Report.  They
<BR>
consider nothing but die size, process, and their guess as to yields.  More
<BR>
importantly, they publish these figures in their newsletter and are willing
<BR>
to have them attributed to them (i.e. they're not anonymous).
<BR>
<P>Here are some of MDR's estimates for a few of the more popular
<BR>
microprocessors:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21264A		$160
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PIII Xeon	$40
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Athlon		$105 (inc. 512KB L2 cache)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power3		$320
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G4		$35
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R12K		$140
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PA8500		$330
<BR>
<P>As you can see, your friend's estimate is three times what the &quot;pros&quot;
<BR>
estimate.  Of course these numbers are mostly of academic interest, because
<BR>
in the real world you DO have to amortize all your fixed costs and provide a
<BR>
return to the investors who put up the billions of dollars of capital to
<BR>
build your fabs and hire your top flight engineers.
<BR>
<P>You were to look purely at the manufacturing cost, without considering any
<BR>
of the other costs, one would think that $100 Coppermines or $250 Athlons
<BR>
would be a no brainer - after all, that's 2.5X markup which ought to be
<BR>
plenty for any reasonable company.  How soon do folks think we'll see &lt;$100
<BR>
Pentium IIIs?
<BR>
<P>Now, I'm hardly one to be defending Compaq, but there are plenty of things
<BR>
that they can be blamed for without inventing new ones.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Gentlemen,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Regarding this thread about fab costs. The figures for the cost of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manufacture came from me in a private conversation between Dan and Myself.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The actual figures told to me by a trusted friend that is in the &quot;computer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; business&quot; but works outside of Compaq/API. The costs for the chips was a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quote from a silcon fab that given X transitors, RISC design, and Y
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complexity that this is how much it would cost. Around $500. The board not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; included. That is fact. Whether that is the &quot;actual&quot; fab cost of an Alpha?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can only speculate. I am very sorry for the disruption this has caused
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the Alphalinux community and in the future I will make sure that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; private information does not end up on this list or any other list ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; again.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Best Regards,
</EM><BR>
