<EM>&gt; Well, but this was not my intention. The main intention was that we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should be using Byte/Word access on machines which support it.
</EM><BR>
<P>At the time that PYXIS-based machines were first supported, there was no
<BR>
need to force byte/word use; in fact, it was difficult, as the assembler
<BR>
didn't even support the byte/word instructions, IIRC. So it was easiest
<BR>
to just continue using SPARSE. It wasn't until the appearance of the EV6
<BR>
machines that it became necessary to support the byte/word stuff, and I
<BR>
guess we never got around to considering changing the PYXIS support to
<BR>
use them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Unfortunately the information given by libc via _bus_base is misleading,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since on a PYXIS _bus_base points to the dense memory area (which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; completely useless) and not to the beginning of the byte/word I/O area,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as it should be.
</EM><BR>
<P>Completely useless for byte/word access, yes, but the primary use of
<BR>
the _bus_base area is as *memory*, not registers (whose size often
<BR>
require byte/word access for correct operation). And the code to
<BR>
access framebuffer memory is strictly controlled to perform (as much
<BR>
as possible :-) aligned 32- or 64-bit access to that area
<BR>
<P>Only with the more modern cards have memory-mapped registers (and thus
<BR>
SPARSE access) become a requirement - all earlier cards used
<BR>
inb/outb/etc to access the legacy VGA register addresses. IIRC, Matrox
<BR>
Millennium I was the reason the SPARSE stuff had to go in, and even
<BR>
more, it required PCI Config Space access as well, which necessitated
<BR>
the addition of those syscalls on Alpha.
<BR>
<P>But yes, in the next incarnation of _bus_base support code, we will
<BR>
make PYXIS utilize the BWIO space.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Hmm, the above fix: does it work on all older machines ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ie can they all mmap() this area ? If so, we can just go ahead and use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your patch,
</EM><BR>
<P>It should, though (as I mentioned before) it is quite wasteful of system
<BR>
resources, and it may be overkill for the older boxes (EV4 and EV45).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; if not, well, than I fear we have to hardcode the memory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regions for every single machine.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not a very atttractive option.
