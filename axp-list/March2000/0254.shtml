<P>
Is there a known problem with the tulip ethernet driver
<BR>
for axp/PC164?  (running RedHat 6.1)
<BR>
_____________________________________
<BR>
<P>I've been testing two different PC164 systems
<BR>
for several days now,
<BR>
with and without PCI NetGear Tulip ethernet
<BR>
cards installed.   After about six different cycles
<BR>
of removing and then reinstalling ethernet cards,
<BR>
these systems have never crashed
<BR>
(frozen) when there is no tulip card in the system,
<BR>
but they have always crashed within 30 minutes
<BR>
when tulip cards are installed.  (I run a mozilla make
<BR>
job and turn on a busy screensaver.)
<BR>
<P>I've tried two different tulips, both NetGear,
<BR>
one with a genuine Digital tulip chip, and the other
<BR>
with a NetGear chip.  Both have frozen these systems.
<BR>
An inspection of the driver automatically configured
<BR>
at boot time using Linuxconf shows the name &quot;old-tulip&quot;.
<BR>
A 3Com509 has also been installed and the system
<BR>
has not frozen when this card is running.
<BR>
<P>Prior to one of my upgrades from RedHat 5.2,
<BR>
the first system had been running fine using NetGear
<BR>
tulip cards.  After the system started freezing,
<BR>
I checked just about everything, going so far
<BR>
as to purchace three more pc164 boards+cpus.
<BR>
I'm just now getting around to actually pulling
<BR>
the ethernet card.
