<EM>&gt; All this may be true, but I would prefer it if all Linux implementations

<EM>&gt; use the same /boot/vmlinuz convention.

<P>The problem is that it's not just up to aboot, SRM would also have to know
<BR>
about this, so you'd have to convince Q that's it's in their best
<BR>
interest to add this stuff to SRM. However, this makes more difficult for
<BR>
the disributions right? At the moment if they see SRM they are safe to
<BR>
setup BSD and go on, if they see MILO in the serial number string then
<BR>
they need to use PC partitions.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From my personal view, the last thing we need right now is to add
</EM><BR>
something else that is going to make use/installation of Alpha any more
<BR>
difficult.
