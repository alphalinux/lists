The good folks at Red Hat support services
<BR>
(I have a boxed set) did not appear to be aware
<BR>
of this problem.   I was calling them on a regular
<BR>
basis until my support expired.  They thought I
<BR>
had a bad motherboard/cpu, and so did I...
<BR>
I bought a &quot;new&quot; set.
<BR>
<P>There is no update from RedHat to fix this problem.
<BR>
This seems like a fairly important problem to solve,
<BR>
since it makes a PC164 less stable than an NT box.

<P>Are you saying that older Netgear cards (the ones with Digital chips)

cannot use the new tulip driver?
<BR>
My systems were freezing with both old and new Netgear cards.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;From what I have seen, the boxed set RedHat Kernel, 2.2.13,
</EM><BR>
uses only the old_tulip (v0.89h) driver.

<EM>&gt; There is now identified a long standing problem with a tulip driver (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other, like eepro100, for example) on all platforms.  A circular list of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; skbufs may get empty why it should not be and this results in an attempt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by your kernel to dereference the address 0 which translates to crash.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For some reasons you are seem more likely to see that condition with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; current 2.2 kernels but you need a pretty heavy net traffic for that.
</EM><BR>
<P>These systems freeze up with no network traffic, no wire connected.
<BR>
All you need is the tulip card installed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Tulip fixes were included in 2.2.14; eepro100 will show up in 2.2.15.
</EM><BR>
<P>I see that 2.2.13 includes a new tulip driver (tulip.c:v0.91g-ppc 7/16/99),
<BR>
<P>the same one included in 2.2.14.
<BR>
Where are the Tulip fixes included?  In the hardware detection?
