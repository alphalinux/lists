<EM>&gt; I'd been having some odd lockups of my PC164LX machines... they'd be

<EM>&gt; fine, and then they'd be pingable but you can't log in, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; console is unresponsive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I got on one right before it crashed and netstat -to showed the timers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weren't changing. Then later I got on aother right before it crashed,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and realized that &quot;date&quot; wasn't changing. Then I made a script which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ran date on each machine every 10 seconds. Machines that crash
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; definitely have stopped clocks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Given that I saw this under 2.0.35 and 2.2.5-16 (rh 6.0's kernel), I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't think it's a kernel bug. The only hardware oddity that I know of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is that when you reboot these guys, the cmos date is always wrong. I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to replace all the batteries... could that possibly cause this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; symptom?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I haven't had this much fun with clocks since I realized that flipping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the front-panel switch on a PDP-11 that turns off the clock breaks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Kermit, and little else.

<P><EM>&gt;Well, my 164LX machines have been locking up, too.  It happend again 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;yesterday on my desktop machine.  I was on a VC when it locked up.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;could still switch consoles, but couldn't type anything.  The machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was still pingable, but I couldn't log in remotely.  When I switched to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;VC #7 (where X was running) I couldn't change back.  This was with kernel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;2.2.12pre4.  I have since upgraded to 2.2.12pre14 and turned on the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;magic SysReq keys.   It hasn't locked up yet...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;BTW, I believe that this machine's battery is ok.  I don't know if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;clock stopped or not when it hung. 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Well, finally there seems to be somebody with the same problem then I have
<BR>
for more than a year: System clock stops, no response to keyboard anymore.
<BR>
Login sometimes still works for a while, and a halt sometimes prevents to
<BR>
mess up the harddrive. Reboot from another machine never worked in my
<BR>
case.
<BR>
<P>I called Digital and they came and changed the mainboard, because they 
<BR>
expected a hardware problem. But it did not help. 
<BR>
<P>I just figured out that something is wrong with my cron jobs. About every
<BR>
hour root gets an email from the system:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From root  Sat Oct  2 16:01:01 1999
</EM><BR>
Date: Sat, 2 Oct 1999 16:01:01 +0200

<P><P>Strange enough, most of the time my system crashed exactely at this
<BR>
time!!! So usually the times stoped one minute after the hour! 
<BR>
<P>So is it possible that there is a connection between the cronjob and
<BR>
the halt of the system clock???
<BR>
<P>I really hope that there is a solution soon for this problem. Today I
<BR>
had to crashes alreday.
<BR>
<P>P.S.: I'm running RH 5.2, but had the problem already with 5.0.
