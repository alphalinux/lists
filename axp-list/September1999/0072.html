<EM>&gt; It appears that Suyudi at least successfully booted a Sable into Linux even

<EM>&gt; this hardware into RH6.0.  We are going nuts here because we have a 2100

<EM>&gt; 5/300 that can boot neither 6.0 nor 5.2 and we're not sure what to do about

Don't know if relevant or not, FYI:
<BR>
<P>The machine that I have, AlphaServer 2100 5/250 i believe it's sable-g. I dl
<BR>
the boot &amp; ramdisk image kernel version 2.2.10. Installation went successfully
<BR>
without any problem. I also tried 5.2 and debian 2.0 without any problem either.
<BR>
<P>I just got Matrox Millenium from a friend of mine and hopefully X will work by
<BR>
the end of this week. I tried with Diamond Stealth 64 SDRAM, Cirrus logic, and
<BR>
Trident all did not work. (actually the cirrus and trident wasn't recognized
<BR>
by SRM thus the X somehow won't run) The Diamond (S3) runs fine although
<BR>
the somw colors did not show up and mouse cursor (sw) did not refreshed correctly.
<BR>
<P>I also have alphaserver 2000 5/250 that I would like to install linux on it
<BR>
as soon as i'm done with this one.
