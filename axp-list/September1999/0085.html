<P>
There was a note recently about problems getting the Tru64 version of
<BR>
Mathematica to run on Alpha Linux, despite the use of the libraries (looked
<BR>
like an unsupported ioctl() call perhaps) which made me wonder how many
<BR>
different applications folks have tried to do this with.
<BR>
<P>I'd be interested in hearing from anyone who's run a commercial Tru64
<BR>
application on Alpha Linux successfully.  Send me mail with the name of the
<BR>
app and the versions and I'll summarize for the list.  Conversely, if you've
<BR>
tried an application unsuccessfully, I'd be interested in hearing about that
<BR>
as well.
<BR>
<P>Send you mail to tom.morris@alpha-processor.com so we don't bog down the
<BR>
entire list.
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
Tom
