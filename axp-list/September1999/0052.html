<P>&quot;I don't want no pickles, I don't want no honey,

<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Anyone else able to (or *not* able to) boot a 2100 into any 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RedHat flavor?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hmm.. It is possible to get a sable running with any linux 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; flavour, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only question is how long it takes you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You didn't tell us at all what you tried to get it booted, no error
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; messages, not how far you got, whether the machine hung, ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So it's really hard to help you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sorry.
</EM><BR>

<P>Your points are valid.  I will get some details compiled and send these off.
<BR>
Mainly I was trying to see if indeed one could accomplish this on a 2100.
<BR>
The boot process &quot;hung&quot; after a few minutes booting from a RH6.0 CD.  As to
<BR>
the exact place of the hang I'm not sure but will provide this so we can see
<BR>
if someone knows what to do.
<BR>
<P>Greg.
