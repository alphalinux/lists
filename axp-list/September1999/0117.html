Hi all,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I managed to install RH60 on my AlphaPC 164LX with the helps
<BR>
kindly provided in replies to my earlier posts.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I downloaded the RH60 from sunsite.unc.edu and copied it to 8mm tape,
<BR>
and so used Hard drive installation. In the last two days, I was trying
<BR>
to put RH60 on a CDROM. What troubles me is that the file names are
<BR>
extremely long in these RH Linux. On a Mac, Adaptec Toast can admit only
<BR>
less-than-40-character file name with ISO9660 format and Joliet naming.
<BR>
So it's not long enough. On a PC with HP CDwriter Plus and Adaptec Easy
<BR>
CD Creator, I used Joliet file format which admits file name of 64-characters,
<BR>
however, I could not install RH60 from it directly. I tried to copy
<BR>
the CDROM to hard drive and see what's going on. Then there are Input/output
<BR>
errors while copying from the CDROM to the hard drive.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason that I am playing with this CDROM matter is that
<BR>
I'd like to install RH60 on my laptop which does not have enough space
<BR>
and I like to install RH60 from a CDROM. I have been using Slackware Linux
<BR>
for my Intel PCs for a long time and I like it very much. Installing
<BR>
this RH stuff is forced on me just because of one Alpha I got and I am not a 
<BR>
RH person.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone knows how to make this cdrom, please advice. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
Thanks,
<BR>
<P>Sun
