Hi All,
<BR>
<P>After upgraded to Red Hat 6.0, under some conditions files are created
<BR>
with only owner read-write permissions. When new messages are added with
<BR>
the CGI bulletin boards, files are created with only owner read
<BR>
permissions, so the messages are added, but are not readable by others.
<BR>
The CGI program is the same as before. Only the system was upgraded.
<BR>
<P>I don't think that the apache web server (v 1.3.6) is anything to do with
<BR>
this. A machine where the apache server (with the same version and the
<BR>
same configuration) running on Red Hat 5.2. creates files with read
<BR>
permission to other by the program.
<BR>
<P>I noticed this similar behavior change when I created user's accounts with
<BR>
Red Hat 6.0. User's home directories were created with only owner rwx
<BR>
permission. I checked /etc/profile file. Umask is 022 and 002 - when I
<BR>
created a file using vi, touch, or pico, it did get read permissions for
<BR>
group and other.
<BR>
<P>Does anyone tell me where I should look to change this behavior so that
<BR>
CGI programming creates files with read permissions for group and other?
<BR>
<P>Thanks.
<BR>
