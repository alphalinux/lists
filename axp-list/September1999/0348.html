<P><EM>&gt; Looking for a new SCSI card for my 164sx 533MHz system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; currently running 2 adaptecs with multiple hard drives on them... (from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which I've heard and seen is a bad thing on alpha linux)
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me about it! I am limping along with an AHA-2940 in my XLT,
<BR>
with 6 (3x2GB+3x4GB) drives on it. Accessing four or more drives at once
<BR>
is assured to get one a SCSI timeout, which means raid is pretty much out.
<BR>
I had concluded that maybe it was just SCSI limitations that I was
<BR>
pushing, but maybe also the card quality as well? The chain is within
<BR>
length specs, and runs only at fast speeds, even though two of the 4GB
<BR>
drives are ultras. I have a BT-930 I would love to use... but that is
<BR>
another story (no alpha support for them yet). Also, the onboard NCR is
<BR>
already busy with a 2GB system disk, three CD drives, a tape drive, and a
<BR>
CD-R. :)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; any ideas for good SCSI cards that don't time out under high load? and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; may alos be compatible with Digital UNIX?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't need Tru64 compat, just stablity with Linux. From the
<BR>
other recommendations made, it looks like a Tekram DC-390 (w/53C875
<BR>
chipset) would be the best, and about $70/each. Am I correct in this? I
<BR>
plan to use two of them, one for four disks and one for three disks. And
<BR>
yes, I need the ones with 50pin connectors, the cables to my storage array
<BR>
are HD50, and I don't want to pay for adapters! I have heard that Tekram
<BR>
SCSI cards work well with Linux/Alpha, does this include this card
<BR>
(DC-390)? Thanks.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; -gotta love free power in dorm rooms... computers haven't been turned off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for 2 weeks now... all 3 of em
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, three weeks for me, and I have eight computers running!
<BR>
Approximately 750 watts of power drain. :) Of course, I do have a BF-UPS
<BR>
(think BFG...) for when they decide to play with the breaker box
<BR>
(maintance or others).
