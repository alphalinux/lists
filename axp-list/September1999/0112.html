Hi,
<BR>
<P>You need to use ISO9660 with RockRidge support.  NOT joilet.  Joilet is a windows format.  Rock Ridge is a unix format.
<BR>
<P>The problem is most cheap PC burning software can only do the joilet extension.
<BR>

Hi all,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I managed to install RH60 on my AlphaPC 164LX with the helps kindly provided in replies to my earlier posts.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I downloaded the RH60 from sunsite.unc.edu and copied it to 8mm tape, and so used Hard drive installation. In the last two days, I was trying to put RH60 on a CDROM. What troubles me is that the file names are extremely long in these RH Linux. On a Mac, Adaptec Toast can admit only less-than-40-character file name with ISO9660 format and Joliet naming.
<BR>
So it's not long enough. On a PC with HP CDwriter Plus and Adaptec Easy CD Creator, I used Joliet file format which admits file name of 64-characters, however, I could not install RH60 from it directly. I tried to copy the CDROM to hard drive and see what's going on. Then there are Input/output errors while copying from the CDROM to the hard drive.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason that I am playing with this CDROM matter is that I'd like to install RH60 on my laptop which does not have enough space and I like to install RH60 from a CDROM. I have been using Slackware Linux for my Intel PCs for a long time and I like it very much. Installing this RH stuff is forced on me just because of one Alpha I got and I am not a RH person.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone knows how to make this cdrom, please advice. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
Thanks,
<BR>
<P>Sun
