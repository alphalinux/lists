I currently own 3 DEC Alpha Multias that are running RH6.0.  One of them used to
<BR>
be used as a transparent firewall/proxy server, but with the conversion of our
<BR>
USWest DSL account from Bridging to PPP mode that box no longer has any
<BR>
purpose.  Something that occured to me that I would like to do is to use these
<BR>
as a combination Applications server/network storage systems.  I am trying to
<BR>
migrate the home network away from M$ apps (eg Microsoft Office) and begin using
<BR>
such products as StarOffice (now owned by Sun) or Applixware.  The other boxes
<BR>
on the network run WindowsNT 4.0sp5 on Intel PII or PII Xeon processors.  Is
<BR>
there a way to do this and if so what packages are needed/recommended to pull
<BR>
this off.  I only have a basic understanding of Linux (eg I can get around and I
<BR>
have recompiled kernels, but I'm no expert/guru).  Thanks for your time and
<BR>
suggestions.
