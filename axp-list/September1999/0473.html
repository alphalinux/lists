<P>
I've been working with 2.2.13pre14 on an SMP machine and came across
<BR>
something rather strange. If I compile the kernel with Enhanced Real Time
<BR>
clock support (config_rtc) then it 'seems' like nothing ever gets
<BR>
scheduled on the 2nd cpu. I say 'seems' because I'm looking at tools like
<BR>
top (which never shows &gt;50% cpu util) and gtop (which never shows work on
<BR>
the 2nd cpu). Howver both CPUs are detected at boot and /proc/cpuinfo
<BR>
reports 
<BR>
<P>'CPUs probed 2 active 2 map 0x3 IPIs 40131'
<BR>
<P>/proc/interupts shows +rtc interupts for the 2nd CPU
<BR>
<P>Now if I disable the RTC then everything looks fine.
<BR>
<P><P>So, is this a kernel problem or are the userland tools failing? The only
<BR>
other way I could thing of testing this would be to run some sort of
<BR>
benchmark, get the time it took to run, then run it twice (both at the
<BR>
same time that is) and see if the second time is 2x the original (or greater).
<BR>
That should in theory tell me if the 2nd CPU is being used.
<BR>
<P>Anybody have any ideas on this? It's seems a little strange, especaially
<BR>
when config_rtc says 
<BR>
<P>&quot;If you run Linux on a multiprocessor machine and said Y to
<BR>
&quot;Symmetric Multi Processing&quot; above, you should say Y here to read
<BR>
and set the RTC clock in an SMP compatible fashion.&quot;
