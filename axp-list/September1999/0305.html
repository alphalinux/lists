<P>
I installed a boot image from floppy to the beginning of
<BR>
the hard drive. The drive was partitioned BSD style with
<BR>
minlabel. I used copyboot to install the floppy image onto
<BR>
device /dev/sda (beginning of disk). It claimed it was
<BR>
successful (thus it's not a bad floppy or disk). The failure
<BR>
I get is when I try to boot this image from SRM. To get to
<BR>
aboot I try:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; boot -fl i dka000
</EM><BR>
<P>Some startup messages, and then the aboot prompt:
<BR>
<P><EM>aboot&gt; 0/a root=/dev/fd0 load_ramdisk=1
</EM><BR>
<P>Now this is *supposed* to load the image on /dev/sda and
<BR>
prompt for the RH ramdisk. I get no disk activity that I
<BR>
can hear/see and after a few seconds...
<BR>
<P>Unrecognized object file format ...
<BR>
dummy_bread failed
<BR>
<P>unzip: failure
<BR>
<P>I can't even get to the ramdisk prompt. :-(
<BR>
<P>Thanks for any help,
<BR>
<P>Michael

<EM>&gt; I did all of what you said, 20 times over and several
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; permutations of it. I followed Jim Paradis instructions to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the letter, as well as the instructions on www.alphalinux.org.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I also had about 5 different people so far offer methods that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have worked for them. There is nothing wrong with my hardware.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've had NT running on the machine, and all drives, etc. have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been tested under Alpha/Linux on other Alpha boxes. I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; written the boot sector of the disk as instructed including
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the aboot/kernel combo at a 2 block offset. I have upgraded to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; firmware 1.7. I fail at the point when I try to boot off the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hard drive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aboot&gt; 0/a root=/dev/fd0 load_ramdisk=1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is verbatim what it says on www.alphalinux.org.

<P>Might help if you tell me what your failure is. I don't
<BR>
recall if you posted it previously. Does it load the
<BR>
kernel at all from your HD? Still have to separate whether
<BR>
you have the disk bootable from whether the kernel just
<BR>
doesn't work on your system. Keep in mind the latest RH6.0
<BR>
install requires a kernel with romfs support and if you're
<BR>
using an older kernel, like from instructions like these
<BR>
for the Jensen, it probably won't work.
