<P>
This goes back to a post that Suyudi Koeswanto posted in early August.  This
<BR>
is not so much a reply to that but the subject matter, namely AlphaServer
<BR>
2100 5/x is much on my mind.
<BR>
<P>It appears that Suyudi at least successfully booted a Sable into Linux even
<BR>
if X wasn't set up.  I would like to know if others have successfully booted
<BR>
this hardware into RH6.0.  We are going nuts here because we have a 2100
<BR>
5/300 that can boot neither 6.0 nor 5.2 and we're not sure what to do about
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P>Anyone else able to (or *not* able to) boot a 2100 into any RedHat flavor?

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have AlphaServer 2100 5/250 with cirrus GD5430.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I just installed RHL6.0 and everything is setup but the X.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And since I cannot get it to work with X, today I thought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I want to try something different, which is changing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; video card. I did open the box, took off the video card..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; replace it, and then i also took off the CPU board and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memory board just for curiosity. Then i put back everything,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and now.. it won't run anymore. (I put back everything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the place where they were before)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Infact, it won't even do anything when I push the power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; button. It seems like the power supply had died, but if I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; check the back, the power supply AC light is ON!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But again, if I press the power on button, nothing happened.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not even a FAN or HD spinning.. nothing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I hope I did not damage the machine. Hey, any ideas?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm really desperate now.. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I finally got an alpha machine, and it died after a week. =(
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *arrrgghh*
