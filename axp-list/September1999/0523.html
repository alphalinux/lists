<EM>&gt; Subject: RE: Need JDK1.1.7 compiled against RH6.0 glibc 2.x for Alpha
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; At JavaOne Compaq had a booth advertising their 64-bit 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; version of Java.
</EM><BR>
<P>The demos of the Tru64 port and the stuff running across the net to Tandem's
<BR>
Himalayas were the two neat things about Compaq's booth.  What you saw of
<BR>
the former was Compaq's &quot;FastVM&quot; that apparently is an optimized JIT for
<BR>
64-bit.  It came out of beta around the time of JavaOne.  Haven't gotten to
<BR>
play with it yet but it looks good.  The &quot;SlowVM&quot; &lt;-; on Tru64 works fairly
<BR>
well at any rate.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Anyway.  FWIW, since this was shortly after the release of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the CPML and just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; after (or before?) the announcement of the compilers for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux, I naturally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; asked if they were planning a port of the Digital Unix JDK to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux.  I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; told that I &quot;could probably expect that to occur eventually, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but other items
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are higher on the agenda.&quot;  (Or something similar.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So... it's now been a few months.  Sure would be nice...  :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Unfortunately, the FastVM is only available for Tru64 and AFAIK, VMS/Alpha
<BR>
is next on the list for upgrade to the FastVM.  I think when the Linux/Alpha
<BR>
one comes out it will have the FastVM as well but this is hearsay.
