Michal,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard Henderson could certainly tell you more, but I believe that
<BR>
the floating point emulation code was completely changed.  Instead of using
<BR>
the custom Alpha fp code, the Sparc fp code was dropped in to place. Since
<BR>
it is C code, everything should work fine.  However, you might have found 
<BR>
a bug where the emulated fp behaves like a sparc rather than an alpha. 
<BR>
<P>There are ieee fp standards ambiguities, where several implementations are
<BR>
acceptable.  Alpha chose one way, Sparc chose another.
<BR>
<P>I wouldn't expect this as much on an 21264 because more fp is built into the
<BR>
chip, but I'm betting you have a 21064 or 21164.
<BR>
<P>This will probably be pretty tricky to track down.
<BR>
<P>However, why don't you try to &quot;strace&quot; em86 on both of the kernels and see
<BR>
if anything different shows up. 
<BR>
<P>Actually, it is probably something more insidious, like the emulator relying on
<BR>
a certain fp behavior.
<BR>
<P>Just a guess.

<EM>&gt; To add more information on my posting on the subject from yesterday.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha-specific differences between kernel 2.2.11, for which em86
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; emulator works, and 2.2.12 where em86 is broken consist basically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from two sets - &quot;core_mcpcia/setup&quot; and changes to &quot;math-emu&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support.  Backing out the first set provides ends up with a kernel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which is unbootable for some reasons so I tried to revert only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;math-emu&quot; mods.  To my surprise with 2.2.12 kernel and 2.2.13pre7,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where a contents of arch/alpha/math-emu/ is replaced with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what was in 2.2.11, em86 - or at least Netscape on an emulator -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; works just fine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anybody can shed a light on reasons?  This is quite important issue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to a number of people.
