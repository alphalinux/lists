<P><EM>&gt; Compaq is planning a JDK for Linux/Alpha in the near future.  I can provide

<P>At JavaOne Compaq had a booth advertising their 64-bit version of Java.
<BR>
Strangely, they seemed to emphasize the fact that it was 64-bit and said
<BR>
&quot;Oh yeah, it's for the Alpha&quot; almost as a footnote.  I guess maybe they were
<BR>
just playing to the Java crowd, but it would have been easy to interpret
<BR>
them as saying they had a 64-bit Java running on an arbitrary platform, such
<BR>
as Intel.
<BR>
<P>Anyway.  FWIW, since this was shortly after the release of the CPML and just
<BR>
after (or before?) the announcement of the compilers for Linux, I naturally
<BR>
asked if they were planning a port of the Digital Unix JDK to Linux.  I was
<BR>
told that I &quot;could probably expect that to occur eventually, but other items
<BR>
are higher on the agenda.&quot;  (Or something similar.)
<BR>
<P>So... it's now been a few months.  Sure would be nice...  :)
