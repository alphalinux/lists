Hey guys, I have a DS-10 (Actually 3 of them).  I have Redhat 6.0 and Kernel 2.2.12 installed.  The systems are IDE (Yuck!) and they will be running headless.  The problem I seem to be running into is when I do an FTP, the system locks up after about the 5 file.  I have two that do it and I have tried changing memory just to make sure that wasn't it.  I am running the DEC driver which is supposed to make the 21143 chip run more stable.  Any ideas.  Unfortunately, I have really nothing to stress the systems to see if this occurs during any other process.
<BR>
<P>Any help would be appreciated.
