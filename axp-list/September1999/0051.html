<P><EM>&gt; This goes back to a post that Suyudi Koeswanto posted in early August.  This

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2100 5/x is much on my mind.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It appears that Suyudi at least successfully booted a Sable into Linux even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if X wasn't set up.  I would like to know if others have successfully booted

<EM>&gt; this hardware into RH6.0.  We are going nuts here because we have a 2100
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 5/300 that can boot neither 6.0 nor 5.2 and we're not sure what to do about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anyone else able to (or *not* able to) boot a 2100 into any RedHat flavor?
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm.. It is possible to get a sable running with any linux flavour, the
<BR>
only question is how long it takes you.
<BR>
<P>You didn't tell us at all what you tried to get it booted, no error
<BR>
messages, not how far you got, whether the machine hung, ...
<BR>
So it's really hard to help you.
<BR>
<P>Sorry.
