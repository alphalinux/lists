<P>
I've been having this Alpha crash at random times over the last few months.
<BR>
&nbsp;It can't stay up for longer than a few days and I finally got sick of it.
<BR>
I wrote a program that logs the system stats every 3 minutes.
<BR>
<P>Every 3 minutes the time, system load, % used cpu, tcp cons, udp cons,
<BR>
bindbucket_nr, phy memory, virtual memory, sys cpu%, usr cpu%,
<BR>
interrupts/sec, and context switches/sec are all droped into one line.  Not
<BR>
only is that stuff sent to a file but sent over the network to the network
<BR>
logging machine via. logger.
<BR>
<P>When the system crashed I looked back on that output and viewed the
<BR>
charts/graphs I make with gnuplot to see what happened.
<BR>
<P>In a 3 minute period of time the system went from normal VM usage to over
<BR>
600Mb of virtual memory.  The system reached the limit of the swap
<BR>
partitions and then crashed.  You can see how everything was effected and
<BR>
the exact numbers by going to:   <A HREF="http://www.theshell.com/~blyon/crash/">http://www.theshell.com/~blyon/crash/</A>
<BR>
<P>When the crash happened the system took over the cpu and items like ident
<BR>
and such started to pile up.  Ident requests would not finish searching
<BR>
/proc or whatever they do and more and more would come in so we had a huge
<BR>
backlog of processes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From today on I will be watching for any user process that starts to use
</EM><BR>
more than normal ammounts of VM, but I don't think a user process did this
<BR>
due to the ulimits I have set on the system.
<BR>
<P>The result of this crash is nothing in the log files, and a frozen system.
<BR>
The only thing the system will do is open TCP connections and sit there.
<BR>
So if you were to telnet to it, it would open the connection and then do
<BR>
nothing.
<BR>
<P>I hope this information helps.

<P>Hey, do they test this stuff before it's released?  
<BR>
Sure they do... &quot;it compiles, it's ready!&quot;
