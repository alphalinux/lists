<P>
I tried to get the Dec Unix version of Pro-Engineer running on a pc164,
<BR>
Red Hat 5.2, kernel 2.2.7,  Pro-Engineer version 20, build 9852.  
<BR>
<P>It was a very dificult task.  Machine type is referenced through a
<BR>
&quot;uname -a&quot; in many places, and i had to change several scripts that
<BR>
called the machine type.
<BR>
<P>Also, there are a couple ioctrl calls that were allocated inside dec
<BR>
unix that are missing from linux.  they are:
<BR>
<P>SIOCRPHYSADDR
<BR>
SIOCGIFFLAGS
<BR>
SIOCGIFCONF
<BR>
<P>to fix these, add the following lines to net/core/dev.c:dev_ioctl() and
<BR>
recompile your kernel.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(cmd == 0xc0106914)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cmd = SIOCGIFCONF;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(cmd == 0xc0206911)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cmd = SIOCGIFFLAGS;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(cmd == 0xc01c693e)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cmd = SIOCRPHYSADDR;	
<BR>
<P><P>and this is where the fun ended.  I then ran into licensing issues,
<BR>
specifically the error:
<BR>
<P>ERROR: could not connect to NameServer.
<BR>
<P>and could not continue.
<BR>
I was helped tremendously on this project by a person identified only by
<BR>
&quot;m.&quot;, from perth.  Even though i was unsuccessful, i am still greatful
<BR>
for his help.
<BR>

Subject: Which Tru64 apps work (or don't!) on Alpha Linux?
<BR>
<P><P>There was a note recently about problems getting the Tru64 version of
<BR>
Mathematica to run on Alpha Linux, despite the use of the libraries
<BR>
(looked
<BR>
like an unsupported ioctl() call perhaps) which made me wonder how many
<BR>
different applications folks have tried to do this with.
<BR>
<P>I'd be interested in hearing from anyone who's run a commercial Tru64
<BR>
application on Alpha Linux successfully.  Send me mail with the name of
<BR>
the
<BR>
app and the versions and I'll summarize for the list.  Conversely, if
<BR>
you've
<BR>
tried an application unsuccessfully, I'd be interested in hearing about
<BR>
that
<BR>
as well.
<BR>
<P>Send you mail to tom.morris@alpha-processor.com so we don't bog down the
<BR>
entire list.
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
Tom
