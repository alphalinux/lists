This would be interesting, if it were not for the fact that the 64bit changes to
<BR>
the java code just haven't made it into  SUN's jdk source's.  It is more likely
<BR>
that the 64bitness of the port is enhanced by the Dec's C compiler to gen 32bit
<BR>
pointers &amp; stuff.

<EM>&gt; At JavaOne Compaq had a booth advertising their 64-bit version of Java.

<EM>&gt; Strangely, they seemed to emphasize the fact that it was 64-bit and said

<EM>&gt; &quot;Oh yeah, it's for the Alpha&quot; almost as a footnote.  I guess maybe they were

<EM>&gt; just playing to the Java crowd, but it would have been easy to interpret

<EM>&gt; them as saying they had a 64-bit Java running on an arbitrary platform, such
