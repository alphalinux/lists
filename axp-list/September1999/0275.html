<P>
I did all of what you said, 20 times over and several
<BR>
permutations of it. I followed Jim Paradis instructions to
<BR>
the letter, as well as the instructions on www.alphalinux.org.
<BR>
I also had about 5 different people so far offer methods that
<BR>
have worked for them. There is nothing wrong with my hardware.
<BR>
I've had NT running on the machine, and all drives, etc. have
<BR>
been tested under Alpha/Linux on other Alpha boxes. I have 
<BR>
written the boot sector of the disk as instructed including
<BR>
the aboot/kernel combo at a 2 block offset. I have upgraded to
<BR>
firmware 1.7. I fail at the point when I try to boot off the
<BR>
hard drive.
<BR>
<P><EM>aboot&gt; 0/a root=/dev/fd0 load_ramdisk=1
</EM><BR>
<P>This is verbatim what it says on www.alphalinux.org. 
<BR>
<P>Thanks for the help though. I will keep at it as I have been.

<EM>&gt; Hello,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My final plea for help...after almost 3 months of trying to install
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux on a Jensen, I'm at the end of my rope.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I will pay $50 cash to the first person to lead me to the first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RH6.0 installation screen. I need the capability of booting off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the harddrive. You can either arrange to stop by, mail me a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; floppy image which will work, or talk me through on the phone.
</EM><BR>
<P>The howto says you'll never get a floppy install to work.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This is probably a 10 minute job but I've wasted hundreds of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hours of work on it already. The box is slow as molasses...it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the principle of the matter!!!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From looking at the install instructions, I'd say you
</EM><BR>
better talk to Jim Paradis. Without his utilities you won't 
<BR>
get it to work unless you maybe take out the drive 
<BR>
and connect it to another SRM based Alpha and install 
<BR>
it there. Might be able to get by with just making the 
<BR>
HD bootable from another box. Even then, Jensens look 
<BR>
pretty messed up compared to a PCI based Alpha.
<BR>
<P>So, it seems your main problem is to get the hard disk
<BR>
bootable. Also, the method used to make Jensens bootable
<BR>
is not the same as a newer SRM based system. You have to
<BR>
create a combination aboot/kernel back to back according to
<BR>
the howto I read.
<BR>
<P>Personally, I don't think it's worth the time to mess with
<BR>
but to each his own.
