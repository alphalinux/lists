<EM>&gt; I'd been having some odd lockups of my PC164LX machines... they'd be

<EM>&gt; fine, and then they'd be pingable but you can't log in, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; console is unresponsive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I got on one right before it crashed and netstat -to showed the timers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weren't changing. Then later I got on aother right before it crashed,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and realized that &quot;date&quot; wasn't changing. Then I made a script which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ran date on each machine every 10 seconds. Machines that crash
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; definitely have stopped clocks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Given that I saw this under 2.0.35 and 2.2.5-16 (rh 6.0's kernel), I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't think it's a kernel bug. The only hardware oddity that I know of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is that when you reboot these guys, the cmos date is always wrong. I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to replace all the batteries... could that possibly cause this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; symptom?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd guess it's worth a try... I finally replaced the battery on my 164SX
<BR>
after two years.  For the last six months it had been losing the time when
<BR>
I powered off, although the clock was fine (both CMOS and kernel clock) as
<BR>
long as the board was powered up.  The time never advanced when the power
<BR>
was off... on the next boot it would have exactly the same time as on the
<BR>
last shutdown.
<BR>
<P>I've never had a lockup, but I don't have an LX either. Perhaps it would
<BR>
have exhibited other strange symptoms if I kept running with the dead
<BR>
battery.
<BR>
<P>It seems the batteries don't last long in these things anyway.
