Well just one cross post and then we'll make that list on ALO. :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Send you mail to tom.morris@alpha-processor.com so we don't bog down the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; entire list.

<P>I've had success with:
<BR>
Netscape Commmunator 4.x
<BR>
Adobe Acrobat Reader 3.x and 4.x
<BR>
CVSup
<BR>
<P>Using DU 4.0 D libs.
<BR>
With acroread you have to move the existing pthread.so and pthreads.so
<BR>
out of the way and instead link those names to libc.so. Not doing so
<BR>
will cause acroread to die with a failure to call DECthreads (in the
<BR>
kernel?). I once helped a gentelmen try and get DU Mathematica up and
<BR>
running though I lost touch with him and I'm not sure if he succeeded.
<BR>
We got the Mathematica kernel working but the front end would die. I
<BR>
don't remember the error. 
<BR>
<P>I suggested installing the i386 Linux version of Mathematica using em86.
<BR>
In this case the front end works but the kernel dies when it starts. So
<BR>
you could run it so you had the emulated frontend and the Alpha native
<BR>
backend. I suggested this and then never heard from him again. Maybe it
<BR>
worked , I don't know. I really haven't had access to other DU
<BR>
applications to test them.
