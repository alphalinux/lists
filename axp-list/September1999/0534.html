<EM>&gt; I got on one right before it crashed and netstat -to showed the timers

<EM>&gt; Given that I saw this under 2.0.35 and 2.2.5-16 (rh 6.0's kernel), I

<EM>&gt; don't think it's a kernel bug. The only hardware oddity that I know of

<EM>&gt; is that when you reboot these guys, the cmos date is always wrong. I'm

<P>Well, my 164LX machines have been locking up, too.  It happend again 
<BR>
yesterday on my desktop machine.  I was on a VC when it locked up.  I
<BR>
could still switch consoles, but couldn't type anything.  The machine
<BR>
was still pingable, but I couldn't log in remotely.  When I switched to
<BR>
VC #7 (where X was running) I couldn't change back.  This was with kernel
<BR>
2.2.12pre4.  I have since upgraded to 2.2.12pre14 and turned on the 
<BR>
magic SysReq keys.   It hasn't locked up yet...
<BR>
<P>BTW, I believe that this machine's battery is ok.  I don't know if the
<BR>
clock stopped or not when it hung.
