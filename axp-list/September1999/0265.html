<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I tried it also with the &quot;latest&quot; version 0.91g but this version does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not work at all (no connection).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Does anyone know which version of the tulip driver work for the chip
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; used by Ruffian UX motherboards (or which options to use)
</EM><BR>
<P>I have at this moment an UX on my desk which &quot;talks&quot; to the network
<BR>
using tulip 0.91g driver and an onboard ethernet card.  A week ago, or
<BR>
so, I was transferring around 3 GB of data (yes, gigabytes) in one shot
<BR>
between two UX machines equipped in exactly the same way.  These
<BR>
machines would not pass a single packet between them, does not matter if
<BR>
de4x5 or one of versions of tulip is used, when connected back-to-back
<BR>
with a null cable.  Trying to force these or other behaviour with a help
<BR>
of various options does not change the picture.  But when they go
<BR>
through an ethernet hub then everything is fine.
<BR>
<P>Maybe you have still another kind of a transceiver in your hardware,
<BR>
or maybe it just does not like to negotiate with that kind of a hub
<BR>
you are trying.  Unfortunately a built-in ethernet on UX is known
<BR>
to be quirky.  With various available versions of a tulip driver
<BR>
maybe you will get lucky with one?
<BR>
<P>On Donald Becker's pages you can find sources for 'tulip-diag' program.
<BR>
It does compile on Alpha (maybe with minor tweaks).  Try to see if
<BR>
it has anything profound to say about your setup.  Another option
<BR>
is to bypass this built-in and add another ethernet port on a PCI card.
<BR>
That solution is not unheard of. :-(
