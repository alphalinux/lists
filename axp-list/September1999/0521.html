<P>
I'd been having some odd lockups of my PC164LX machines... they'd be
<BR>
fine, and then they'd be pingable but you can't log in, and the
<BR>
console is unresponsive.
<BR>
<P>I got on one right before it crashed and netstat -to showed the timers
<BR>
weren't changing. Then later I got on aother right before it crashed,
<BR>
and realized that &quot;date&quot; wasn't changing. Then I made a script which
<BR>
ran date on each machine every 10 seconds. Machines that crash
<BR>
definitely have stopped clocks.
<BR>
<P>Given that I saw this under 2.0.35 and 2.2.5-16 (rh 6.0's kernel), I
<BR>
don't think it's a kernel bug. The only hardware oddity that I know of
<BR>
is that when you reboot these guys, the cmos date is always wrong. I'm
<BR>
going to replace all the batteries... could that possibly cause this
<BR>
symptom?
<BR>
<P>I haven't had this much fun with clocks since I realized that flipping
<BR>
the front-panel switch on a PDP-11 that turns off the clock breaks
<BR>
Kermit, and little else.
