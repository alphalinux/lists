<P><EM>&gt; Which mozilla did you try, was it a recent one ? Apart from being slow, how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does it work ? As far as I understood from their web page, there should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a beta version in a month or so. From the experience with previous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; milestones, is the beta version likely to work O.K. on alpha ?

<P>Hallo,
<BR>
<P>I've tried a few different Mozillas and debug version of Mozilla-100898 always seem to work the best for
<BR>
me. It isn't too slow, I thought it was fine until I ran NS for the first time on this system and WOW!
<BR>
Mozilla works &quot;okay&quot; for pages with only HTML on them. It loads slashdot fine with two exceptions; it loads
<BR>
the ads in the wrong place (in the middle of the first article usually), and if you login and load the
<BR>
front page it will ALWAYS crash! There is no SSL support, which was something I really wanted. Its biggest
<BR>
problem with loading pages seems to be the ads, it gets stuck on them 90% of the time and you have to click
<BR>
stop. It often corrupts preferences.js, my half work around is to &quot;chmod -w&quot; it, then keep a backup copy
<BR>
outside of the .netscape folder. This stopped about 75% of the corruptions. About once every two weeks I
<BR>
had to go into .netscape and do a &quot;rm -rf *&quot; because it would load then just crash, or load one page then
<BR>
crash.
<BR>
<P>I'm not abandoning Mozilla as I would like to see it mature and one day (hopefully) replace NS and will
<BR>
continue to use it, just now as often.
<BR>
<P>I believe that all? of the current Mozillas will compile on all supported platforms. At least thats what I
<BR>
remember from reading the mozilla news group. If someone knows of a Mozilla that is &quot;known&quot; to be more
<BR>
stable then Mozilla-100898 feel free to point it out!
<BR>
