<P>
Stefan,
<BR>
<P>About all the info we have is that the boot loader shows:
<BR>
<P>&quot;aboot: ok, now starting the kernel&quot;
<BR>
<P>...and hangs forever!
<BR>
<P>I don't know what you can do with this &quot;info&quot;.  Tried: generic kernel from
<BR>
the bootable 6.0 CD-ROM (and from a created boot floppy just for fun) and
<BR>
the latest kernel from gatekeeper.  NOTHIN'....

<EM>&gt; &gt; This goes back to a post that Suyudi Koeswanto posted in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; early August.  This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is not so much a reply to that but the subject matter, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; namely AlphaServer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 2100 5/x is much on my mind.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It appears that Suyudi at least successfully booted a Sable 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into Linux even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; if X wasn't set up.  I would like to know if others have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; successfully booted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; this hardware into RH6.0.  We are going nuts here because 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we have a 2100
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 5/300 that can boot neither 6.0 nor 5.2 and we're not sure 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what to do about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Anyone else able to (or *not* able to) boot a 2100 into any 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RedHat flavor?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hmm.. It is possible to get a sable running with any linux 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; flavour, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only question is how long it takes you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You didn't tell us at all what you tried to get it booted, no error
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; messages, not how far you got, whether the machine hung, ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So it's really hard to help you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sorry.
