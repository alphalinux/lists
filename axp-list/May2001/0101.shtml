<P>
I've got a question for the list that may or may not pertain to linux in
<BR>
general.  i have an axppci33 board that i want to make into an alpha-based
<BR>
linux server.  i am experiencing difficulties assembling it into a working
<BR>
system.
<BR>
<P>i have built many intel-based systems (linux and non-linux) and am familiar
<BR>
with all the peculiarities involved with them, but this board appears to be
<BR>
baffling me.  this board has two 'at-style' power connectors.  truthfully,
<BR>
i am at a loss for which one should be connected....are is it both?
<BR>
connecting the at power supply to the upper connector results in the power
<BR>
supply not even coming on (ie. power supply fan not spinning).  connecting
<BR>
the power supply to the lower connector allows the ps fan to spin, but i
<BR>
get nothing in the way of a display on-screen or machine beeps and such.
<BR>
<P>the board has an alpha 166 processor, which came pre-mounted.  i have four
<BR>
ecc simms installed.  i am using an s3-based PCI video card (recommended,
<BR>
according to the howto's I've come across).  the only thing is...the
<BR>
motherboard doesn't appear to have any onboard cache...meaning, the slots
<BR>
that appear to hold it are all empty.  i don't know how relevant that is to
<BR>
the matter.
<BR>
<P>while i have seen many linux/alpha howto's, could anybody point me in the
<BR>
direction of a general alpha assembly howto...or depart me some knowledge
<BR>
that might send me in the right direction?  any help would be greatly
<BR>
appreciated.  thanks.
