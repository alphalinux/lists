Hi there,
<BR>
<P>I went througt the mailing list archive and found lots of information on
<BR>
graphics cards for alpha linux. but it is a little bit confusing. some
<BR>
say ati cards work for them but not for others and so on ...
<BR>
<P>is there a place (e.g. webpage) where i can find which card works for
<BR>
which configuration?
<BR>
<P>unfortunately i do not have the possibility to try many different cards.
<BR>
i at least tried an permedia2 card which worked on rh6.2 but not on 7.0.
<BR>
but only with an refresh rate of 60 Hz in 1280x1024/depth24 mode which
<BR>
gives a very flickering picture. but this is the mode i need for some
<BR>
software packages (e.g. IDL).
<BR>
<P>until now we used Matrox MI and MII cards. But these only have 4 megs
<BR>
which is not enough. At home I'm running an Geforce2mx on an x86 with
<BR>
XFree-4.0.2 which is capable of DirectColor visuals which would be the
<BR>
preferred one on the alphas. I found some information that it might be
<BR>
possible to use the pci version of this card on an alpha (id need it for
<BR>
a 164lx).
<BR>
<P>Can somebody help me??
<BR>
<P>TIA
<BR>
Peter
