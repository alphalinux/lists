<P>
Why not just stick a loopback connector into the card you are not using (or
<BR>
remove it)?

<P><EM>&gt; What does that mean? I have built an alpha 500a and a 600a using the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; internal NIC cards. Every thing works fine, then out of nowhere I start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; getting this error. It is follow by media is unconnected link down or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incompatable connection. Have my NIC cards gone bad?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>i had the same problem on my box, with 2 eth boards, and one unpluged .
<BR>
the driver kept complaining about the link down, and printing media is TP
<BR>
(==rj45 if i understood the code)
<BR>
<P>my fix was to patch the driver so this warning has a debug level,
<BR>
that way it won't show up on the console/logs unless configured otherwise .
<BR>
<P>I don't have the patch by hand, if you're interested I can try to dig it at
<BR>
home,
<BR>
and mail it to you off list ...
