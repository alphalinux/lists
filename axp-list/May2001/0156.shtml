<P>
I was just thinking the same thing a couple of days ago as we had
<BR>
90+ degree weather here in Portland, Oregon.  :-)
<BR>
<P>I too have a LX.  It has four fans + the cpu fan.  Sometimes I think
<BR>
the two IBM drives I have in it make more noise than the fans.   Still,
<BR>
I'd really like to cut out the noise.  Interestingly enough before
<BR>
this balmy heat wave, /. had a article on a watercooled case.
<BR>
To me, it looks very interesting and tempting.  I would appriciate
<BR>
any feedback.  The company selling them is here: <A HREF="http://www.koolance.com">http://www.koolance.com</A>
<BR>
My only thoughts on this case are the whether on not the cooler
<BR>
attachment would fit over a Alpha 21164A CPU.  In a worst case scenario,
<BR>
I think I may have to leave the heatsink on it and put the cooler on the
<BR>
heatsink.  I'm not sure how efficient that would be.  Then there's the
<BR>
other matter of the CPU fan ok indicator to the motherboard...  I imagine
<BR>
that the fan will still need to be connected so the board did not shut
<BR>
itself down.
<BR>
<P>Can anyone else please share any other thoughts/ideas/experiences?

<EM>&gt; Has anyone here ever used watercooling on an alpha?  Maybe some of you

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I periodically read some of the articles over at www.overclockers.com, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it sounds like watercooling materials have become much more refined just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the past year or two (water blocks, radiators, pumps, etc.).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; While I have no plans to overclock either my as200 or my LX, the thought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of significantly reducing the noise in my computer room is very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attractive.  The only problem I can see is that most (all?) Alpha cpus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have threaded posts for screwing down the heatsinks to them--those posts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would make it necessary to fabricate a custom waterblock (a waterblock is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; basically a sealed heatsink which water flows through to carry heat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; away, much like flowing air through the fins of a conventional heatsink).
