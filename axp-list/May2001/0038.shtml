<BR>
<EM>&gt; I completely agree with you there, but it's like a mouse trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take on a buffalo. You end up doing what you have to in order to keep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your mail servers running.
</EM><BR>
<P>Wheee, aren't we off-topic? :)
<BR>
<P>I favour a different approach.
<BR>
<P>For this virus to infect your company network requires that one of your
<BR>
employees is silly enough to blindly double-click on the pretty picture
<BR>
associated with the file they've just received from somewhere outside the
<BR>
company.
<BR>
<P>That action is the result of either negligence, malice or ignorance on the
<BR>
part of the offending user. As the dangerous nature of this kind of thing is
<BR>
public knowledge, since the Melissa virus, the ignorance excuse can be
<BR>
summarily dismissed, and we're left with only offences for which that user
<BR>
can be dismissed from their employment and sued for damages.
<BR>
<P>So sack them. And sue them. And _then_ maybe the others will get the 
<BR>
message.
<BR>
<P>As far as I'm concerned, the same goes for users accepting Word documents 
<BR>
from across security boundaries.
<BR>
<P>cf. <A HREF="http://www.infradead.org/fileexchange.html">http://www.infradead.org/fileexchange.html</A>
<BR>
<P>I should probably add a note to that explaining the potential danger of 
<BR>
HTML when combined with a too-trusting HTML viewer.
