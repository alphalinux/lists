</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   This is more applicable to cluster computers, but I was wondering if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   anyone has remote hardware monitoring and control capabilities for Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   clusters.  Something like on the IBM SP systems, where a master node can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   monitor power, temperature, and fan activity of each chassis, and turn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   it on/off from the HMON GUI.  I think this kind of feature becomes a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   necessity once your cluster grows to more than 64 nodes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
It depends upon what you mean by Alpha Clusters.
<BR>
<P>What you are describing is the standard console on the Wildfire systems --
<BR>
same as on the SP systems. This has the added advantage of working &quot;out of
<BR>
band&quot; -- meaning that you don't need a working operating system to power
<BR>
cycle the CPU.
<BR>
<P>You can monitor all of the things you are interested in via SNMP. On a good
<BR>
day, you can even control them with it. (Aside from the fact that it only
<BR>
runs on NT, Compaq's Insight Manager provides &quot;agents&quot; for Tru64 and I
<BR>
believe now, Alpha Linux.)
<BR>
<P>The basic problem with Big Brother and similar things is that they are
<BR>
oriented at monitoring various Processes, not Hardware. And in general they
<BR>
are not oriented towards controlling anything. (Obviously, since they are
<BR>
script based, you CAN make them do virtually anything -- but that takes
<BR>
work.) 
<BR>
<P>However, neither the Wildfire nor the SP systems are &quot;ClusterD computers,&quot;
<BR>
from the VMS point of view.
<BR>
<P>Tru64 supports True Cluster -- which is finally (in 5.1), almost a VMS
<BR>
cluster, which is the only real cluster, despite Sun's claims to having
<BR>
invented clustering and Microsoft's attempts to prove that clustering can
<BR>
never work. The various Linux clusters are more akin to the LSF - load
<BR>
sharing facility than to either the Wildfire type box or a Tru-Cluster.
