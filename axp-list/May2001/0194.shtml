<P><EM>&gt;It depends upon what you mean by Alpha Clusters.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What you are describing is the standard console on the Wildfire systems --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;same as on the SP systems. This has the added advantage of working &quot;out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;band&quot; -- meaning that you don't need a working operating system to power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cycle the CPU.
</EM><BR>
<P>In my case, it would be a bunch of Alpha servers, probably UP2000
<BR>
class.  On the console, I see a &quot;show power&quot; command, but the numbers
<BR>
it gives back do not seem to correlate directly with anything.  It
<BR>
would be nice to be able to monitor that through software running on
<BR>
the O/S (probably Linux of some sort), and be able to communicate that
<BR>
information to a remote system.  The SP systems can do this with the
<BR>
O/S running or not.  On most systems I know of, the console is not
<BR>
available while the O/S is running, and vice-versa.  IBM has a
<BR>
clustered Pentium product that uses a separate PPC processor that
<BR>
connects to a separate diagnostic bus that allows remote monitoring and
<BR>
control of the system.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;You can monitor all of the things you are interested in via SNMP. On a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;day, you can even control them with it. (Aside from the fact that it only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;runs on NT, Compaq's Insight Manager provides &quot;agents&quot; for Tru64 and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;believe now, Alpha Linux.)
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The basic problem with Big Brother and similar things is that they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;oriented at monitoring various Processes, not Hardware. And in general they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are not oriented towards controlling anything. (Obviously, since they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;script based, you CAN make them do virtually anything -- but that takes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;work.) 
</EM><BR>
<P>I noticed that looking at their (and Big Sister's) web sites.  It does
<BR>
not look like what I need.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;However, neither the Wildfire nor the SP systems are &quot;ClusterD computers,&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from the VMS point of view.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Tru64 supports True Cluster -- which is finally (in 5.1), almost a VMS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cluster, which is the only real cluster, despite Sun's claims to having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;invented clustering and Microsoft's attempts to prove that clustering can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;never work. The various Linux clusters are more akin to the LSF - load
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sharing facility than to either the Wildfire type box or a Tru-Cluster.
</EM><BR>
<P>VMS clustering is neat and had some very powerful concepts that many
<BR>
wannabes are trying to copy and claim originality.  However, the only
<BR>
thing I would like to exploit from that is the clustered file system.
<BR>
I like the ability to have full concurrent access to a common file
<BR>
system from a number of hosts.  I'm looking at GFS to implement similar
<BR>
capabilities.
