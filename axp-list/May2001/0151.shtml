Hi Axp-List!
<BR>
<P>I've got an AlphaStation 200 4 (21064) clocked with
<BR>
233 MHz and the Alpha CPU gets really really hot!!!
<BR>
Maybe it's overclocked? You truly can burn your fingers on it.
<BR>
I have a cooler on the CPU and a fan blowing fresh air from
<BR>
the front. The cooler is mounted with 2 screws on the CPU
<BR>
so I can't read any information on the CPU itself
<BR>
(maybe it's a 150 MHz version???). There is a 466.67 MHz clock
<BR>
installed near to the &quot;431 Socket&quot;.
<BR>
<P>How can I find out if my CPU/AlphaStation was really made
<BR>
for 233 MHz? Becouse I never thought that a CPU
<BR>
can work in such a very high temperature.
<BR>
Maybe it's normal for Alpha CPU's...
<BR>
<P>Can anyone report to me, if other 21064's (233MHz version) get terribly
<BR>
hot at 233 MHz? (with cooler!)
<BR>
<P>PS: I never had hardware problems with my AS200. Everything
<BR>
works great (for months) only the CPU gets hot...
<BR>
