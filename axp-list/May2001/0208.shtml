<P>
Mark,
<BR>
<P>Agree with Phil re initial check of NIC mode.  If you are using RJ45, what
<BR>
type of hub are you using?  There are issues around auto-negotiation with
<BR>
some network hubs/switches etc, you may need to decide upon a standard
<BR>
setting and fix both ends for each of the Alpha's to get a stable link
<BR>
(e.g.,  FastFD - 100M full duplex, and set the switch for this too).

<P><P>Hello again...
<BR>
<P>Hmmm...my message was cropped. lets try again :-)
<BR>
<P>Actually, I believe its reversed. The round connecter with T 's and coax
<BR>
cable are referred to as BNC connectors - not Twisted pair.   Your right
<BR>
both can be used for ethernet connections....
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Mark,
<BR>
<P>You could doublecheck that the console parameters are correct for the
<BR>
NIC card(s) in question. 
<BR>
At the console prompt
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;sho dev
</EM><BR>
<P>ewa0
<BR>
<P>The nic cards will list *something* like the above 
<BR>
To see what its set for:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;sho ewa0_mode
</EM><BR>
<P>To see what modes are available, try setting it to a nonsense value
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; set ewa0_mode hkhjlasj 
</EM><BR>
<P>and it will return the possible values for that card.... 
<BR>
<P>Not sure console settings really apply in your case, since it seems it
<BR>
works for a while before failing. Are these two system point to point?
<BR>
Perhaps the problem occurs when the second one boots and the nics are in
<BR>
disagreement over the mode? 
<BR>
<P>Phil !

<P><P>Hi Mark,
<BR>
<P>TP probably means Twisted Pair, a type of network cable. What connection
<BR>
are
<BR>
you using?
<BR>
Mostly RJ45 is used, which looks like a square plug, usually made of
<BR>
clear
<BR>
plastic. Twisted Pair
<BR>
is connected using round connectors, needing T pieces in the back of the
<BR>
network card, and terminators
<BR>
on the cable, whereas RJ45, or UTP, or Ethernet (all the same thing)
<BR>
plugs
<BR>
straight into the card.
<BR>
<P>Your NIC card must have a setting somewhere which enables you to set
<BR>
which
<BR>
type is is to use.
