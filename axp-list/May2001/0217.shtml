Greetings all,
<BR>
<P>Many thanks to Michal for assistance with finding the
<BR>
alternate superblock in an EXT2 partition.
<BR>
<P>What is the best method for setting a Intel Pro 100+
<BR>
(82559) network card to 100mbit full duplex? I have a
<BR>
switch and the autodetection is not setting the
<BR>
interface to the correct settings, all I get is 10mbit
<BR>
half duplex out of it, despite repeated ifdown/ifup.
<BR>
The doc says its defualt is auto. SRM 5.8-1 on my LX
<BR>
doesn't have an embedded driver and can't set any of
<BR>
its parameters from console. The 21143a based Kingston
<BR>
card went belly up and had to be replaced.  It was a
<BR>
lot easier to configure that controller even with the
<BR>
OS halted.
<BR>
<P>Also, I'm having trouble with my QLA 1080 (U2)
<BR>
controller.  I just &quot;tweaked&quot; the NVRAM settings (from
<BR>
a PC where the setup program and NVRAM dump could
<BR>
actually run). While the settings were well within
<BR>
limits for what the controller/devices were capable of
<BR>
and was defined using the guide from Qlogic's own
<BR>
site, I'm getting repeated &quot;command timeout on
<BR>
controller/target.&quot;  I'm running a modularized 2.4.3
<BR>
kernel, and am suspecting the Qlogic driver (1280*.o)
<BR>
may not be reading the NVRAM parameters correctly. The
<BR>
error is a timeout for a command on controller 1 (the
<BR>
1080) to target 0, the 1040C controller (controller 0)
<BR>
running the boot drive is not affected despite being
<BR>
similarly tuned at an NVRAM level (however, the driver
<BR>
is different). This occurs regardless of whether a
<BR>
device is attached to the single internal 68 pin
<BR>
connector or not. My first question is how to view the
<BR>
version of this driver and if possible to either find
<BR>
the source and recompile it or a more recent
<BR>
precompiled version. My second question is where might
<BR>
I find either of these? The link I had for the older
<BR>
drivers (the 1020) are invalid. 
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
<P>--KE
