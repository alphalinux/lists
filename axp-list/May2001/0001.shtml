Hi Will,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;JumpStart! 1.4.1 works fine on the Jensen we have in the lab here, so I'm 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;going to assume that it's something about your setup that is &gt; causing the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;failure.
</EM><BR>
<P>Would you please be more specific about &quot;setup&quot; you refered to ?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Most of the JumpStart problems I see (especially with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Jensens) are caused by a bad CD - it seems that the CD-ROM drives in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Jensen machines are prety picky. Could you try burning a new CD (at a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lower speed, like 4)? the &quot;attempt to read past eof&quot; could indicate &gt;that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;part of the CD is damaged..
</EM><BR>
<P>Speed=4 failed as well. I used speed=2 and JumpStar! starts but
<BR>
after the SETUP and EXPRESS steps, during the partitioning/format
<BR>
it displays:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making file system of type ext2 on /dev/sda3
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kernel panic: Unable to find empty ecb for aha1740
<BR>
in swapper task - not syncing
<BR>
<P>Then, JumpStart! gets stuck. My host is aha-1742A, so I do not understand 
<BR>
why it says aha1740.
<BR>
Would you please explain the nature of this error message ?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Notice that I am running Alpha System ROM 1.7 and SRM 32f.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Hmm. I think my machine has ROM 2.2, SRM 370. You might want to &gt;upgrade,if 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you can find the firmware. It should be available here:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;<A HREF="http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/readmes/dec2000.html">http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/readmes/dec2000.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<P>I have a Compaq CD-ROM with new firmware. But the point is if I upgrade 
<BR>
firmware I would *NOT* be able to get my video card working with Linux. As 
<BR>
far as I understand firmware 1.9 and 2.2 will not
<BR>
accept the video card supported by Linux/XFree86, in this case I will
<BR>
use an ELSA Winner 1000 S3 928 EISA. I tried a Diamond Stealth PRO
<BR>
but it did not worked. Would it be okay to upgrade to firmware 2.2 and then 
<BR>
make JumpStart! jump, and then downgrade to firmware 1.7 to
<BR>
make it compatible with video card supported by XFree86?
<BR>
Would you be so kind in providing more information about the video card you 
<BR>
use on your RedHat-Jensen with firmware 2.2 ?
<BR>
This information is really important to the Alpha Jensen community.
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luiz
