<P>
I have a Digital 500a workstation with NT 4.0 installed.  I wanted to install linux, so I changed the CMOS setting to SRM and proceeded to boot off of the cdrom and install linux.  However, something I noticed prior to install has come back to haunt me.  When I ran a &quot;show device&quot; form the SRM console it did not find my SCSI disk drives.  It showed the cdrom, floppy, network card, and IDE interfaces but no scsidisk drives.  I was able to install linux onto the 2nd scsi drive but once I rebooted after the install the &quot;show device&quot; command again failed to show scsi disk drives.  
<BR>
<P>The windows NT distribution sees the scsi disk drives fine.  I upgraded the alphabios incase that was the problem, but no luck, same issue with the lack of seeing the scsi disk drives in the SRM console.
<BR>
<P>Can anybody offer any help?
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
