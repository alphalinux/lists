<EM>&gt;   &gt;However, neither the Wildfire nor the SP systems are &quot;ClusterD computers,&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt;from the VMS point of view.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt;Tru64 supports True Cluster -- which is finally (in 5.1), almost a VMS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt;cluster, which is the only real cluster, despite Sun's claims to having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt;invented clustering and Microsoft's attempts to prove that clustering can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt;never work. The various Linux clusters are more akin to the LSF - load
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt;sharing facility than to either the Wildfire type box or a Tru-Cluster.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   VMS clustering is neat and had some very powerful concepts that many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   wannabes are trying to copy and claim originality.  However, the only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   thing I would like to exploit from that is the clustered file system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   I like the ability to have full concurrent access to a common file
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   system from a number of hosts.  I'm looking at GFS to implement similar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   capabilities.
</EM><BR>
<P>That was the major thing which happened in 5.1 -- Cluster File system and a
<BR>
single system image to boot everybody from! 
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;   &gt;What you are describing is the standard console on the Wildfire systems --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt;same as on the SP systems. This has the added advantage of working &quot;out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt;band&quot; -- meaning that you don't need a working operating system to power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt;cycle the CPU.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   In my case, it would be a bunch of Alpha servers, probably UP2000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   class.  On the console, I see a &quot;show power&quot; command, but the numbers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   it gives back do not seem to correlate directly with anything.  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   would be nice to be able to monitor that through software running on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   the O/S (probably Linux of some sort), and be able to communicate that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   information to a remote system.  The SP systems can do this with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   O/S running or not.  On most systems I know of, the console is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   available while the O/S is running, and vice-versa.  IBM has a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   clustered Pentium product that uses a separate PPC processor that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   connects to a separate diagnostic bus that allows remote monitoring and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   control of the system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
I don't know the UP2000, but Compaq's DS20s and 40s now all have the same
<BR>
thing. (micro-processor, intellegent power controller for the console) I
<BR>
don't recall if the DS10 does or not, but I believe that it does.  It's
<BR>
called the RMC &quot;Remote Management Console&quot; - It is accessed from the 
<BR>
standard SRM prompt on the &quot;com1 port&quot; via an escape sequence -- ^]^]RCM
<BR>
is the default (yes its transposed).
<BR>
<P>However, other than Insight Manager, there is nothing that supports
<BR>
it... and even Insight Manager probably doesn't as that console is at a
<BR>
serial level.
<BR>
<P>Show Power is the SRM command to &quot;DIsplay information about the power
<BR>
supplies, system fans, CPU fans, and temperature.&quot; At least on the SRM
<BR>
on the DS20E it generates a &quot;narative&quot; description. It's related to the RMC
<BR>
command &quot;status.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Under the latest versions of SRM, the Console (ie SRM) variables are
<BR>
exported, but I don't know which ones.
