<P>
i'd also like to see a simple sample code - but cannot, I tried :-/ . I have
<BR>
submitted the whole module to the gnu-folks, with hopefully some
<BR>
confidiantially. I pointed out the routine &amp; the pieces of the produced .s
<BR>
code that I BELIEVE is wrong.
<BR>
<P>I'd like to think that there is a majic switch out there, but both caller &amp;
<BR>
callee have the same parameter list.
<BR>
I have even taken the proto's from the caller, &amp; stuffed them into the
<BR>
callee. Now no warnings, but still busted..
<BR>
<P>It just seems like that there is some extra 16 bytes of overhead expected by
<BR>
the callee, and not by the caller.

<EM>&gt; I, for one, would be really interested in seeing a sample code which

<EM>&gt; would demonstrate that.  I have seen in the past wrong offsets but they
