Hi guys, 
<BR>
<P>Got a problem with a Jensen. Most people do! I was just wondering if anyone
<BR>
has had any success using the Compaq Jumpstart cd on a Jensen. There are
<BR>
instructions in the readme for use on a Jensen, but I just got a 84 Fail,
<BR>
one of the great helpful error messages. I've worked out before in my many
<BR>
attempts with this system, that an 84 Fail means there is a problem with a
<BR>
boot loader, i.e. its not finding it. I wrote the Jumpstart cd myself on a
<BR>
normal CD-R disc, reads fine in the PC, lots of files on the cd etc,
<BR>
including the bootlx file needed to boot. I'm curious if this is a problem
<BR>
with the cd drive, the cd I burned, or if I'm doing something else wrong. 
<BR>
Also, is there a way of starting the Jumpstart cd from aboot? I presume the
<BR>
jumpstart has aboot in the boot bit, and just automates the bootup, so what
<BR>
would the command be to start it up? 
<BR>
<P><P>I've also tried using the other method, building the jensen.img and
<BR>
ramdisk.img discs, etc, and can get into the RedHat 6.2 install program.
<BR>
Things go fine, until it asks about the timezone. Then a message comes on
<BR>
screen, /dev/port  invalid file or directory. The menus still work, but when
<BR>
I click the ok button, the menu disappears, and the machine does nothing, no
<BR>
activity at all. I left it sitting just in case it was going to do
<BR>
something, but after 10 minutes there was still nothing, so I just switched
<BR>
it off. 
<BR>
<P>Cheers, 
<BR>
<P>Graeme Hogg
