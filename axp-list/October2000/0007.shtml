Hello,
<BR>
This is kind of an off the wall question because I don't know much of
<BR>
the specifics, plus I am new to sys admin, especially with the alpha.
<BR>
Here goes - We have an alpha machine running RH 6.2 w/
<BR>
kernel 2.2.16.  We have a fortran program that writes out a binary data
<BR>
file (DMP file) for each timestep of calculation, plus
<BR>
a number of temporary (TMP) files.  We also have a number of
<BR>
GUI programs written with C and motif.  Everything works fine on our
<BR>
alpha machine (dual 667 MHz).   We have a customer who is running the
<BR>
same operating system and kernel, and the only obvious difference is his
<BR>
<P>is a dual 750 I believe.   He can write out the TMP files, but not the
<BR>
DMP file.  It seg faults as soon as the program opens the DMP file to
<BR>
write.  Also, the GUI programs seg fault  when he's accessing the disk.
<BR>
One wierd bug is if he uses one of the GUI programs compiled for 1 GB
<BR>
Ram (he has 2 GB), it crashes if he does a specific function, but if I
<BR>
compile it for 128 MB Ram, it doesn't crash.  Obviously this is no good,
<BR>
he needs to be able to use a lot of Ram.
<BR>
My question is this:  what should I look into on his machine to setup
<BR>
the memory correctly?  Usually we don't
<BR>
support our customers hardware problems, but we suggested to him that he
<BR>
<P>buy the alpha so we feel a little responsible.
<BR>
Thanks,
<BR>
Ken
