<P>
I've got a fairly large program that I've ported to
<BR>
Linux (Intel and Alpha).  Running some stress tests on
<BR>
the Alpha I found that I was leaking memory (enough to
<BR>
bring the machine down, eventually).  I couldn't find
<BR>
any memory trackers to run on Alpha, so I worked on
<BR>
Intel.  I found some issues (using LeakTracer, which
<BR>
does new/delete stuff) and fixed them. 
<BR>
<P>After a while I ran into a wall because I couldn't
<BR>
seem to fix the all the item LeakTracer was reporting
<BR>
AND I was still leaking memory faster than LeakTracer
<BR>
indicated I should be.  I figured it must be
<BR>
malloc/free stuff.  So I d/l'd mpr (which does
<BR>
EVERYTHING).  It showed me I had some system lib leaks
<BR>
(glibc 2.1.1).  Researching these on the internet, I
<BR>
found some references to taking nisplus out of
<BR>
/etc/nsswitch.conf.  I did this and found it improved.
<BR>
<P>But Alpha is still leaking like all get-out.  I'm
<BR>
reaching the end of my rope, here.  I have multiple
<BR>
problems:
<BR>
<P>1) I don't have any definitive way to prove I have a
<BR>
memory leak.  I keep seeing references to &quot;look at the
<BR>
buffer line, ignore the cache, consult the ham
<BR>
sandwich&quot; but none of it makes sense.
<BR>
<P>2) I can't find any tools for finding mem leaks that
<BR>
will run on Alpha Linux.
<BR>
<P>3) I've never tried to fix mem leaks before and
<BR>
neither has anyone else at my location.  I'm totally
<BR>
lost.
<BR>
<P>Help!
