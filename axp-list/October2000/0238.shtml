<P>
My cd software is Nero, writes the disc ok i think, I don't have the option
<BR>
of choosing mode XA or not, just Data Mode 1, Data Mode 2, Audio or
<BR>
something else. It writes it in ISO format so thats ok. The Jensen uses SRM

<BR>
<P>I had quite a bit of trouble getting my PC164 to read CDR's with the
<BR>
original SCSI 8x Toshiba drive.  After talking to Toshiba the felt their
<BR>
was
<BR>
something wrong with the drive because it should be able to read CDR's.
<BR>
Since I had two of these drives doing the exact same thing I knew they
<BR>
were
<BR>
full of it.  After switching to an newer 36x IDE drive I was at least
<BR>
able
<BR>
to see the drive using milo, but I still couldn't read any CDROM's that
<BR>
read
<BR>
fine on the PC.  I was using Adaptec easy cd creator to make my cdr's.
<BR>
My
<BR>
first mistake was I wasn't burning them using iso9660 format.  The
<BR>
second
<BR>
mistake was under properties for the ISO9660 format there is a setting
<BR>
for
<BR>
mode 1 or mode 2, which sets the format to CDROM or CDROM XA.  I was
<BR>
using
<BR>
CDROM XA by default and milo wouldn't read the disk. After changing that
<BR>
to
<BR>
mode 1 no problems.  I am not sure about aboot since I haven't' used it
<BR>
but
<BR>
it might be a place to start.
<BR>
<P>I gave up on the jumpstart CD, I couldn't make it work.  I am not
<BR>
familiar
<BR>
with a Jensen does it use arc or alpha bios?

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hi guys, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Got a problem with a Jensen. Most people do! I was just 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wondering if anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has had any success using the Compaq Jumpstart cd on a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jensen. There are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instructions in the readme for use on a Jensen, but I just 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; got a 84 Fail,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one of the great helpful error messages. I've worked out 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before in my many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attempts with this system, that an 84 Fail means there is a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boot loader, i.e. its not finding it. I wrote the Jumpstart 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cd myself on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; normal CD-R disc, reads fine in the PC, lots of files on the cd etc,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; including the bootlx file needed to boot. I'm curious if this 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the cd drive, the cd I burned, or if I'm doing something 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; else wrong. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, is there a way of starting the Jumpstart cd from aboot? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I presume the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; jumpstart has aboot in the boot bit, and just automates the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bootup, so what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would the command be to start it up? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've also tried using the other method, building the jensen.img and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ramdisk.img discs, etc, and can get into the RedHat 6.2 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; install program.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Things go fine, until it asks about the timezone. Then a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; message comes on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; screen, /dev/port  invalid file or directory. The menus still 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work, but when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I click the ok button, the menu disappears, and the machine 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does nothing, no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; activity at all. I left it sitting just in case it was going to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something, but after 10 minutes there was still nothing, so I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just switched
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it off. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Cheers, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
