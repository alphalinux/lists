<EM>&gt; How is Alpha prepared to address the mainstream in the next several years?  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people are going to upgrade their computers, how can we make it more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advantageous to get an Alpha than an itanium?
</EM><BR>
<P>The metrics people seem to use are price/performance and availability of
<BR>
software.
<BR>
<P>Alpha has a jump on IA-64 for software, certainly.  We don't know yet how
<BR>
quickly IA-64 will actually penetrate the market.
<BR>
<P>Fast emulation of x86 would certainly help Alpha.  Something like FX!32 running
<BR>
on Linux could be a powerful incentive.  Of course, the availability of good
<BR>
emulation is also a disincentive for ISV's to actually port software, which was
<BR>
a big problem for Alpha/NT and will affect IA-64 as well.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Even the low-cost variants, like UPxx00, are still very expensive for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; majority of computer owners.  In fact, the majority of people don't even buy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the fastest computer available; there's an entire market segment devoted to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the &quot;entry-level&quot; machine.
</EM><BR>
<P>IA-64 won't come cheap either.  The mainstream will continue to run x86 for some
<BR>
time.
<BR>
<P>UPxx00 boxes are actually quite reasonable, especially the new UP1100 mb's.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In order to address current 64-bit computing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technologies' lack of volume, don't we have to appeal to the majority?  Maybe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we are retiring good technologies (LX,SX,etc.), in favor of the latest and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; greatest, too fast to be able to appeal to the majority.  Or are we content to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just appeal to the high end?
</EM><BR>
<P>I say forget the desktop market.  It will always be driven by commodity,
<BR>
low-margin parts.  Build good servers instead, and let market forces decide.
