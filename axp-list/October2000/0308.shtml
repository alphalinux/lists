<P>Okay, let me clarify.  If your performance measure is a nonlinear function of runtime
<BR>
then I could see this (e.g. 6 hours is twice as good as 9 because an engineer working
<BR>
an eight-hour day can make two runs with lessons from the first incorporated into the
<BR>
second; weather modeling is also very time-sensitive).  Also, when &quot;price&quot; only
<BR>
measures system cost and not, say, cost of the operator's labor as they sit and wait
<BR>
for the program to run, then this biases toward the low end; accounting for all costs
<BR>
can make the high-end machine look significantly better, more so with increasing
<BR>
machine load.  But this is more of what I meant by the &quot;raw performance&quot; measure.
<BR>
<P>If a 21264 box is twice as fast but costs four times as much as an Athlon box with the
<BR>
same memory, etc., then just get one Athlon and run it for twice the time and you've
<BR>
beat the 21264's performance/price by a factor of two.  If the program can be run
<BR>
across two or three Athlons then all the better for an Athlon cluster's &quot;raw
<BR>
performance&quot;.  But even if not, if your price measure is linear in system cost and your
<BR>
performance measure inverse-linear in runtime, I don't think you'll find a new Alpha
<BR>
system beating a new Intel/AMD system on any benchmark- exept for...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Other customers need efficient 64-bit integers and not necessarily large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memory.
</EM><BR>
<P>Good point, I can see Alpha doing significantly better here.
<BR>
<P>I used to put dense linear algebra in this category too, but with ATLAS on even a
<BR>
PIII-450 getting about half the performance of Goto's hand-tuned assembler BLAS on
<BR>
LX164-600 (which is only marginally slower per clock than 21264), and with the
<BR>
availability of fast 3DNow!-based assembler BLAS on Athlon (1.5-2 flops/clock, like
<BR>
Goto's), and with Altivec instructions giving PPC G4s a boost here (at least for
<BR>
single-precision: 2 flops/clock sustained, 8 flops/clock &quot;theoretical max&quot;, or so they
<BR>
claim:-), Alpha seems to have lost this battle too.
<BR>
<P>If you find a flaw in this reasoning, please let me know!
