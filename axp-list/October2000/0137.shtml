<P><EM>&gt; I've got a few headaches left with alpha Mandrake... one that is giving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me serious pain is XFree86 4.0.1. When I start the X-server it crashes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the box. I end up on the milo prompt. I have _no_ idea how to debug it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (I don't have C knowledge). Anyone?
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm...I'm still wrestling with our pre-upload XFree86 4.0.1
<BR>
sources.  Things are changing so fast with the DRI code that it's been
<BR>
hard to keep up with.  Besides, I have an ancient S3 card, so I'm not even
<BR>
able to test half of the cool stuff that comes with the new X.  I'm hoping
<BR>
to get a V3 or something newer so that I can package glide3 for Debian and
<BR>
test things a bit more thoroughly.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Another one is the kernel... Mandrake builds 3 kernels out of the kernel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; src.rpm package, secure, smp and the normal one. With the secure and smp
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kernel the via82cxxx
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; driver compilation crashes:
</EM><BR>
<P>Newer VIA driver patches are being posted to linux-kernel almost daily,
<BR>
IIRC.  It might be worthwhile to check out the archived list and see if
<BR>
anything in there helps.  It looks to be easy to fix, though, with a
<BR>
little effort.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Anyway: is it possible to have an via82cxxx device in an alpha machine?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It seems like some (mainly on-board?) soundchip... The weird thing is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that it does compile on the secure and smp kernels...
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure.  It might not be SMP-safe or it could just have portions
<BR>
that are #ifdef'ed out depending on something in the configuration of the
<BR>
kernel.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Mandrake's kernel package also has an other problem: some alsa and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pcmcia patches (#54 &amp; #55) get applied when the alsa and pcmcia sources
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aren't installed, that is, on non-X86. With x86 these things go right.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There seems to be some inconsitency in where the patches are applied.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This weekend I hope to get this stuff sorted out...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mandrake's kdelibs2 package requires alsa, but alsa doesn't get compiled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the alpha kernels in Mandrake. Is there any reason not to compile
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alsa on an alpha?
</EM><BR>
<P>Alsa isn't included in the kernel sources and must be compiled after the
<BR>
kernel.  Mandrake should have some alsa lib or dev packages available
<BR>
somewhere to allow you to compile alsa-enabled apps.  FYI, alsa does work
<BR>
very well on Alpha...in some cases better than the OSS drivers.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &lt;shameless plug&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We could use some help on Mandrake's alpha distro, really, it's fun!!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;/shameless plug&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Hahahaha...unfortunately, lack of hardware and time keep me from working
<BR>
on much other than Debian.  I do generate quite a few patches, though,
<BR>
that should be easily modified to work on other dists (if modification is
<BR>
needed at all).  If you have any specific packages that you're having bad
<BR>
problems with, let me know and I'll see if I can find a patch to help.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I could make a tar.gz file out of it, or grab a copy of rpm2cpio and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extract them with that..
</EM><BR>
<P>That's ok...I have our rpm package installed.  I was just trying to avoid
<BR>
sifting through it.  I've since installed it and am going through the
<BR>
patches now.
