<P>
The Alpha support in the development compilers was one of the main
<BR>
reasons we choose to use it.
<BR>
<P>Compaq was demoing povray rendering races of gcc versus ccc in our
<BR>
(Red Hat's) booth during ALS.  I didn't really like how much ccc was
<BR>
beating gcc (being a fan of Free Software).  So I asked Jim, &quot;Which
<BR>
gcc did you build that with?&quot;  He said &quot;egcs 1.1.2.&quot;  I said, &quot;I'd
<BR>
like to try rebuilding povray with the 2.96 snapshot.&quot;  So we built it
<BR>
with &quot;-O6 -ffast-math -mieee -mcpu-ev6&quot;.  ccc no longer hands us our
<BR>
hat when it comes to the povray render race.  There were a few scenes
<BR>
where the gcc 2.96 built povray *beat* ccc.  Yes, the Compaq compiler
<BR>
guy scrambled over to our booth from the Compaq booth to see what was
<BR>
going on...
<BR>
<P>Currently our mysql package builds with it.  As far as kernel builds
<BR>
go, we had decided long ago to use egcs 1.1.2 to build the kernel, so
<BR>
making gcc 2.96 snapshot build one was never a release criteria.  That
<BR>
was probably a mistake.
<BR>
<P>During development of 7, I was running 2.96 snapshot-built kernels for
<BR>
weeks at a time.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>

<EM>&gt; As usual the RH release ending in a &quot;0&quot; has some nasty problems.  Not sure

<EM>&gt; if anyone has tried it yet, but my advice is to wait.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The GCC installed was a snap shot, and not a stable version.  Although
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this version of GCC is supposed to be better suited to Alphas.

<EM>&gt; I was unable to compile a decent kernel or much else (mysql) with it (oh
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BTW did I mention to compile the kerenl you use kgcc with RH 7.0).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *crash*crash*crash*  Was able to compile very simple kernel, but by scsi
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; adapter and ethernet cards (same as my multia) caused the kernel compile
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to fail.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This was on a x86.   Alpha users may wish to wait for something more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stable and with a compiler that works.  The new X server worked fine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though, I guess that was reason enough to bring out this update??  7.0 is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; NOT ready for a production environment IMHO.  Just a heads up before the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha version hits.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; YMMV
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you do decide to use RH7.0 on your alpha please report back to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; list, I would be curious on your results.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; PS a new 3.0 GCC will be out probably by January, KDE2.0 should be out in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nov or Dec, as well as the new 2.4 kerenl about the same time frame
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Maybe later now just read Linus's update :( ).  This is an exciting time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be a Linux user in general, but on a production machine it may behoove
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people to wait and test a bit before moving up.
