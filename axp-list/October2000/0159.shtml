Another thing that you may want to try is compiling a specific kernel
<BR>
(2.2.13 or later... 2.2.12 had a problem w/ dropping the keyboard and mouse
<BR>
on the server when it booted). I only had a problem with things dropping
<BR>
when I tried running RHat's stock kernels, and not the ones that I compiled
<BR>
myself. When I had the same problems, I looked in the obvious places too
<BR>
(like /var/log/messages) and found nothing to indicate what was going wrong.
<BR>
<P>I've had uptimes in months (until I decide to re-organize my room and reboot
<BR>
the server).... but I haven't had any problems since I've upgraded the
<BR>
kernel (telnet, ftp, etc).

Subject: DEC Server 3300 inexplicably locks up
<BR>
<P><P>I've got a digital Server 3300 running Red Hat 6.2. The install went
<BR>
perfectly. The machine has been idle all Summer (basically running Seti@Home
<BR>
until I had time to work with it).
<BR>
<P>In the first few months of non-use, I had one or two incidents where it
<BR>
would lock up for seemingly no reason at all. It never did it while I was
<BR>
working on the console, but occasionally just telnetting to it would lock it
<BR>
up.
<BR>
<P>Now I'm trying to bring it online as a production box. I've been getting
<BR>
more lock ups as I use it more. I can't find a pattern to what causes them
<BR>
or why. This week I FTPed a bunch of files (500MB) to it from home and tried
<BR>
to FTP those same files to a local machine at work. When FTPing from the
<BR>
3300 I watched the transfer rate drop quickly from hundreds of kb/sec to
<BR>
nothing -- the machine locked up. It was an orderly loss of transfer speed,
<BR>
about 5-10 kps every second.
<BR>
<P>It just died on me again mid-SSH-session. I wasn't doing anything but
<BR>
creating dirs, etc...
<BR>
<P>When left alone, it runs Seti@Home for months at a time (also running
<BR>
Apache/PHP/MySQL daemons, but with NO traffic).
<BR>
<P>Any clues about 1) what could be going on or 2) where I could look for more
<BR>
info about what could be going on (nothing to see in /var/log/messages). I'm
<BR>
using the tulip driver for ethernet (it's got built-in DEC Ethernet).
<BR>
<P>Thanks!
