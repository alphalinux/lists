The SunPCI card is quite amusing actually. All it is is an AMD processor,
<BR>
RAM, Video, sound, etc. that is all integrated to one PCI card. The only
<BR>
parts of the sun machine that it actually uses are the hard drive (your
<BR>
'virtual' drive is a file on the hdd [kinda like VMware]), the CDRom (which
<BR>
doesn't always apear correctly for all things you try to run) and the
<BR>
floppy. It can interface through Sun's video adapter or you can run it
<BR>
through it's own on board video adapter. but again, the only processing that
<BR>
the Sun CPU is actually doing is just the interface (which runs under
<BR>
Xwindows) to the card which actually runs all the x86 apps. If I remember
<BR>
right, for the price of the SunPCI card, you could buy a modest desktop and
<BR>
monitor and run just as fast without having to deal w/ compatibility issues.
<BR>
<P>I agree with you on the pricing. Alpha based computers are a lot more
<BR>
expensive than Intels. One of the biggest things that I've heard is 'if only
<BR>
they cost less I'd buy one'. Sun Microsystems is actually more expensive
<BR>
typically than even Alpha though. Their advantage is that they have a HUGE
<BR>
application base to keep their OS/ arch going, where AlphaLinux just doesn't
<BR>
have the application broadness that both Intel (winblows) and Sun
<BR>
Microsystems (solaris) have built for themselves.
<BR>
<P>I wouldn't expect to see someone with a Sun machine as their home computer
<BR>
either though. There's no way to justify the cost / learning curve
<BR>
associated with them. Home computer users typically want something that they
<BR>
can turn on, surf the web with, do some word processing with, and maybe play
<BR>
some games. Then you turn to the gamers, which are probably one of the
<BR>
bigger drives in the computer industry right now for more horsepower and
<BR>
graphics. Sun hasn't gotten all that much faster until just recently with
<BR>
their UltraSParc-III's because they haven't had the need to. All of their
<BR>
applications typically will run on anything from UltraSparc on up (even
<BR>
HyperSparc depending on the App). They don't run games in solaris. Even as
<BR>
compute servers, you can always just throw more CPUs at the problem and fork
<BR>
the jobs.
<BR>
<P>Sun, SGI, and DEC never designed their products to be on the desk of the
<BR>
home PC user. They were designed as workstations for business and or servers
<BR>
for business where they were suited to doing one type of work. I used to
<BR>
work at one place where the only thing they used Alphas for was for GIS
<BR>
(Geographical Information Systems). There was one group of 10 or so people
<BR>
that used them in the 700+ employee company. Most of the desktops were
<BR>
AS200's with an AS2100 as the database/file server.
<BR>
<P>The older technologies are being retired because current 32bit processors
<BR>
are now able to equal or better the performance of them.

Subject: Positioning the Alpha processor
<BR>
<P><P>A few small segments of the marketplace have been into 64-bit computing for
<BR>
a 
<BR>
while now--mostly for large-scale, highly-specialized applications.  Over
<BR>
the 
<BR>
next couple of years, however, we are likely to see the mainstream begin to 
<BR>
move to 64-bits as well (with the introduction of ia64)--that is, an ISA
<BR>
fully 
<BR>
compatible with the majority of current applications but transitioning to a 
<BR>
new paradigm of computing.  My view is that competing 64-bit technologies 
<BR>
(alpha, sun, sgi, etc.) already have the edge on any upcoming technology,
<BR>
but 
<BR>
they are not positioned to take advantage of the mainstream.  That is, these
<BR>
<P>next several years will provide a unique opportunity for already established
<BR>
<P>64-bit technologies to branch out and take advantage of the rookie ia64
<BR>
bids.  
<BR>
How is Alpha prepared to address the mainstream in the next several years?
<BR>
If 
<BR>
people are going to upgrade their computers, how can we make it more 
<BR>
advantageous to get an Alpha than an itanium?
<BR>
Even the low-cost variants, like UPxx00, are still very expensive for the 
<BR>
majority of computer owners.  In fact, the majority of people don't even buy
<BR>
<P>the fastest computer available; there's an entire market segment devoted to 
<BR>
the &quot;entry-level&quot; machine.  In order to address current 64-bit computing 
<BR>
technologies' lack of volume, don't we have to appeal to the majority?
<BR>
Maybe 
<BR>
we are retiring good technologies (LX,SX,etc.), in favor of the latest and 
<BR>
greatest, too fast to be able to appeal to the majority.  Or are we content
<BR>
to 
<BR>
just appeal to the high end?
<BR>
It seems to me that we need to provide solutions for more than just the high
<BR>
<P>end.  The business sector is seeking to meet a specific set of requirements 
<BR>
for general office computing; the home computing market is seeking to meet
<BR>
yet 
<BR>
another set of requirements.  No current 64-bit technology seems to address 
<BR>
all of these, and none are in the same price range as x86 variants.
<BR>
In addition to competitive pricing, there should be other incentives to 
<BR>
switching platforms.  As an example, Sun has the SunPCi add-on which 
<BR>
&quot;seamlessly&quot; (according to them) integrates Windows programs into the
<BR>
Solaris 
<BR>
operating environment.  We don't have anything like that for Alpha, do we?
<BR>
I brought up these points in an attempt to foster good discussion on salient
<BR>
<P>issues.  These are the questions that have been running around my head for a
<BR>
<P>while now.  Comments are welcome.
