Positioning the Alpha as a Market Leader
<BR>
<P>The Alpha traditionally has an image of being a beast: ferocious performance 
<BR>
with a price that will mangle a budget.  Obviously that's not entirely the 
<BR>
case, but there is no marketing campaign to change the mainstream views about 
<BR>
it.  If the ultimate goal of any product is to make that product accessible 
<BR>
and appealing to the mainstream, then it's the mainstream user that must be 
<BR>
targeted.  Kurt mentioned the gamers as being a major driving force in desktop 
<BR>
computing today.  What gamer wouldn't jump at the chance to &quot;upgrade&quot; to a 
<BR>
more powerful platform, as long as that platform provided the same 
<BR>
functionality as the current one and gave better performance at a reasonable 
<BR>
price?  This would lead to a conclusion that the people responsible for 
<BR>
promoting Alpha (Compaq, API, the user community, etc.) should be concerned 
<BR>
about (a) investing in adding the functionality (to the Alpha application 
<BR>
base) that already exists on x86, (b) investing in the technology that would 
<BR>
pull mainstream users away from their x86s and toward the Alpha, and (c) 
<BR>
advertising Alpha as a viable alternative, overcoming the beast mentality, 
<BR>
etc.  To some extent this is happening, but on a very small scale; a scale 
<BR>
that strikes me as small compared to the size of Compaq and its competitors.  
<BR>
It has been a long time since I've seen a mainstream advertising campaign for 
<BR>
the Alpha--not even any ads in PC Magazine!  Where is the media buzz about 
<BR>
Alpha these days?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I say forget the desktop market.  It will always be driven by commodity,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; low-margin parts.  Build good servers instead, and let market forces decide.
</EM><BR>
Shouldn't we try to address the desktop market, if that's where the real 
<BR>
volume of sales is?  Maybe that's a longer-term goal.
<BR>
Perhaps not the home desktop market, but what about the business desktop?  
<BR>
This discussion is about positioning the Alpha to be a market leader as the 
<BR>
x86 era slowly comes to a draw.  Something will fill that void, but what will 
<BR>
it be.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The metrics people seem to use are price/performance and availability of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software.
</EM><BR>
So these are the things we need to work on, then, to make Alpha a viable 
<BR>
mainstream option for businesses.  This is something we could work on now to 
<BR>
position the Alpha properly for the near-term and mid-term.
<BR>
So let's take software availability.  Yes, we have a jump on infant 
<BR>
technologies, but not *that* much of a jump.  How could Compaq create a &quot;huge 
<BR>
application base&quot; like Kurt mentioned Sun has?   Yes, highly specialized 
<BR>
applications are available and the Linux community is working diligently to 
<BR>
provide things that have traditionally been lacking.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The older technologies are being retired because current 32bit processors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are now able to equal or better the performance of them.
</EM><BR>
So perhaps even Alpha's incredible performance is not enough of a draw for the 
<BR>
average power-hungry consumer?  What sort of a roadmap do we see for Alpha 
<BR>
software development as 32bit processors are retired because of new 
<BR>
OS/application requirements?  This seems like something we should be eminently 
<BR>
concerned with.
<BR>
<P>I am very happy with Compaq's commitment to giving us high-performance 
<BR>
compilers, jumpstart CDs, and the like.  However, in order to develop a large 
<BR>
application base, additional investment in areas that Windows is &quot;good&quot; at: 
<BR>
like support for multimedia hardware and software, comprehensive office 
<BR>
productivity suites, etc. (things I'm sure most of us Alpha users have thought 
<BR>
&quot;I sure wish I could do ...&quot; about).
