<P>
A few small segments of the marketplace have been into 64-bit computing for a 
<BR>
while now--mostly for large-scale, highly-specialized applications.  Over the 
<BR>
next couple of years, however, we are likely to see the mainstream begin to 
<BR>
move to 64-bits as well (with the introduction of ia64)--that is, an ISA fully 
<BR>
compatible with the majority of current applications but transitioning to a 
<BR>
new paradigm of computing.  My view is that competing 64-bit technologies 
<BR>
(alpha, sun, sgi, etc.) already have the edge on any upcoming technology, but 
<BR>
they are not positioned to take advantage of the mainstream.  That is, these 
<BR>
next several years will provide a unique opportunity for already established 
<BR>
64-bit technologies to branch out and take advantage of the rookie ia64 bids.  
<BR>
How is Alpha prepared to address the mainstream in the next several years?  If 
<BR>
people are going to upgrade their computers, how can we make it more 
<BR>
advantageous to get an Alpha than an itanium?
<BR>
Even the low-cost variants, like UPxx00, are still very expensive for the 
<BR>
majority of computer owners.  In fact, the majority of people don't even buy 
<BR>
the fastest computer available; there's an entire market segment devoted to 
<BR>
the &quot;entry-level&quot; machine.  In order to address current 64-bit computing 
<BR>
technologies' lack of volume, don't we have to appeal to the majority?  Maybe 
<BR>
we are retiring good technologies (LX,SX,etc.), in favor of the latest and 
<BR>
greatest, too fast to be able to appeal to the majority.  Or are we content to 
<BR>
just appeal to the high end?
<BR>
It seems to me that we need to provide solutions for more than just the high 
<BR>
end.  The business sector is seeking to meet a specific set of requirements 
<BR>
for general office computing; the home computing market is seeking to meet yet 
<BR>
another set of requirements.  No current 64-bit technology seems to address 
<BR>
all of these, and none are in the same price range as x86 variants.
<BR>
In addition to competitive pricing, there should be other incentives to 
<BR>
switching platforms.  As an example, Sun has the SunPCi add-on which 
<BR>
&quot;seamlessly&quot; (according to them) integrates Windows programs into the Solaris 
<BR>
operating environment.  We don't have anything like that for Alpha, do we?
<BR>
I brought up these points in an attempt to foster good discussion on salient 
<BR>
issues.  These are the questions that have been running around my head for a 
<BR>
while now.  Comments are welcome.
