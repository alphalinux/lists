<P>
Thank you for your reply,
<BR>
We have considered dynamically allocating this code, but we haven't had time
<BR>
to do it yet, and have not had problems until now.  Even still, if it were
<BR>
solely a bug in the code, why does every bug I mentioned work on our ALPHA
<BR>
machine and not his?  Our ALPHA machine runs the same OS and kernel (RH 6.2
<BR>
and 2.2.16), with the same amount of RAM (2 GB) as his.  Ours is a dual 667
<BR>
MHz and his is a dual 750.  That's the only apparent difference in the
<BR>
machines.
<BR>
Thanks,
<BR>

<EM>&gt; &gt; is a dual 750 I believe.   He can write out the TMP files, but not the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; DMP file.  It seg faults as soon as the program opens the DMP file to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; write.  Also, the GUI programs seg fault  when he's accessing the disk.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; One wierd bug is if he uses one of the GUI programs compiled for 1 GB
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Ram (he has 2 GB), it crashes if he does a specific function, but if I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; compile it for 128 MB Ram, it doesn't crash.  Obviously this is no good,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; he needs to be able to use a lot of Ram.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; My question is this:  what should I look into on his machine to setup
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the memory correctly?  Usually we don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; support our customers hardware problems, but we suggested to him that he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Seems more likely a SW bug than a HW bug. I'd suggest you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have your customer send you his TMP files and you try to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something with them on your system. Why are you compiling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your code for a particular &quot;size&quot;? Why not use an argument
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or better yet, your code looks at it's input files and decides
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how much memory it needs to process them? Anyway, these are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most likely code bugs.
