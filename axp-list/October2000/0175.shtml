<EM>&gt; There's a patch in the axp-list archive. I have this problem on a few % of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my XP1000s. I thought the patch had gone into the kernel, but...
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm...  I rummaged around, finally figured out what my password was,
<BR>
and found a reference to a patch back in January.  The poster quoted
<BR>
the patch and asked if it had been integrated yet.  The patch just added
<BR>
one line that poked a register and a comment about preventing the
<BR>
drive from &quot;going to sleep.&quot;  
<BR>
<P>I applied that patch, rebuilt my kernel, fumbled the install so 
<BR>
badly that I had to use a jumpstart CD to recover, and eventually
<BR>
got to a point where the new kernel was bootable.  I still get a
<BR>
&quot;no such device&quot; error when I open /dev/fd0 and the kernel still
<BR>
reports that it has found no floppy controllers during boot.
<BR>
<P>Is it possible that you're thinking of a different patch than the
<BR>
one I found?  I'm running the stock 2.2.14 kernel from RedHat 6.2.
<BR>
If this patch made it into a kernel, would it have been some more
<BR>
recent one?  I guess I'll try upgrading to the 2.2.16 kernel.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for the patch suggestion.  Any further ideas will be welcomed.
