<P>
I forgot to mention the following stuff . . .
<BR>
<P>One irritation of using kicker:  I doesn't get all of the running apps.  Most
<BR>
running apps never show up in the taskbar as icons.  You can still get to them
<BR>
(minimized or not) using [alt] [tab].  Which is how I've always did it anyway,
<BR>
so I forgot to mention that bug.
<BR>
<P>kdvi isn't in the kdegraphics rpm because I couldn't get it to compile (it was
<BR>
complaining about an xdvi call).
<BR>
<P>With kmail not working, I'm still using the patched kmail from the kde 1.2.x
<BR>
series.  If anyone is interested I'll see if I can compile a static version
<BR>
until the kmail for kde2 gets fixed.  
<BR>
<P>Now that kde2 finally at least runs so Alpha users can pound on it and find all
<BR>
the nice 64bit bugs.
<BR>
<P>Kword and Kspread are really fun.  The math formula editor is a little weird in
<BR>
how it integrates into a paper.  Other than that they seem to do what 90% of
<BR>
people woud need out of them.  My question is how they got all of that into
<BR>
6.3Meg compressed.  What is OpenOffice? (isn't it 400Meg+ to compile?)
<BR>
<P>kmediaplayer is an mp3/wav/etc player that uses gqmpeg skins.  Pretty cool
<BR>
stuff.  You know if I do get Uncle George's jdk to work with kde2 then kde2
<BR>
alone ships with more stuff in it than AlphaNT users had (well . . . IF kmail
<BR>
would ever stay 64bit clean and I had compiled kdevelop).  And that doesn't even
<BR>
count all the other applications available.
