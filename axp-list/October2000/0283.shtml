<P><EM>&gt; A few small segments of the marketplace have been into 64-bit computing for a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; while now--mostly for large-scale, highly-specialized applications.  Over the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; next couple of years, however, we are likely to see the mainstream begin to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; move to 64-bits as well (with the introduction of ia64)--that is, an ISA fully 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compatible with the majority of current applications but transitioning to a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; new paradigm of computing.  My view is that competing 64-bit technologies 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (alpha, sun, sgi, etc.) already have the edge on any upcoming technology, but 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they are not positioned to take advantage of the mainstream.  That is, these 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; next several years will provide a unique opportunity for already established 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 64-bit technologies to branch out and take advantage of the rookie ia64 bids.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How is Alpha prepared to address the mainstream in the next several years?  If 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people are going to upgrade their computers, how can we make it more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advantageous to get an Alpha than an itanium?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even the low-cost variants, like UPxx00, are still very expensive for the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; majority of computer owners.  In fact, the majority of people don't even buy 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the fastest computer available; there's an entire market segment devoted to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the &quot;entry-level&quot; machine.  In order to address current 64-bit computing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technologies' lack of volume, don't we have to appeal to the majority?  Maybe 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we are retiring good technologies (LX,SX,etc.), in favor of the latest and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; greatest, too fast to be able to appeal to the majority.  Or are we content to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just appeal to the high end?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It seems to me that we need to provide solutions for more than just the high 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; end.  The business sector is seeking to meet a specific set of requirements 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for general office computing; the home computing market is seeking to meet yet 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; another set of requirements.  No current 64-bit technology seems to address 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all of these, and none are in the same price range as x86 variants.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In addition to competitive pricing, there should be other incentives to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; switching platforms.  As an example, Sun has the SunPCi add-on which 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;seamlessly&quot; (according to them) integrates Windows programs into the Solaris 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operating environment.  We don't have anything like that for Alpha, do we?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I brought up these points in an attempt to foster good discussion on salient 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; issues.  These are the questions that have been running around my head for a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; while now.  Comments are welcome.

<P>If you think the &quot;UPxx00&quot; are expensive, wait until you see InHell's
<BR>
price tag on their IA64!!! I guarantee it will be much, much more!
