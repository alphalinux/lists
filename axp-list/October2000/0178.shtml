<P>
I guess this is probably a bit off topic, but having seen two &quot;what is a fair price for ...&quot;  posts, and remembering back to the Athlon/Alpha price dispute last month, I guess that deep down the issue of the price of Alpha Systems is important to maybe the majority of the list. One of the reasons some people turn to Linux in the first place is cost - I for one could never have afforded a $2000 OS. (which is what DU was at the time I bought my 164). That's why I don't feel too guilty about posting here. Because we've chosen RedHat, we've shown we're interested in, amongst other things, value for money.
<BR>
<P>The PC world is lucky. There are dozens of &quot;price comparison&quot; portals prepared to put potential buyers in touch with hundreds or even thousands of vendors. However, we're not so lucky.
<BR>
<P>I personally want to know what the &quot;going rate&quot; is for various system types, be they new or second hand. I'd like a portal to tell me if I can get a second hand 164/533 system for 5000FIM, or a new 264/677 system for 18000FIM, or whatever. The thing that surprises me most is that I _want_ to be sent commercial e-mails updating me of new lower prices (I usually hate receiving e-mail from people who want to sell things).
<BR>
<P>I appreciate that axp-list@redhat is an inappropriate place for these updates to be sent, but where is best? How can I keep my ear to the new and second hand markets? 
<BR>
Even if someone could compile (and maintain) a list of links for vendors of new &amp; reconditioned Alphas, that would be useful for me.

<P>Judge Lewis Kaplan's idiocy finally proved August 17, 2000:
<BR>
&quot;Defendants, on the other hand, are adherents of a movement
<BR>
that believes that information should be available without
<BR>
charge to anyone clever enough to break into the computer
<BR>
systems or data storage media in which it is located.&quot;
