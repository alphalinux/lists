Hi,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You might want to get another VGA nevertheless - its the easiest solution,</i><br>
<i>&gt; especially since you get working VCs that way which is a big plus during</i><br>
<i>&gt; installation.</i><br>
Yes, of course I'd be happy to have a working VGA in the system, but I really<br>
tried a lot of things and it didn't help :-/<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Some time ago, I tested soem VGA vards, and all simple ISA VGA cards I</i><br>
<i>&gt; checked worked wine in the Jensen.</i><br>
During my first tests I tried all VGA cards I could find, among these Tseng,<br>
Paradise, OAK, Trident and the Diamond stealth. All except for the Diamond <br>
didn't even send a sync to the screen, the Diamond sends a sync but a black<br>
screen. And some of the cards were really old, I even tried 8 bit cards...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; able to borrow a card from an old PC with good chances that it works.</i><br>
But obviously not good enough :-/ Could there be an error in the EISA<br>
setup? Do I have to set up the card somewhere? For some reason I can't do<br>
very much with the EISA setup tool, as it wants a "System Configuration<br>
Disc" when I add or remove a card, and just won't proceed without this<br>
disc (I tried to use the EISA setup disc, but it doesn't accept it). But<br>
I was told that I don't have to set up an ISA graphics card in the EISA<br>
setup, so I have no idea what else could I do to get a working VGA setup...<br>
<p>
Cul8er, r@y<br>
