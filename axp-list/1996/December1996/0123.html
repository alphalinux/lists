OK here  is the scoop, I've done it, with both Linux and NT 4.0 and I can<br>
tell you the following.<br>
<p>
1.  You need to go out and buy a new cartridge.  This is because<br>
    You cannot remove the write protect from the cartridge that comes<br>
    with the JAZZ Drive.  (No matter what Iomega says, or alludes to)<br>
<p>
2.  Save the receipt, return the original cartridge and say that it was a<br>
    gift, and was the wrong size cartridge type (whatever).  Get your<br>
    money back, and you now have a free pre formatted Cartridge!!<br>
<p>
3.  Win NT automatically recgonises the drive when you boot (turn the<br>
    drive on before the computer!)and you can write to it, use it, knock<br>
    your self out.  This is also the only way to use a JAZZ with Linux<br>
    also.<br>
<p>
4.  Mount the drive as SDB with an msdos file system, for example<br>
    On my fathers system i used the following command.<br>
<p>
    mount -t msdos /dev/sdb1 /mnt/jazz<br>
<p>
    NOTE : I had already created the directory /mnt/jazz<br>
<p>
5.  Just remember all the usual stuff when dealing with a scsi device,<br>
    make sure it uses it's own unique device number (mine is set to 3)<br>
    An make sure that the last device in the chain is properly terminated.<br>
    The jazz drive autodetect terminator scheme has worked well in the <br>
    Configurations I have used.<br>
<p>
NOW ON A MORE IMPORTANT NOTE :<br>
<p>
I can vouch for the in-effectiveness, slowness, and basic stupidity of the<br>
technical support offered by I-Omega (that you PAY for).  When I ran into<br>
this problem I called EVERY day for 7 STRAIGHT DAYS.  Got a lot of WRONG<br>
answers, a lot of I don't knows, and finally they said I had a deffective<br>
drive.  It took them another 5 days to fax me back a RA number, which<br>
really didn't matter by that time, because I sent it back to<br>
Microwarehouse where I got it and got my replacement by mail before I got <br>
an RA number!! (I have to admit ONE person was of the same opinion as I as<br>
to the problem on day 4, and offered to help by sending a IBM<br>
preformatted cartridge, but this idea was nixed by a supervisor)<br>
<p>
I figured the problem out myself, and the problem is that they do have a<br>
program that runs under NT4.0 or with the alpha archetecture that allows <br>
the drive to be "reclaimed" (ie remove the write protect and allow a<br>
format of the mac part of the disk) If they do, they don't know about it,<br>
or how to use it.<br>
<p>
The product has been running great, it is fast and so far (2 weeks of<br>
heavy use) is reliable.  I cannot say the same for I-Omega Tech support.<br>
<p>
(please excuse the mis spelling as I am in the middle of crunch time, but<br>
decided to rip this letter off, to save some soul the hours of flustration<br>
I have already gone through.)<br>
<p>
BTW ( love it for backing up my linux partitions, has allowed me to use<br>
one UDB's HD to get another one running that had it's hard drive<br>
WIPED!! got to love tar files ;)<br>
