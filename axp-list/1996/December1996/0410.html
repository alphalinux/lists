Hi,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	10.4 Can Linux/Alpha Run Without Graphics Card?</i><br>
Oh, I really should have seen this :-( Sorry...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately, I have no idea who got those patches...</i><br>
Ok, as far as I followed the discussion you meanwhile got them :) So my next<br>
attack :) on you: could you compile a 2.x kernel for me? I'm a bit unsure how<br>
complicated it would be to build such an kernel on an i386 Linux, but I<br>
think I at least would have to build a cross-compiling gcc...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It would be the easiest thing for you to get an VGA which works to</i><br>
<i>&gt; install that thing.</i><br>
Hm, of course I'm interesting in finding such a VGA, but the problem is:<br>
the Diamond stealth is not damaged, it works well in my Intel machines. And<br>
it's also not incompatible to the Alpha, as it worked in it before some silly<br>
tool destroyed something in the setup. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I grabbed myself a Wyse terminal yesterday, and once I got the null</i><br>
<i>&gt; modem cable, I'll see if it's possible to write a small driver for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; console. But I can't promise it'll be available soon. </i><br>
Hm, thanx a lot for the offer! :) But I thing applying the patches could<br>
be easier. The only problem that currently comes to my mind: I have been<br>
warned that I would have to do some steps of the installation (mounting <br>
the swap-volume and so on) on my own on the ALT-F2 console, and that of course<br>
won't be possible using the serial terminal. Is it really neccessary to do<br>
these steps or does the RedHat 4 installation run through without such <br>
tricks?<br>
<p>
Thanx &amp; CUl8er, r@y<br>
