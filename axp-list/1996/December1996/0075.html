This isn't a Linux-on-Alpha question, as my Alpha just arrived today, but <br>
I'm hoping I can get some help anyway.<br>
<p>
I just purchased a 166MHz Universal Desktop Box, with no memory or hard <br>
disk.  I have RedHat Linux.  I picked up 32 meg of memory and a 2G SCSI <br>
disk and am ready to install and get hopefully get the puppy running this <br>
week.<br>
<p>
The box, however, came with almost no technical information, which was <br>
kind of a surprise.  All I really have is instructions from the vendor on <br>
loading Linux.  So I have some various questions.<br>
<p>
1. my 32Meg is in the form of two SIMMs.  Is there any requirement on <br>
using, for example, the left or right pair of SIMM slots?<br>
<p>
2. D I have to worry about any jumper settings, whether for the memory or <br>
anything else?  If so, what?<br>
<p>
3. Should I even _think_ about getting my 3.5" SCSI disk installed in the<br>
bay, or should I resign myself to running with an external drive only?  I<br>
think I read on one of the newsgroups that the power supply was sufficient<br>
for the board itself, but not for an added disk.  Is this so?  Finally, I<br>
note that the power connectors seem to be of a different type than I'm<br>
accustomed to seeing.  I would need to Y-connect off of one of these, I<br>
guess, and add an extender or adaptor with one end being this same type of<br>
connector and another being the standard connector that powers the disk. <br>
Are such connectors (the Y and the adaptor) standard equipment, or should <br>
I expect an arcane search?<br>
<p>
4. Most importantly, I guess, is there a source for tech info on the <br>
board?  I can't find anything on digital's web site.  If it helps, the <br>
numbers "5422555" and "5022554-01 D1" are stenciled on the board.<br>
<p>
I hope this wasn't too much or too off-topic for this list.  I look <br>
forward to more substantive contributions once I'm up and running.<br>
