Hi All. Now that I have my UDB Alpha running (more or less) it's time to<br>
start asking semi-intelligent questions... I don't know if there are any<br>
alpha kernel developers on this list, but here goes anyway...<br>
<p>
Apologies for the length of this post, but I am trying to be clear and<br>
unambiguous.<br>
<p>
I have read about the noname board, and the info I have seen tells me that<br>
the memory timings can be controlled via software and the GTR (global<br>
timing register) and various MCR's (memory control registers). Can this be<br>
done from the Linux kernel while it is running, or from MILO before the<br>
kernel starts?<br>
<p>
I have benchmarked the memory system on my UDB and it is, well, not very<br>
good. I have seen this low performance on intel machines straight from the<br>
supplier, and I always manipulate the memory settings in the BIOS until I<br>
find the fastest setup which works reliably - sometimes _MUCH_ faster than<br>
as supplied. I would like to be able to "tune" this alpha in the same way,<br>
and from what I see in the documentation I found on gatekeeper it looks as<br>
though it is possible to tune it with high precision.<br>
<p>
I had a look through the source to both MILO and the kernel, and couldn't<br>
spot anywhere in there which manipulated these registers, so I speculate<br>
that this setup is done in the firmware at boot time, probably at the same<br>
time as the memory is located and sized.<br>
<p>
I am seeing main memory access times (1st &amp; 2nd level cache miss) of<br>
500ns - 1us (amazingly slow). For your information, here is the memory<br>
speed chart from my memory tester:<br>
<p>
On this machine, one word = 8 bytes<br>
Reported access times are in nS per word.<br>
<p>

<p>
I understand some of the slowness - the memory system on this board is<br>
done on the cheap and is not as fast as some other models - but I can't<br>
help thinking that we can do a _lot_ better than this. Some of the really<br>
bad numbers are probably from TLB misses as well (I have been told that a<br>
TLB miss is really expensive on the 21064, but I don't know why).<br>
<p>
Some of the numbers in this chart are understandable (19ns to 1st level<br>
cache = 3 clocks, 1st level cache is 8k) and some numbers make no sense to<br>
me as yet (why the sudden slowness at 128k ? the L2 cache is 256k in<br>
size...).<br>
<p>
I will continue to research this, but any kernel developer (ie someone who<br>
knows what they are doing inside the kernel, or inside MILO) who can<br>
assist is most welcome to share their wisdom with me. Making the memory<br>
system faster will make the machine as a whole faster, and is probably A<br>
Good Thing (tm).<br>
<p>
Regards, Anthony<br>
