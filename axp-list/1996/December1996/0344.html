<i>&gt; System:</i><br>
<i>&gt; RedHat 4.0</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2.0.18 kernel I built from good source code</i><br>
<i>&gt; UDB 166</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; For some strange reason when I try accessing my motorola bitsurfer pro at </i><br>
<i>&gt; 115200K my port totally freaks out. I've got sp_vhi set on that port but </i><br>
<i>&gt; I can't seem to get this resolved.</i><br>
<i>&gt; As long as I don't set my port speed above 57600 everything is ok. Then </i><br>
<i>&gt; when I make any kind of call to change the port speed it freaks out, in </i><br>
<i>&gt; fact I've even locked up the whole system a few times. Did I miss </i><br>
<i>&gt; something, I haven't had problems with the 2.0 kernels and serial ports </i><br>
<i>&gt; for a couple of versions now, I thought I liked 2.0.18 because it had </i><br>
<i>&gt; been pretty stable until this little problem. Any ideas appreciated.</i><br>
<p>
This has been brought up on the list a couple of times before (by me and<br>
others) and no one has yet come up with a reason for it (BTW, you're one<br>
of the lucky ones to run your port at 57600, I can't even pull THAT off -<br>
which is why I took my machine to work to be a Quake server, hehe).  This<br>
does not (reportedly) seem to be a problem with RedHat 3.0.3, which may be<br>
related to userland stuff or may be related to the different kernels used<br>
by the two distributions (assuming they are different - I don't have<br>
access to a 3.0.3 distribution).<br>
<p>
Does anyone know what version of the kernel 3.0.3 was using?<br>
