    The Tek has a 16" nice sharp Sony Trinitron screen. Its a Tek OEM job<br>
   and not multisync. 3 coax lines go in the back !. (RGB, Sync on Green).<br>
<p>
    I know some VGA cards can be coaxed to generate Sync on green but I then<br>
   have this problem that the screen is running out of spec untill X starts<br>
   and it could damage the screen.<br>
<p>
Since some people may have access to inexpensive Sync on Green<br>
monitors, (surplus DEC VR297 17" monitors were available around here<br>
for slightly above $200) I would point out that even if the video card<br>
is incapable of adding sync to green, it can be done by a $5 worth of<br>
Radio Shack parts (see below). <br>
<p>
I know that DEC's TGA can add SoG: what are the other cards that do it?<br>
<p>
The problem usually is that SoG monitors often are single frequency,<br>
so that the text mode during startup doesn't work. I guess a simple<br>
high-res text mode emulation could be written and linked into the kernel<br>
to fix such case...<br>

PS Notes on VGA-&gt;RGB conversion: (obtained from J. Jenkins)<br>
<p>
I use stadard 74HC 14pin DIP gates available from any<br>
electronics store. I use a 14pin DIP socket<br>
originally so that I could change gate types<br>
(OR/XOR/AND) easily. 74HC86 (XOR) works just<br>
great with the VR320 (im using it now can<br>
also use OR, dont understand why ??).<br>
<p>
The VN10KM is a small signal N channel enhancement <br>
mode mostfet also available from most electronics store.<br>
<p>
IF the video card you are using is a standard VGA output:<br>
(Im using a diamond stealth 64 VRAM)<br>
<p>
1: RED video<br>
2: Green video<br>
3: blue video<br>
4: monitor id bit 2<br>
5: Ground<br>
6: red return<br>
7: green return<br>
8: blue return<br>
9: NC<br>
10: sync return<br>
11: monitor id bit 0<br>
12: monitor id bit 1<br>
13: H sync<br>
14: V sync<br>
15: NC<br>
<p>
I join all the "returns" together with the ground<br>
on the small PCB and use that as a common ground<br>
for the RGB cable to the monitor. You can use <br>
separate if you want to but you should join the<br>
green return and sync returns together. I did<br>
find some small shadowing if I didn't group<br>
them all together.<br>
<p>
Just a note, when you set up your video card in Windows<br>
set it to 1280x1024x72|66 or whatever is closest<br>
I use a VR260 (1024x864) at 1027x768@66Hz (check with your manual<br>
DA or D4 are 72Hz) your VGA will not like this<br>
frequency so either disconnect it quickly<br>
or before you actually set the video card to this mode<br>
(i.e. put the OK as the active control in Windows and<br>
then connect the VR320 and hit return) My <br>
diamond setup gives me 10 seconds to do this adjustment<br>
When you exit you will probably have to select the <br>
1280x1024 mode with your old VGA connected again<br>
and from then on every time you start Windows you will<br>
be able to view it in "big" colour mode. Note the<br>
vr320 will not work in DOS mode as it is not a multisync<br>
monitor so all you see when you boot up is garbage<br>
until Windows starts, I put "win" in my autoexec.bat<br>
file. <br>
<p>
Note there is a danger here: <br>
i had set up the monitor and for soeme reasonm it <br>
did not work so I couldn't see what was going on:<br>
my ol VGA wouldn't work and the VR wouldn't work<br>
either so I had to find the cards .ini files and<br>
edit by hand to get back to useable video !!<br>
<p>
For FreeBSD/XF86 the lines are:<br>
#VR260 monitor is 70MHz 1024x864<br>
#VR320/319 monitor is 130MHz 1280x1024<br>
Modeline "1280x1024" 130.81 1280 1312 1472 1696 1024 1027 1030 1063 +hsync +vsync<br>
Modeline "1024x864" 69.2 1024 1040 1168 1272 864 864 867 904 +hsync +vsync<br>
<p>
The circuit to do this is as follows::<br>
<p>
Note.<br>
1: you may be dealing with 135MHz sqaure waves so there<br>
   are lots of high frequency stuff around; use good<br>
   RF practices.<br>
2: the coupling capacitors are a safeguard to start with<br>
   I dont use them cause they caused shadowing around<br>
   sharp colour changes (the ol RC effect).<br>
3: Use the XOR gate first as a test but you may need<br>
   other gates to actually get it working<br>
4: A CRO will be handy for final adjustment.<br>
5: Make the device is as close as possible<br>
   to the video outlet on the VGA card.<br>
6: Take the 5V from the PC power supply<br>
   inside the box. I just hooked one of the<br>
   spare connectors which I also use for an external<br>
   fan (pentiums being the heaters they are!). Make<br>
   sure (check it again!!) (and again!!!) you dont get <br>
   the 12V one!!<br>
7: You must use a VN10KM or other<br>
   SMALL SIGNAL<br>
   N CHANNEL<br>
   ENHANCEMENT MODE<br>
   MOSFET<br>
   others will not work !!!!!!!!<br>

 HSYNC, VSYNC and CSYNC are grounded with 47k carbon resisitors<br>
<p>
 GATE=LS or HC types, HC preferred.<br>
<p>
 OR:   for -ve logic sync and no hsync during vsync<br>
 NAND: for +ve logic sync and no hsync during vsync<br>
 XOR:  for -ve or +ve logic sync and hysnc during vsync<br>
<p>
 Capacitors are optional, I dont use them<br>
<p>
 use XOR gate with DEC monitors and as a first<br>
 shot with others, then OR gate then NAND gate.<br>
<p>
 Get a CRO an adjust porch levels to 0.3V and<br>
 0 level (sync level) to 0.0V<br>
