<i>&gt;&gt; I can't believe how many times I've been posting to this mailing list</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; already. I've had a few hints and tips about how to solve my</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; -oh-so-annoying-problem- with the DE-422 EISA network card. The end is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; nearby, I've been trying almost everything you could imagine.</i><br>
<i>&gt;[..]</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to realise Linux doesn't WANT to find my ethernet card. I don't know</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; what's wrong. The card should be supported.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;From what I read on this list, that card is supported by Linux, but is</i><br>
<i>&gt;(erroneously?) not included in the precompiled kernel by Red Hat. Thus</i><br>
<i>&gt;you need to compile your own kernel[1]! Maybe this hasn't been explicitly</i><br>
<i>&gt;stated yet, as most people here tend to assume that one who</i><br>
<i>&gt;experiences Linux/AXP has been working with Linux before.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I've been looking everywhere possible. I've seen so many web pages<br>
saying the card should be fully supported under Linux. Digital couldn't<br>
tell that, because they only support OSF/1 and VMS, but what I don't<br>
get, is that it seemed to work under OSF and VMS pretty well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; ***</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Installing modules to add the depca.o in the kernel (?) doesn't seem to</i><br>
<i>&gt;[..]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Personally I don't like modules. I recommend to include it within the</i><br>
<i>&gt;kernel. </i><br>
<p>
I don't like them either =) .. But I wish I could find the bloody files<br>
that are needed. Just knowing they EXIST would be pretty nice. If you<br>
get solutions all the time that need certain files that aren't part of<br>
your standard system (why not, I would say, been installing everything)<br>
it doesn't make you feel too happy.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; ***</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; The installation wasn't really successful, to my idea, because the 2nd</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; disk that needed to be inserted gave 4 errors. And after that it didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hm, try to put the images on clean, new, preformated disks, of a reputable</i><br>
<i>&gt;vendor. I had several times problems with this, with several OSs, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;I now only use boot disks once for each OS and version.</i><br>
<p>
I had a time I had about 5 pairs of root and boot disks. Preformatted,<br>
DOS formatted, Linux formatted, SUN formatted and another pair of disks<br>
that seemed to be working earlier... All of them had a problem with the<br>
2nd disk. And, to know I've been downloading that disk from the net... I<br>
can't say anything else that something like that SHOULD be on the cd.<br>
And it wasn't there, like MINLABEL and COPYBOOT.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; give any errors at all. But, the thing is that when you try to use "boot</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; -fl "i" dka0" (in my case), I get the query to insert file and/or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; argument. Then I chose for "- root=/dev/fd0 ramdisk=1440" which seemed</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to be working. But, when I tried to use "boot -fl install dka0" it</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; didn't question me and I got a different way of loading the ramdisk.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; (with &lt;5&gt;&lt;5&gt;&lt;5&gt; signs). </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Those are, as far as I recall, OK. That's probably some ESC-codes the</i><br>
<i>&gt;console doesn't handle at that stage.</i><br>
<p>
But isn't it awkward that the "INSTALL" option and the "i" option differ<br>
from eachother?<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; And when I tried the last option, it refused to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; load the 2nd disk (error: "disk seems to be absent or has been changed")</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and the option with 'INSTALL' didn't do that at all. Documents on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The "INSTALL" is used by the kernels by Jim Paradis. RedHat kernels,</i><br>
<i>&gt;to the best of my knowledge, do not understand this option. But if you</i><br>
<i>&gt;use the Aboot loader, and apparently you do, you don't need that. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;'INSTALL' option was a special one to imply the other's, as the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Jensen's console can only forward an option string with a maximum of 8</i><br>
<i>&gt;characters. In case you use a kernel by Jim, be sure to write </i><br>
<i>&gt;'boot -fl "INSTALL" dka0'. I once noticed  the '"' makes a difference,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but that might be dependent of the firmware version in use.</i><br>
<p>
I'm using firmware version 1.7 (probably VERY old).<br>
<p>
Handy to know Jensen can only handle a max. of 8 characters as an option<br>
string!<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; internet use different ways that can confuse you very easily. I'm afraid</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; some packages aren't installed correctly. Although I have chosen to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; install EVERY single thing. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The RedHat install needs the "boot" floppy, to copy a kernel from</i><br>
<i>&gt;it. It doesn't prompt for it, so insert it immediately after starting</i><br>
<i>&gt;the installation script! In case the floppy</i><br>
<p>
... in case the floppy...yes?<br>
<p>
Yes, but then it whines about not finding the right disk and it hangs.<br>
That happened to me too often. Perhaps that there's someone who's<br>
reading this has the right boot floppies, so that I can ftp them from<br>
his/her site?<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Is there a program (such as SuperProbe) that can scan my complete</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; hardware and see what kind of cards are in my system? My 2000 AXP 300</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; doesn't seem to like the fact I'm trying to run SuperProbe, because it</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; gives memory errors. On this list, someone posted something about that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; SuperProbe won't work on an Alpha. How can I test my stuff then? Is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; there any solution?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ahem, SuperProbe as I know it doesn't scan your complete hardware, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;just the graphics adapter! I ported it to the Jensen, but since only</i><br>
<i>&gt;S3 card's are supported on the Jensen with Linux yet, I didn't bother</i><br>
<i>&gt;to offer a binary, since the XF86_S3.jensen server can probe those on</i><br>
<i>&gt;its own. </i><br>
<p>
Ah, silly me. That's true, you only use SuperProbe to determine the<br>
settings of your video for XWindows... yep. I'm waiting for a SuperProbe<br>
to run under Alpha systems... perhaps something for RH 4.1? =)<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; PS. IF I'll find out how to solve things, I will write a full FAQ on it</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and post it. But, then I really need your assistance...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Great :-). One reason that there is so little knowledge about</i><br>
<i>&gt;bootstrapping the Jensen is, that once it is done, you never need</i><br>
<i>&gt;to redo it ;-). Upgrading is easy!</i><br>
<p>
Well, nice to know. If only I had the system fully operationale, then I<br>
would still write the FAQ and would post it... but it's still a<br>
challenge to achieve a system with NO problems at all. Well, a few<br>
then.. but not like I'm having them right now!!<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Good luck, </i><br>
<i>&gt;	Martin </i><br>

Thanks, I will try to recompile the kernel AGAIN. Last time I did it, it<br>
put the image some place I wasn't able to find it. Not even with find on<br>
a specific date. Weird huh? Am I losing my mind or is working on 'half'<br>
a computer not so splendid?<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;[1] Compiling a Kernel:</i><br>
<i>&gt;Install the appropriate kernel source RPM. 'cd /usr/src/linux; make</i><br>
<i>&gt;config'. Answer those question. Choose 'Jensen' as system type, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;say 'y'(es) to SRM support[2]. On most of the other options, the standard</i><br>
<i>&gt;answer is OK. Don't include any PCI stuff! Say yes to your network</i><br>
<i>&gt;adapter! At most of the questions, you get an explanation with '?'.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Then enter 'make clean; make depend; make boot'.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Copy the result '/usr/src/linux/arch/alpha/boot/vmlinux.gz' to</i><br>
<i>&gt;'/vmlinux.new.gz'. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;[2] Some kernels didn't ask for SRM support in conjunction with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Jensen. Others imply it. You might want to use newer sources. I use</i><br>
<i>&gt;version 2.0.19 right know. </i><br>

Thank you very much. I will keep you posted (with problems or solutions<br>
