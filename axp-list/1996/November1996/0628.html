<i>&gt;As for the performance of Craftworks Linux, I would not know...</i><br>
<i>&gt;You see, I ordered it from Craftworks soon after they released it </i><br>

<i>&gt;very pleasent and said that it would be at my house in the morning or early</i><br>
<i>&gt;afternoon.  Two days later, I called and inquired as to the whereabouts of my</i><br>
<i>&gt;operating system.  A sales associate informed me that they had been having</i><br>
<i>&gt;some problems with the production of the Alpha CDs.  She said that it would</i><br>
<i>&gt;definately be sent in two days.  I was starting to get a little anxious</i><br>
<i>&gt;about my business being held up for the past week, but no longer felt like</i><br>
<i>&gt;paying extra for next day service when I would not get the next day.  She</i><br>
<i>&gt;changed my order to be sent ground (what's another two days?).  Four days</i><br>
<i>&gt;later, I was expecting the box with eager anticipation.  Three more days </i><br>
<i>&gt;later, I was still expecting the box with eager anticipation.  I called.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The sales associate told me that Craftworks was not sending any out at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;current time. "The only thing I can do is have a representative call you</i><br>
<i>&gt;when we ship it to you.", she said.  I reluctantly said alright.  I waited</i><br>
<i>&gt;another week (meanwhile running a _BETA_ NT ARGHHHH!) They finally called!</i><br>
<i>&gt;I was so happy.I asked if there was any way that they could send it out next</i><br>
<i>&gt;day air at no extra charge since I had been waiting so long.  The sales rep</i><br>
<i>&gt;said that he was not authorized to do that and if I was dissatisfied, I could</i><br>
<i>&gt;still cancel my order.  I said to go ahead and send it by ground.  He</i><br>
<i>&gt;cheerfully said that it would definately be going out Today! (Hooray!)</i><br>
<i>&gt;I waited five more days.  I called.  The sales rep said that Craftworks</i><br>
<i>&gt;was not sending any out at that time and the only thing she could do for me</i><br>
<i>&gt;was to have someone call when they were ready to ship.  I told her the whole</i><br>
<i>&gt;story.  I asked her what we could do to remedy my problem.  She told me that</i><br>
<i>&gt;she would be happy to cancel my order and credit back my Mastercard.  I said I</i><br>
<i>&gt;still wanted the CD.  She said she would be happy to cancel my order.  "But I</i><br>
<i>&gt;still want the CD.", I said.  She stated that Red Hat also sold AXP Linux, she</i><br>
<i>&gt;suggested I call them.  She informed me that she was cancelling my order and</i><br>
<i>&gt;hung up on me.  I called back, was told that I would have to place my order</i><br>
<i>&gt;again, and that those people who had been waiting the longest would have to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;served first.  I said "Thank You Very much, you have been soooo helpful".  </i><br>
<i>&gt;She hung up.</i><br>
<i>&gt;-Anybody else have this problem?  I was so patient, and I still wanted to hurt</i><br>
<i>&gt;the people over there!</i><br>
<i>&gt;- I then called and ordered Red Hat 4.0.  I'm happy now.  End of story.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I would NOT recomend ordering from Craftworks if you want to keep your sanity.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Thanks!</i><br>

Same story, almost, as mine. Only difference is my order was placed with Redhat.<br>
Nowhere on the website does it tell one that Adaptec 2940UW SCSI controllers<br>
are not supported, you have to read the manual to find that out.Consequently<br>
I could not install the system.<br>
<p>
I registered the product and sent a request for tech. support 10/30/96.<br>
Response was "will be answered as soon as possible, probably in 4 to 5 days"<br>
I am still waiting!!<br>
<p>
Craftworks e-mailed me 11/12/96 that they are shipping their CD which does<br>
support 2940UW's and PC164's.<br>
They are having a special for Comdex.<br>
<p>
I'll try their CD and if IT works and Redhat don't bother to support their<br>
product they can have it back.<br>
