Ok, 2.1.7 is out there in ftp-land, and has the new clever exception handli=<br>
ng<br>
implementation done by Richard Henderson for both x86 and alpha (I think th=<br>
e<br>
idea was originally Ingo Molnars, but I could be mistaken, and Richard<br>
certainly took it to new heights of elegance). Anyway, the new stuff uses<br>
some clever linker tricks to essentially do zero-cost exception handling<br>
rather than having to waste precious instructions to update the per-task<br>
exception structure. Very nifty indeed.=20<br>
<p>
The interface is still exactly the same, only some low-level architecture-<br>
specific implementation details changed. It's all so clever that it's scary=<br>
.=20<br>
People interested in low-level scary stuff should take a look at the<br>
uaccess.h files for x86 or alpha, and be ready to spend some time just<br>
figuring out what it all does ;)<br>
<p>
Anyway, the new exceptions do have a down-side: the exception tables do not<br>
currently get exported from kernel loadable modules. This is not something<br>
fundamentally hard: it's just something that needs to be handled by the<br>
insmod &amp;co people, and which hasn't been done yet. Anybody who feels he can<br>
be useful in making insmod talk to the kernel about the exception tables<br>
(Bj=F6rn? Jacques?), please contact Richard &lt;<a href="mailto:rth@tamu.edu">rth@tamu.edu</a>&gt; about this.=20<br>
<p>
Note that the lack of exception data in modules does _not_ mean that module=<br>
s<br>
don't work. It only means that modules can't handle user space address<br>
exceptions, and thus can't recover gracefully from EFAULT errors. As such y=<br>
ou<br>
can still load and use the modules (assuming you have the other 2.1.x fixes<br>
for insmod module loading), but I'd suggest against it on any system with<br>
untrusted users that you expect to do nasty things just for fun.=20<br>
<p>
Apart from the new clever exceptions, the other changes in 2.1.7 are:<br>
 - baycom driver is a real network driver instead of a strange character=20<br>
   driver.<br>
 - soundmodem driver. You don't want to know what perversions people are=20<br>
   up to ;)  (If you _do_ want to know, read the docs)<br>
 - various drivers which had boo-boo's with the new exception code fixed=20<br>
   up (ie ftape/md/cdrom/eql should work again)<br>
 - isdn silly problems should be fixed<br>
 - scc driver update<br>
 - tulip driver multicast lists<br>
 - aha1740 should work again (virtual/physical address probs on x86,=20<br>
   funnily it worked on alpha)<br>
 - quota unmount bug should be fixed in 2.1.x too<br>
<p>
Anyway, I finally think the exception stuff is starting to be stable (apart<br>
from the issues on module loading), and I think I'll try to start integrati=<br>
ng<br>
some of the other patches in the next few weeks. So expect to start seeing<br>
ipv6/PPC/Sparc/m68k/ARM etc patches any week now (and my apologies to the<br>
developers of those things for being slow to react - you're all in my queue<br>
of things to handle, I've just been slow to get everything else cleared up)=<br>
