<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As I mentioned earlier both packages are GREAT and we support both.</i><br>
<p>
These sentiments are well deserved for the above mentioned individuals.<br>
They have spent their time and efforts in the furtherance of the general<br>
adoption<br>
of Alphas and Linux and should be acknowledged for that.<br>
<p>
I was contacted by a Digital sales representative, a while back, and<br>
encouraged to<br>
purchase an Alpha machine as a superior alternative to Intel hardware. With<br>
a faster<br>
machine and increasing native software available and the promise of 70%<br>
speed for<br>
MS software under FX!32, Digital assured me their product is the way to go!<br>
<p>
Similarly RedHat and Craftworks, amongst others, are promoting their products as<br>
working editions of Linux that will run on Digital machines.<br>
<p>
All these claims are obviously made in the name of selling product.<br>
<p>
I investigated the Alpha PC164 and decided that it did, indeed, have many<br>
advantages and at<br>
least one native program that I needed, albeit running under NT.<br>
FX!32 does work, not at 70% and not with a large number of programs but it<br>
is useful.<br>
Available native programs are usually twice the price of Intel counterparts.<br>
I am comfortable with my decision and believe Digital will continue to<br>
improve FX!32 and the software<br>
situation even if only not to be the next IBM.  <br>
<p>
Linux is a different kettle of fish.<br>
<p>
As I understand it; Linux is available for download from various sites,<br>
free, and for people<br>
who have the inclination and expertise to work with the software and make it<br>
run this is the method<br>
of choice.<br>
<p>
As an alternative for those of us without the time, inclination or ability<br>
to follow this path<br>
various companies offer to sell CDs that do not require the above mentioned<br>
expertise.<br>
These products are promoted as plug and play.<br>
<p>
My Alpha has a 2940UW installed, despite all the rhetoric to the contrary,<br>
this card is not a product<br>
from Mars but a widely accepted card being used in many machines that has<br>
been available for some time.<br>
My first choice was a BusLogic UW but Stephen told me this was not supported<br>
by Digital firmware.<br>
<p>
I spent the $99.00 plus $12.95 for five day overnight shipping and received<br>
the RedHat CD together<br>
with an outdated manual.<br>
This product does not work on my machine.<br>
<p>
I am told the hardware supported list "should" have been listed in the<br>
product listing, it was not.<br>
Tech. support have not responded to my request for support 10/30.<br>
Several offers to write drivers etc. have been received but nothing has<br>
materialized. To be honest<br>
even if it did I would probably not know how to employ them.<br>
Stephen Gaudet writes that 'his' version supports the 2940UW and PC164. Why<br>
doesn't RedHats.<br>
Stephen ships his machines with Linux installed. When I bought mine, from<br>
him, the 2940 stuff was not<br>
available.<br>
Craftworks say their product works with a 2940UW and PC164, Stephen says it<br>
doesn't.<br>
Redhat are investigating why my questions are as yet not answered.<br>
<p>
This is all fine and dandy but RedHat have $111.95 of my money. I have had a<br>
useless CD for 3 weeks.<br>
I am not a programmer, therefore, for me to make Linux run I need a product<br>
to be almost plug and play.<br>
I read somewhere that's what I was being sold!<br>
 <br>
So, when and from whom will I be able to purchase a CD of the Linux OS that<br>
I can put in my CD player<br>
and install using "normal" commands that will run on a PC164 with a 2940UW<br>
without patching this,<br>
deciphering that and generally becoming extremely frustrated  and PO'd?<br>
Or, should I just stick with NT and forget Linux and leave it in the<br>
university computer labs.<br>
Me and all the other people Linux Journal have been trying to recruit since<br>
issue 1.<br>
<p>
I would, respectfully, suggest that all vendors ensure their product works<br>
the way they advertise<br>
before they are marketed. Should this mean waiting a while, then so be it.<br>
We know Bill does that.<br>
But you ain't Bill yet.<br>
If you want Beta testers, say so. Give them copies of your product for<br>
testing, but don't expect your<br>
customers to pay for the privilege of developing your profits.<br>
At present you are doing a disservice both to the above (way above)<br>
mentioned people and your own companies.<br>
<p>
Sorry for the diatribe but all I've read so far, on this subject, is<br>
straight from the Redmond fables and<br>
should not be allowed to continue as if it were a normal practice. One<br>
perpetrator is quite enough!  <br>
If its free I can't bitch, but if I pay money for it then I am entitled to<br>
get what I am told I am buying.<br>
If the vendor chooses to ignore me then I see no reason not to make any<br>
future customers aware of problems.<br>
