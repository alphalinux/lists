<i>&gt; No, MILO does not use SRM PALcode. Only the Evaluation Board PALcode sets</i><br>
<i>&gt; are available as source, which is what the MILOs are built with. And yes,</i><br>
<i>&gt; those boxes that aren't EB's are run with modified EB PALcode, like AVANTI</i><br>
<i>&gt; and MIKASA.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The EB PALcodes are pretty simple, as they don't worry much about</i><br>
<i>&gt; interrupts, expecting the kernel to take care of finding the interrupt</i><br>
<i>&gt; summary registers and dispatching to the appropriate handler. See all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; grotty details in arch/alpha/kernel/irq.c.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When configured for running under SRM console and PALcode, the interrupt</i><br>
<i>&gt; handling of the kernel expects to be told *which* interrupt has occurred.</i><br>
<i>&gt; One can't, unfortunately, use the non-SRM interrupt handling routines, like</i><br>
<i>&gt; alcor_and_xlt_device_interrupt(), when running under SRM, as the interrupt</i><br>
<i>&gt; summary registers have been changed by the SRM PALcode when *it* decodes the</i><br>
<i>&gt; interrupt, and so will no longer indicate the appropriate state.  However,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the update_hw() routine needs to know all the grotty details about where the</i><br>
<i>&gt; interrupt registers are, under SRM as well as MILO, to properly manage the</i><br>
<i>&gt; interrupt mask.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Note that the AXPpci33 (NONAME) PALcode built into that MILO, actually</i><br>
<i>&gt; delivers interrupts the same way as SRM PALcode, so the same kernel will</i><br>
<i>&gt; run under MILO and SRM PALcodes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Someday, get Dave Rusling to explain why its beneficial to have the kernel</i><br>
<i>&gt; know all the interrupt details, as under the EB PALcode.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

OK, I'll rise to the bait.  Jay says it himself when he makes the point that even<br>
in the SRM case the kernel has to know an awful lot about the configuration of the<br>
interrupt handling/routing.<br>
<p>
Almost every AXP system produced so far has different interrupt handling and routing.<br>
Personally I think that several hardware designers should be taken out and shot for<br>
randomly reinventing interrupt handling.  There are a lot of grotty things about the<br>
general PC architecture but at least you can pretty much rely on a consistant aproach<br>
from one Intel box to another.  Take a look at /arch/i386/kernel/irq.c and compare that<br>
with /arch/alpha/kernel/irq.c and you'll see that the Alpha case is a lot more confusing.<br>
I would, in a better world, favour a bank of interrupt masks and registers at known I/O<br>
locations but even that does not help you with routing the PCI interrupts to those<br>
registers.  Again that differs from board to board, see /arch/alpha/kernel/bios32.c for<br>
details.<br>
<p>
So, for each AXP based system, there has to be software somewhere which understands how<br>
to set interrupts and how to figure out what caused interrupts.  This interrupt handling<br>
code cannot all live in the PALcode as it is 'architected' - you may note that Digital<br>
Unix running on the same boxes as Linux also has different kernels for the different<br>
boxes.  It has them for exactly the same reasons as Linux does - to route and handle <br>
interrupts.  This is despite having SRM PALcode which only helps with the interrupt<br>
delivery and is not freely redistributable.  In other words, we couldn't use the SRM<br>
PALcode with Linux and not use the SRM.<br>
<p>
I believe that the interrupt handling software should be in the kernel.   That way,<br>
it's all in one place and it's easier to write/debug/port/understand.  However, in<br>
the early days of AXP Linux we used to have multi-platform kernels by including<br>
all of the interrupt handling for each {CPU, support chipset} combination in a single<br>
kernel and using the HWRPB information set up by MILO to call the correct interrupt <br>
handler.  Maybe we should re-invent this mechanism.<br>
