It appears to me that it is NOT legal to<br>
run statically linked programs as described<br>
in this thread.<br>
Now I think I need more clarification.<br>
Could we have yet another authoritative<br>
statement from someone at DEC?<br>
<p>
I'm reposting a response I received some<br>
time back from Jon Hall about this subject.<br>
Jon's response follows Scott Manley's and<br>
Jim Paradis' notes here:<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; writing your own code is to build your program statically-linked on a</i><br>

Here is my question and response from Jon Hall:<br>
<p>
<a href="mailto:bob@bob.usuf2.usuhs.mil">bob@bob.usuf2.usuhs.mil</a> said:<br>
<i>&gt; Then to be perfectly clear, a package like Gaussian 94, STATICALLY </i><br>
<i>&gt; compiled on a licensed DEC Unix machine with the licensed optimized </i><br>
<i>&gt; DXML (BLAS) library can be run on a LINUX alpha with no DEC license?</i><br>
<p>
[Jon Hall replied:]<br>
<p>
To be perfectly clear, with the issue stated as above, the answer is<br>
no.<br>
<p>
There is a difference between compilation and linking.  The binaries<br>
which are created by taking the source code of a program and compiling<br>
them on<br>
a Digital UNIX system using a Digital compiler bear no royalty or<br>
licensing<br>
issues.  However when you link them (either statically or dynamically)<br>
to<br>
licensed libraries from a Digital UNIX system and the thread of<br>
execution<br>
of a CPU that is *not* licensed runs through them, then you are in<br>
violation<br>
of your license which you signed to get the code in the first place.<br>
<p>
Therefore, if you compile a program (but do not link it) on Digital UNIX<br>
using<br>
a Digital Compiler, and take the resultant objects to a Linux system,<br>
link it<br>
against Linux libraries and run it, you are o.k.  If you link in (either<br>
statically or dynamically, either locally or over NFS) any Digital<br>
libraries<br>
(i.e. royalty bearing code) which are licensed, you are not o.k.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Wouldn't you need a DEC Fortran runtime license of some kind?</i><br>
<p>
This depends on the license Terms and Conditions of the Fortran license<br>
(which<br>
I am not familiar with) but in any case it would only cover the code<br>
that came<br>
with the Fortran Runtime Libraries, which (in turn) typically use the<br>
underlying operating system libraries (which are royalty bearing).<br>
<p>
In the days when most Runtime licensing was conceived, there were two<br>
schools<br>
of thought:<br>
<p>
        o sell the compiler cheap, and make it up in runtime licenses<br>
        o sell the compiler high, and give the runtime licenses away<br>
<p>
Digital tended toward the latter, but gave little thought to having an<br>
unlicensed binary compatible platform running the bulk of the OS. <br>
Therefore<br>
the relationship between the "runtime libraries" and the "system<br>
libraries" were not spelled out, since it was assumed that the licensed<br>
system libraries would always be there on a licensed system.<br>
<p>
Over time there was a third school of thought, which was to price the<br>
compiler based on "simultaneous usage", or even "personal usage".  This<br>
allowed the cost of the compiler to drop for infrequent or personal use.<br>
<p>
Perhaps it is time for a fourth school of thought, that of showing<br>
people<br>
how to substitute the underlying libraries of an unlicensed operating<br>
system<br>
in a run-time environment.<br>
<p>
Of course there was also a fifth way of thought (that of GNU), but<br>
Digital did not tend in that direction.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Would I also need more than one user license if</i><br>
<i>&gt;I intended to have several simultaneous users?</i><br>
<p>
Again, the license typically only applies to the number of users of the<br>
COMPILER (i.e. we priced the individual simultaneous users and the<br>
personal<br>
user license low on a per-use basis).  The number of people using the<br>
output<br>
of the compiler (i.e. your compiled program) is typically not metered,<br>
(but<br>
you should check the licensing of the run time libraries).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, is there an OS dependence built in to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;DEC optimized BLAS that would effect its</i><br>
<i>&gt;performance on a LINUX machine?</i><br>
<p>
There could be.  Issues around mallocs, context switching, use of<br>
virtual<br>
memory, file opening/closing.  I am not familiar enough with the<br>
libraries<br>
to see how they use the underlying operating system features to say if<br>
the<br>
result would be positive, negative or neutral.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;DEC has done an outstanding job of optimizing </i><br>
<i>&gt;the Matrix routines.  For matrix intense calculations</i><br>
<i>&gt;this can make a huge difference.  You wouldn't want</i><br>
<i>&gt;to buy a 433 MHz Alpha board and not run an optimized</i><br>
<i>&gt;matrix multiply routine in Gaussian 94, would you?</i><br>
<p>
I take this as a compliment, and representing Digital,<br>
I thank you. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Would these optimizations be effective</i><br>
<i>&gt;enough running on an OEM Alpha board to justify the</i><br>
<i>&gt;expense and time involved in obtaining all of these DEC</i><br>
<i>&gt;licenses?</i><br>
<p>
Even though your question is still unanswered, you<br>
have formulated the parameters to obtain an answer.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The question here is how would you determine what</i><br>
<i>&gt;"class" of licenses to buy?  DEC Direct sent me</i><br>
<i>&gt;to 1-800-axp4vme and they sent me to Dan Kilgore.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm waiting for Dan to call me back.</i><br>
<p>
I will give Dan a call.  Perhaps working together<br>
we can clear up some of these issues.<br>
