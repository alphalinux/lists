<p>
Sad, but true for too many folks.  (BTW is 5-day overnight a special<br>
that they offer?  Kinda like the three year lifetime warranty?)  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This is all fine and dandy but RedHat have $111.95 of my money. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; have had a useless CD for 3 weeks.  I am not a programmer,</i><br>
<i>&gt; therefore, for me to make Linux run I need a product to be almost</i><br>
<i>&gt; plug and play.  I read somewhere that's what I was being sold!</i><br>
<p>
I'd assert that for GNU/Linux to be a truly competitive product to NT,<br>
in spite of the performance/cost advantages, it MUST be plug and play.<br>
I've had much better luck with Slackware in the forty or so<br>
installations I've done than RedHat.  I've been villified on several<br>
list for stating this fact and opining that RedHat isn't worthy of<br>
it's growing reputation.  To their credit, they are moving in the<br>
right direction and some components of the distribution are<br>
marvelously smooth.  Installation is not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So, when and from whom will I be able to purchase a CD of the Linux</i><br>
<i>&gt; OS that I can put in my CD player and install using "normal"</i><br>
<i>&gt; commands that will run on a PC164 with a 2940UW without patching</i><br>
<i>&gt; this, deciphering that and generally becoming extremely frustrated</i><br>
<i>&gt; and PO'd?  Or, should I just stick with NT and forget Linux and</i><br>
<i>&gt; leave it in the university computer labs.  Me and all the other</i><br>
<i>&gt; people Linux Journal have been trying to recruit since issue 1.</i><br>
<p>
Most of us using GNU/Linux want it to succees immediately.  That<br>
passion appears in the LJ and is starting to enter the mainstream<br>
media.  The key difference between it and NT is that NT will never,<br>
and can never be fixed.  But, even if my unrecognized prophesy were<br>
never uttered, it is clear from the trends in the market that NT is a<br>
failure as a server operating system.  When will GNU/Linux be ready?<br>
As soon as all of us who do this for free either a) receive a large<br>
sum of money to apply the high-cost polishing effort that MS can<br>
marshal, or b) get around to finding the problems and fixing them.<br>
The pace of progress on GNU/Linux has been fantastic.  In a couple of<br>
years, it has gone from a useful toy to a commercial grade os.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I would, respectfully, suggest that all vendors ensure their product</i><br>
<i>&gt; works the way they advertise before they are marketed. Should this</i><br>
<i>&gt; mean waiting a while, then so be it.  We know Bill does that.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt; you ain't Bill yet.  If you want Beta testers, say so. Give them</i><br>
<i>&gt; copies of your product for testing, but don't expect your customers</i><br>
<i>&gt; to pay for the privilege of developing your profits.  At present you</i><br>
<i>&gt; are doing a disservice both to the above (way above) mentioned</i><br>
<i>&gt; people and your own companies.</i><br>
<p>
I cannot agree enough with this.  Neither RH3.0.3 nor RH4.0 were<br>
tested adequately.  Both failed to install on my Alphas.  I do believe<br>
that the x86 version is more stable and tends to install more easily.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Sorry for the diatribe but all I've read so far, on this subject, is</i><br>
<i>&gt; straight from the Redmond fables and should not be allowed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; continue as if it were a normal practice. One perpetrator is quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; enough!  If its free I can't bitch, but if I pay money for it then I</i><br>
<i>&gt; am entitled to get what I am told I am buying.  If the vendor</i><br>
<i>&gt; chooses to ignore me then I see no reason not to make any future</i><br>
<i>&gt; customers aware of problems.</i><br>
<p>
It would be a shameful act of disrespect and hubris if they refuse to<br>
refund ALL of your money.<br>

I am very sorry that you have had these sorts of problems.  It<br>
detriments the whole community.  The reality is that we need to do the<br>
most difficult work right now, the work of delivering high-quality,<br>
free software to commercial market.<br>
<p>
I started (yet another) list to look into the administration problem.<br>
We're beginning with a survey of the existing solutions and plan to<br>
present a formal recommendation of how to solve the problem.  We may<br>
either endorse an existing project and help with the development, or<br>
we may choose to present a new design and develop some software to<br>
implement it.  The more heads involved, the better our perspective can<br>
be.<br>
