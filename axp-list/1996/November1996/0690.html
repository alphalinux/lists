All,<br>
<p>
I wrote:<br>
<i>&gt;Yesterday I finally put together my new hardware, and installed RedHat</i><br>
3.0.3 (using a PC164 &gt;kernel from 4.0, and apropriately new MILO/LinLoad:<br>
thanks to Wolfgang Dreyer). Only &gt;problem during install was, I had to do<br>
mke2fs from the second VC by hand.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So now I've got it running, but some problems/oddities are remaining.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;- the firmware clock had not updated the date this morning. Time seems to</i><br>
be OK though.<br>
<p>
This hasn't happened again, I guess I just set it up wrong on the first day.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;- MILO complains about not detecting the NVRAM. (I do not know if this is a</i><br>
problem)<br>
<p>
No it isn't.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;- Mouse: Firmware sees a serial mouse on COM2, which is correct. Kernel</i><br>
claims it sees a &gt;PS/2 mouse, which is not correct. In the XF86Config I set<br>
up the serial mouse, but it &gt;doesn't work: when I move it the pointer stays<br>
in place for a while (many seconds, maybe a &gt;minute) then suddenly jumps to<br>
a new position. I have tried replacing the mouse, but to no &gt;avail.<br>
<p>
This one was solved when I realised one of my older mice could double as a<br>
PS/2 device. Warning for other PC164/Durango buyers though: serial mice will<br>
not work.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;- Ethernet: I have an ACCTON NE2000-clone in one of the ISA slots, and the</i><br>
kernel should &gt;see it as "eth0: NE2000 found at 0x300, using IRQ 5." It<br>
does, but only occasionally (one &gt;time out of five or worse) The other times<br>
it says "NE*000 ethercard probe at 0x300: failed &gt;to detect IRQ line."<br>
<i>&gt;I have two of those cards, both work fine in the Pentium, both fail in the</i><br>
Alpha, so I &gt;guess there's nothing wrong with the card itself. <br>
<p>
Someone (Wolfgang Dreyer) suggested I get another card, and I guess I will.<br>
However, I'll just wait until I've got Win NT installed (linload + milo is<br>
not enough to fill a 1Gb partition anyway ;-)) and see if it has the same<br>
problem. If it does not, I might try a little hacking.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;- There are some other things that work sometimes, but more often do not:</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ctrl-Alt-Del or "shutdown -r now" may cycle through MILO and reboot, but</i><br>
usually hangs.<br>
<p>
This almost never hangs anymore, thanks to an even newer MILO.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"date" may show the right date, but usually does not. (even after setting</i><br>
CLOCKMODE="ARC") &gt;(it is consistent from boot to shutdown.)<br>
<p>
Solved by Jay Estabrook. Thanks.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;- Doing "time" will get the Elapsed time wrong. (I believe this one has</i><br>
been on the list &gt;before.)<br>
<p>
I've been promised that this one will be solved after upgrading to RedHat<br>
4.0. I will do so as soon as possible.<br>
<p>
Many thanks to all of you. Maybe, having my own system now, I may be able to<br>
help some of you some day.<br>
