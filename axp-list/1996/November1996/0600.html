<i>&gt; Would anyone care to comment on Red Hat vs Craftworks Linux</i><br>
<i>&gt; running on an DEC UDB (166MHz)?</i><br>
<p>
As for the performance of Craftworks Linux, I would not know...<br>
You see, I ordered it from Craftworks soon after they released it <br>
and had them send it next day air-- I thought.  I called the next day<br>
to confirm that he order would indeed be shipped.  Everyone there was <br>
very pleasent and said that it would be at my house in the morning or early<br>
afternoon.  Two days later, I called and inquired as to the whereabouts of my<br>
operating system.  A sales associate informed me that they had been having<br>
some problems with the production of the Alpha CDs.  She said that it would<br>
definately be sent in two days.  I was starting to get a little anxious<br>
about my business being held up for the past week, but no longer felt like<br>
paying extra for next day service when I would not get the next day.  She<br>
changed my order to be sent ground (what's another two days?).  Four days<br>
later, I was expecting the box with eager anticipation.  Three more days <br>
later, I was still expecting the box with eager anticipation.  I called.<br>
The sales associate told me that Craftworks was not sending any out at the<br>
current time. "The only thing I can do is have a representative call you<br>
when we ship it to you.", she said.  I reluctantly said alright.  I waited<br>
another week (meanwhile running a _BETA_ NT ARGHHHH!) They finally called!<br>
I was so happy.I asked if there was any way that they could send it out next<br>
day air at no extra charge since I had been waiting so long.  The sales rep<br>
said that he was not authorized to do that and if I was dissatisfied, I could<br>
still cancel my order.  I said to go ahead and send it by ground.  He<br>
cheerfully said that it would definately be going out Today! (Hooray!)<br>
I waited five more days.  I called.  The sales rep said that Craftworks<br>
was not sending any out at that time and the only thing she could do for me<br>
was to have someone call when they were ready to ship.  I told her the whole<br>
story.  I asked her what we could do to remedy my problem.  She told me that<br>
she would be happy to cancel my order and credit back my Mastercard.  I said I<br>
still wanted the CD.  She said she would be happy to cancel my order.  "But I<br>
still want the CD.", I said.  She stated that Red Hat also sold AXP Linux, she<br>
suggested I call them.  She informed me that she was cancelling my order and<br>
hung up on me.  I called back, was told that I would have to place my order<br>
again, and that those people who had been waiting the longest would have to be<br>
served first.  I said "Thank You Very much, you have been soooo helpful".  <br>
She hung up.<br>
-Anybody else have this problem?  I was so patient, and I still wanted to hurt<br>
the people over there!<br>
- I then called and ordered Red Hat 4.0.  I'm happy now.  End of story.<br>
I would NOT recomend ordering from Craftworks if you want to keep your sanity.<br>
<p>
Thanks!<br>
Jennifer<br>
