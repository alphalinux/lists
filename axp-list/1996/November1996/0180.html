<i>&gt; WNT runs using different PALcode callbacks, both privileged and unprivileged.</i><br>
<i>&gt; They are incompatible with Unix (Digital or Linux) just as OpenVMS's PALcode</i><br>
<i>&gt; is incompatible.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, my point was that perhaps a new version of PALcode could have a feature<br>
to intercept all PALcode calls from a specific process (priviledged or not),<br>
suspend that process, and pass info on that process to another process that<br>
would handle it.<br>
<p>
I haven't studied the architecture manual enough to be certain that this is<br>
possible, but casual reading doesn't indicate any obvious reason why it<br>
wouldn't be.  It would have the disadvantage that it would reduce the<br>
performance of all PALcode traps due to the need to test a mode bit.<br>
<p>
It would really be a shame if there was no way to do this on an Alpha, which<br>
seems otherwise to be the most elegant processor arcitecture yet.  Motorola <br>
processors have been capable of providing a full virtual machine since the<br>
introduction of the MC68010 in 1981, and that's a CISC architecture!  Designing<br>
a RISC architecture that can support a virtual machine should be trivial by<br>
comparison.  Minicomputers and mainframes offered this capability even earlier.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The real killer though is that WNT runs in a different addressing</i><br>
<i>&gt; mode (superpage and NOT KSEG) over which it overlays it's braindead memory</i><br>
<i>&gt; management scheme.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think that should actually be too difficult a problem.  WNT would<br>
*think* it was running privileged, and it would *think* that it was mucking<br>
with page tables, but in reality it would be running at user level in a Linux<br>
process.  The memory mamangement for WNT would be entirely simulated based on<br>
the host OS/PALcode's paging system (perhaps using mmap() calls).<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
Eric<br>
