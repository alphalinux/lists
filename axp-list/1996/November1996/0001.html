<i>&gt;&gt; I can't believe how many times I've been posting to this mailing list</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; already. I've had a few hints and tips about how to solve my</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; -oh-so-annoying-problem- with the DE-422 EISA network card. The end is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; nearby, I've been trying almost everything you could imagine.</i><br>
<i>&gt;[..]</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to realise Linux doesn't WANT to find my ethernet card. I don't know</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; what's wrong. The card should be supported.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;From what I read on this list, that card is supported by Linux, but is</i><br>
<i>&gt;(erroneously?) not included in the precompiled kernel by Red Hat. Thus</i><br>
<i>&gt;you need to compile your own kernel[1]! Maybe this hasn't been explicitly</i><br>
<i>&gt;stated yet, as most people here tend to assume that one who</i><br>
<i>&gt;experiences Linux/AXP has been working with Linux before.</i><br>
<p>
It should be working, yes... that's what most of the dec-sites and other<br>
FAQs tell me... but when I look in the 'make config' when I try to<br>
compile the kernel, I only see support for DE4x5... and that's not the<br>
one I have.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; ***</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Installing modules to add the depca.o in the kernel (?) doesn't seem to</i><br>
<i>&gt;[..]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Personally I don't like modules. I recommend to include it within the</i><br>
<i>&gt;kernel. </i><br>
<p>
I wish I COULD dislike them: when I try to install them from an rpm<br>
package, I can't do a thing with them... this is absolutely the weirdest<br>
thing ever happened to me... I don't think I get the idea of rpm<br>
packages?<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; ***</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; The installation wasn't really successful, to my idea, because the 2nd</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; disk that needed to be inserted gave 4 errors. And after that it didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hm, try to put the images on clean, new, preformated disks, of a reputable</i><br>
<i>&gt;vendor. I had several times problems with this, with several OSs, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;I now only use boot disks once for each OS and version.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but 5 sets of disks all failed. Doesn't that say a thing while 4 of<br>
the pairs were preformatted, formatted by Sun/Os, formatted by Linux,<br>
formatted by DOS... argghhh!! I just want to boot without having to use<br>
those floppy disks!!! (we don't live in prehistoric age anymore, do we?)<br>
<p>
Besides, VMS install is easy: just boot from cd and voila. Same for<br>
OSF/1. I know these are old, but Linux (my favorite) doesn't have that<br>
option..............<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; give any errors at all. But, the thing is that when you try to use "boot</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; -fl "i" dka0" (in my case), I get the query to insert file and/or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; argument. Then I chose for "- root=/dev/fd0 ramdisk=1440" which seemed</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to be working. But, when I tried to use "boot -fl install dka0" it</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; didn't question me and I got a different way of loading the ramdisk.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; (with &lt;5&gt;&lt;5&gt;&lt;5&gt; signs). </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Those are, as far as I recall, OK. That's probably some ESC-codes the</i><br>
<i>&gt;console doesn't handle at that stage.</i><br>
<p>
Hmm, but still I don't see why there isn't just ONE option... it all<br>
makes people so confused having to try all the defaults and other<br>
options that are available. Like "help" under UNIX: it's either<br>
&lt;command&gt; --help or &lt;command&gt; -h ... right? And that's become a<br>
standard.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; And when I tried the last option, it refused to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; load the 2nd disk (error: "disk seems to be absent or has been changed")</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and the option with 'INSTALL' didn't do that at all. Documents on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The "INSTALL" is used by the kernels by Jim Paradis. RedHat kernels,</i><br>
<i>&gt;to the best of my knowledge, do not understand this option. But if you</i><br>
<i>&gt;use the Aboot loader, and apparently you do, you don't need that. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;'INSTALL' option was a special one to imply the other's, as the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Jensen's console can only forward an option string with a maximum of 8</i><br>
<i>&gt;characters. In case you use a kernel by Jim, be sure to write </i><br>
<i>&gt;'boot -fl "INSTALL" dka0'. I once noticed  the '"' makes a difference,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but that might be dependent of the firmware version in use.</i><br>
<p>
I'm using firmware 1.7... but I don't think that has got to do anything<br>
with it.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; internet use different ways that can confuse you very easily. I'm afraid</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; some packages aren't installed correctly. Although I have chosen to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; install EVERY single thing. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The RedHat install needs the "boot" floppy, to copy a kernel from</i><br>
<i>&gt;it. It doesn't prompt for it, so insert it immediately after starting</i><br>
<i>&gt;the installation script! In case the floppy</i><br>
<p>
... in case the floppy... yes?<br>
<p>
The boot floppy is needed, but why does my system run ok then, while I<br>
had a few errors in the installation procedure? That's not my favorite<br>
thing. I would like to have no errors, as far as I'm concerned. I know<br>
that's not easy, but it should be a goal...<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Is there a program (such as SuperProbe) that can scan my complete</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; hardware and see what kind of cards are in my system? My 2000 AXP 300</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; doesn't seem to like the fact I'm trying to run SuperProbe, because it</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; gives memory errors. On this list, someone posted something about that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; SuperProbe won't work on an Alpha. How can I test my stuff then? Is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; there any solution?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ahem, SuperProbe as I know it doesn't scan your complete hardware, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;just the graphics adapter! I ported it to the Jensen, but since only</i><br>
<i>&gt;S3 card's are supported on the Jensen with Linux yet, I didn't bother</i><br>
<i>&gt;to offer a binary, since the XF86_S3.jensen server can probe those on</i><br>
<i>&gt;its own. </i><br>
<p>
*nod* ... That's true.. but how can I detect the rest of my hardware<br>
then? I hate to say it, but Windows 95 has got a better hardware<br>
detection system :-p ... No that wasn't serious. But what I'm trying to<br>
accomplish is a way to find out about all my hardware settings. Not by<br>
looking in the ECU of the Jensen or looking in the console prompt. No,<br>
under Linux. In the future it will be a must, I can already tell that.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; PS. IF I'll find out how to solve things, I will write a full FAQ on it</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and post it. But, then I really need your assistance...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Great :-). One reason that there is so little knowledge about</i><br>
<i>&gt;bootstrapping the Jensen is, that once it is done, you never need</i><br>
<i>&gt;to redo it ;-). Upgrading is easy!</i><br>
<p>
Hmm, installing isn't easy... I really wonder how upgrading will go...<br>
But, if things are running smoothly, I will make a really extended FAQ<br>
about everything I've been doing... (including hacing lunch, throwing<br>
aroung with hammers... kicking colleagues out of pure<br>
frustration........)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Good luck, </i><br>
<p>
I NEED it! - But haven't had it sofar....<br>
<i>&gt;	</i><br>
<i>&gt;	Martin </i><br>
<p>
Oh Martin, look at the following error I get after doing the "make boot"<br>
command:<br>
<p>
[net........<br>
net/network.a(ipx.o)(.lita+0x80): undefined reference to<br>
`dev_queue_xmit'<br>
net/network.a(ipx.o)(.lita+0xd8): undefined reference to `dev_get'<br>
[LOTS MORE]<br>
<p>
When I tried to do a make boot &gt; output, the most important error<br>
messages (see above) weren't included, but were written to console... so<br>
couldn't get those in here....<br>
<p>
I'm getting crazy... slowly... but surely....<br>
<p>
<p>
More help would be more than appreciated!<br>

<i>&gt;[1] Compiling a Kernel:</i><br>
<i>&gt;Install the appropriate kernel source RPM. 'cd /usr/src/linux; make</i><br>
<i>&gt;config'. Answer those question. Choose 'Jensen' as system type, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;say 'y'(es) to SRM support[2]. On most of the other options, the standard</i><br>
<i>&gt;answer is OK. Don't include any PCI stuff! Say yes to your network</i><br>
<i>&gt;adapter! At most of the questions, you get an explanation with '?'.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Then enter 'make clean; make depend; make boot'.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Copy the result '/usr/src/linux/arch/alpha/boot/vmlinux.gz' to</i><br>
<i>&gt;'/vmlinux.new.gz'. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;[2] Some kernels didn't ask for SRM support in conjunction with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Jensen. Others imply it. You might want to use newer sources. I use</i><br>
