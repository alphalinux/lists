Hi,<br>
<p>
I posted recently about my RH 4.0 installation problems on my eb164<br>
machine. Basically any large amount of disk activity would hang the<br>
machine completely. My machine consists of the following:<br>
<p>
333Mhz eb164 board<br>
128 Megs of ram<br>
2 Megs cache<br>
ncr 53c825 fast wide scsi controller<br>
Quantum XP34300 Gig fast wide scsi drive<br>
Diamond S3 video<br>
<p>
At first the machine would hang during mkswap. After reducing the swap<br>
size from 64 Megs to 32 Megs I would sometimes get through the the<br>
mke2fs step or less frequently to the first large package install.<br>
However the results were the same. Complete hang, no messages on any<br>
console. Not that console switching was working, I just tried everything<br>
I could. I was using Milo 2.0.18 with a matching kernel from the Redhat<br>
distribution (which I downloaded). I have the CD on order so I can try<br>
that too.<br>
<p>
I read somewhere on this list that you should use the version of milo<br>
that comes with Redhat or expect problems. I couldn't find milo anywhere<br>
on ftp.redhat.com. Not even in the distribution that I downloaded. Maybe<br>
I overlooked it but    find . -iname "*milo*"    didn't reveal anything.<br>
I ended up getting a different milo from DEC. Version numbers in the<br>
names or in the READ.ME would help a little. Upon booting it I found<br>
that it was 2.0.12. Since I didn't have any better ideas I gave it a<br>
shot. I was very surprised when it worked. At least until about 75% of<br>
the way through the nfs install. With renewed vigour I plugged my Jaz<br>
drive into the Alpha and successfully completed a hard drive partition<br>
install (ftp install failed miserably). I was happy, confused but happy.<br>
<p>
Things went fine for a while (Hours) it seemed but then I started<br>
getting (or perhaps just started to notice) kernel paging faults. <br>
<p>
i.e.  Unable to handle kernel paging request at f26539db2fa40d7a<br>
      Oops 0                                   (An actual address)<br>
      ...<br>
<p>
The Machine would survive some of these for a while but eventually die,<br>
though console switching still worked this time.<br>
<p>
I'm pretty sure that I don't have any hardware problems. RH 3.0.3 was<br>
running reliably for several months.<br>
<p>
Has any body else had problems with milo 2.0.18? Why does it matter<br>
which milo I use once the real kernel is running?<br>
<p>
Where can I get the latest milo binary for an eb164. I'd try building on<br>
myself but there's that chicken and egg thing.<br>
<p>
Do the milo and kernel versions have to match?<br>
<p>
Thanks in advance for any help.<br>
<p>
