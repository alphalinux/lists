I apologize in advance to all those reading this list who will not find this letter<br>
either interesting or appropriate.  However, I'm coming to the end of my tolerance<br>
for the atrocious "service" I've been receiving from REDHAT over the last <br>
6 weeks.<br>
<p>
Around the 15th of October, 1996, I CALLED the Redhat Sales office to order<br>
the ALPHA version of Redhat 4.0.  (E-mail via their webpage goes totally<br>
unanswered - even when it concerns money!  I've sent messages using their<br>
website e-mail link on and off since around the 15'th of september with not<br>
ONE response!)<br>
<p>
When the 6th of November came, and I had not received any mail from Redhat, I<br>
CALLED the sales office.  "Oh yes, we have the order right here, we must have<br>
forgotten to mail it out.  We'll take care of that right now." <br>
<p>
13th of November - nothing so I CALL Redhat again.  "What order, we don't have any order<br>
for you - other than the one you made in July."  Holding back some vitrol, I replaced the order.<br>
<p>
18 November, I CALL Redhat.  "What order, did you order something?"  (Whats<br>
going on!!  I'm gettin irate now). Replaced the order again.  <br>
<p>
25 November, called Redhad again.  "We THINK (?) the order was shipped on the<br>
22nd.  You should get it the 26 or 27th, but call tomorrow and I can <br>
give you a tracking number."  <br>
<p>
26 November, called Redhat again. "We still THINK the order was shipped the<br>
22nd.  Don't have the tracking numbers yet." <br>
<p>
Today, the 27th of November, the order arrived.    <br>
<p>
REDHAT, YOU  SENT ME THE INTEL VERSION!.  I ORDERED, AND REORDERED AND <br>
REORDERED THE ALPHA VERSION!!!<br>
<p>
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THIS INTEL VERSION?<br>
<p>
I CALL REDHAT TODAY... no one's home!<br>
<p>
REDHAT, ARE YOU THERE?<br>
<p>
YOU DIDN'T SEND ME WHAT I ORDERED!<br>
<p>
HOW DO I GET WHAT I ORDERED?<br>
<p>
WHAT IS GOING ON?<br>
<p>
The "we're swamped with orders" excuse is no longer acceptable to me.  You have screwed up<br>
BIG time on this.<br>
<p>
If there is anyone at Redhat would reads this list, and has the authority to cause something<br>
to happen, I'd appreciate a response - phone call would be even better - to tell me how<br>
I can get the ALPHA (thats ALPHA) version of Redhat 4.0.<br>
<p>
Your actions have caused the "10 people hear if someone doesn't like something, 1 person hears<br>
if someone likes something" adage to instantiate.<br>
<p>
Hello REDHAT?<br>
<p>
NOT a happy customer!<br>
