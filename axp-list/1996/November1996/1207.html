<i>&gt;  &gt; Holy cow: 9.1 MB /vmunix (THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A MICROKERNEL!!???)</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; If this is the price for a unified kernel, I am not sure it is a good idea</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; :^)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; While I wouldn't call myself a friend of Mach, in all fairness: DEC</i><br>
<i>&gt; Unix is based on Mach 2.5 which is _not_ a microkernel.  Mach 2.5</i><br>
<i>&gt; started to lay the foundation for a micro-kernel but the actual</i><br>
<i>&gt; microkernel was implemented only starting with Mach 3.0.</i><br>
<p>
The /vmunix on a Digital Unix (or most any unix system) is also not<br>
stripped (*).  Its still fairly large, but its not nearly 9M of actual code:<br>
<p>
scooter&gt; size /vmunix<br>
text    data    bss     dec     hex<br>
2611696 371504  431744  3414944 341ba0<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think a single kernel would be a good idea _provided_ that it would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be a configuration option.  Say, you could pick between "generic" and</i><br>
<i>&gt; one of the real platforms.  As long as picking a real platform will</i><br>
<i>&gt; give you a kernel as performant/optimized as the current kernels,</i><br>
<i>&gt; there is no reason not to do this (unfortunately the advent of the XL</i><br>
<i>&gt; has made this task a bit more onerous, but it shouldn't be that bad).</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps we could find a way so that you could specify which systems you<br>
wanted the kernel to run on.  That way you could get the equivalent of<br>
generic by including everything.  Perhaps the first step could be to make<br>
a kernel that could boot via either SRM or Milo.  I would not think that<br>
that would bloat the code very much, and that would eleminate the particularly<br>
annoying problem of having for example an Avanti kernel that won't work<br>
on your Avanti.<br>

(*) Does anyone know why?  I used to think it was so ps could find data<br>
structures in the kernel, but Linux used to have a kmem based ps and we<br>
did not have to have an unstripped kernel.  When I first started following<br>
linux development, the big controversy on alt.os.linux was whether it would<br>
bloat the kernel too much to have a system call for ps instead of just<br>
hacking through /dev/kmem.  Interesting how things progress.<br>
