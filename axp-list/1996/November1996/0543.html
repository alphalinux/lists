[ slow compiles on AXP ]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There are two killers that I know of:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   -- The bits that try to convert to conditional moves has a bad</i><br>
<i>&gt;   exponential worst case, that isn't really that uncommon in largish</i><br>
<i>&gt;   functions.  Some of you may remember an example posted here some</i><br>
<i>&gt;   months ago (extracted from the X server I believe) that took &gt; 20</i><br>
<i>&gt;   minutes to compile.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   -- Quite a bit of effort goes into figuring out how to load </i><br>
<i>&gt;   constants &gt; |32k|.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Aside from that, I'm pretty sure instruction scheduling is an O(n**2)</i><br>
<i>&gt; algorithm; I've not looked at the register allocation bits.</i><br>
<p>
I decided to look into this a little more, so I am compiling the kernel<br>
right now with a profiled cpp and cc1.  I am doing this under Digital Unix<br>
since I am most confortable with the profiler over there, but I see the<br>
same slow performance with the DU gcc that I do with linux'es, so I think<br>
the results will be valid.  Its been running about 6 hours now, but its<br>
about done (isn't profile code slooow).  I will convert the results to<br>
html and put them on the web in the morning.  If someone wants to help,<br>
it would be interesting to profile the compiling of the kernel on an<br>
intel based machine to see where the differences are.  I have never<br>
used the linux gprof to profile multiple executions of one program,<br>
but I just looked at the man page, and gprof has a -s switch which looks<br>
like it would allow for this.<br>
<p>
I looked at the results of the profile after it had finished a few files,<br>
and it does not look like its spending a teriffic amount of time in the<br>
optimizer.  It does spend a good bit in the parser, which I think is good<br>
because the parser is probably easier to optimize than the code generator.<br>
Anyway, I will have the results in the morning.  I have to fix a bug in<br>
my gprof output to html script now :-(<br>
