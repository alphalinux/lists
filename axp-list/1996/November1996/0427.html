I am going to include this entire message because it is SO relevant.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hi,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I posted recently about my RH 4.0 installation problems on my eb164</i><br>
<i>&gt; machine. Basically any large amount of disk activity would hang the</i><br>
<i>&gt; machine completely. My machine consists of the following:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 333Mhz eb164 board</i><br>
<i>&gt; 128 Megs of ram</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2 Megs cache</i><br>
<i>&gt; ncr 53c825 fast wide scsi controller</i><br>
<i>&gt; Quantum XP34300 Gig fast wide scsi drive</i><br>
<i>&gt; Diamond S3 video</i><br>
<p>
me: 300 mhz eb164<br>
128 MB RAM<br>
2 MB cache<br>
ncr 53c810 scsi <br>
2 x quantum XP 34300 fast scsi 2 (non-wide) <br>
trio s3 video<br>
<p>
1. I wonder if we have too much (?) RAM<br>
2. I wonder if our Atlas drives are incompatible with RedHat somehow<br>
3. I need help!  :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; At first the machine would hang during mkswap. After reducing the swap</i><br>
<i>&gt; size from 64 Megs to 32 Megs I would sometimes get through the the</i><br>
<i>&gt; mke2fs step or less frequently to the first large package install.</i><br>
<i>&gt; However the results were the same. Complete hang, no messages on any</i><br>
<i>&gt; console. Not that console switching was working, I just tried everything</i><br>
<i>&gt; I could. I was using Milo 2.0.18 with a matching kernel from the Redhat</i><br>
<i>&gt; distribution (which I downloaded). I have the CD on order so I can try</i><br>
<i>&gt; that too.</i><br>
<p>
Yep, everything except the part about having the CD on order, since I have<br>
recieved NO REPLY at all to my continued requests for help, I plan to give<br>
NOT A SINGLE PENNY to redhat ever again.<br>
<p>
first, (this is during 3.0.3 and 4.0 installs) mkswap fails.<br>
then, I test with a 40 MB file, you know, copy between partitions, drives, <br>
whatever.  unfortunately, the last time I did a test (which was a half hour ago)<br>
it resulted in a (get this) 'bus error', and then (this is even better) <br>
tcsh had a 'out of memory' error, and any virtual consoles sort of collapsed on <br>
themselves...  THEN, I got the old looping video bios to black repetition cycle<br>
when I manually rebooted...(this is instead of the SRM... unplugging the <br>
keyboard seems to clear this up.) THEN, when I booted milo, SRM explained that<br>
it was 'jumping to bootstrap code' then hung.  repeated attempts resulted in <br>
same.  this made me decide to reinstall. (why) with ARC+bootdisks, and it <br>
totally flaked. I got a kernel panic, followed by a bogus address, then a total<br>
hang (I'm quite used to the total hangs by now, thanks)   Grr.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I read somewhere on this list that you should use the version of milo</i><br>
<i>&gt; that comes with Redhat or expect problems. I couldn't find milo anywhere</i><br>
<i>&gt; on ftp.redhat.com. Not even in the distribution that I downloaded. Maybe</i><br>
<i>&gt; I overlooked it but    find . -iname "*milo*"    didn't reveal anything.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I ended up getting a different milo from DEC. Version numbers in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; names or in the READ.ME would help a little. Upon booting it I found</i><br>
<i>&gt; that it was 2.0.12. Since I didn't have any better ideas I gave it a</i><br>
<i>&gt; shot. I was very surprised when it worked. At least until about 75% of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the way through the nfs install. With renewed vigour I plugged my Jaz</i><br>
<i>&gt; drive into the Alpha and successfully completed a hard drive partition</i><br>
<i>&gt; install (ftp install failed miserably). I was happy, confused but happy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
and I have looked for the 'latest and greatest' MILO, only found 2.0.12.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Things went fine for a while (Hours) it seemed but then I started</i><br>
<i>&gt; getting (or perhaps just started to notice) kernel paging faults. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; i.e.  Unable to handle kernel paging request at f26539db2fa40d7a</i><br>
<i>&gt;       Oops 0                                   (An actual address)</i><br>
<i>&gt;       ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Machine would survive some of these for a while but eventually die,</i><br>
<i>&gt; though console switching still worked this time.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm pretty sure that I don't have any hardware problems. RH 3.0.3 was</i><br>
<i>&gt; running reliably for several months.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
hmm, this confuses me, as redhat 3.0.3 was brain-dead, as well, with all kinds<br>
of bogus addresses like the one above (f256539db2fa40d7a what the hell is this)<br>
resulting in me 'upgrading' to another flaked out redhat....<br>
<i>&gt; Has any body else had problems with milo 2.0.18? Why does it matter</i><br>
<i>&gt; which milo I use once the real kernel is running?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I guess that would be me, but I have heard that 2.0.18 should be quite stable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Where can I get the latest milo binary for an eb164. I'd try building on</i><br>
<i>&gt; myself but there's that chicken and egg thing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do the milo and kernel versions have to match?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Thanks in advance for any help.</i><br>
