<i>&gt;</i><br>
Lots, as in whatever you would care for. If you seek a quotation I would be<br>
glad to (privately) email it to you, discuss it on the telephone, or send<br>
you a fax.<br>
<p>
I will not be "polluting" this list with any commercial postings, just<br>
helping where I can in user support. As for "rants" I can only leave that to<br>
those who consider this list their commercial domain. And I only pointed out<br>
the obvious. <br>
I am certain that Steve builds fine Alpha machines for his customers, and<br>
supports them well. I am also certain that this list is for the support of<br>
Red Hat Linux distribution, and Linux Alpha users. I have read many postings<br>
by Mr. Gaudet and others here who were advertising clearouts on UDB's and<br>
other commercial postings. I made _ONE_ posting of a price for the EB164's<br>
that are being cleared out and was flamed by Steve and his customers heavily<br>
for it.<br>
I did not appreciate it, and will not apologise to you or anyone else for<br>
pointing out what is obvious.<br>
 With regards to G77 there were a heck of a lot of other people involved in<br>
the ongoing development of this, as well as Microways' NDP Fortran products.<br>
I am pleased to hear that DCG Systems was one of the contributors.<br>
As for Enorex, they are a new player in the Alpha market, have shown some<br>
attractive machines, and I can only recommend that someone actually<br>
considering purchasing a machine check with them as well as the other<br>
sources for pricing and other information. They seem very legitimate, have<br>
invested quite heavily in releasing their new products, and offer some<br>
unique aspects. Having the courage to pioneer new pricing and to force the<br>
rest of us to re-evaluate our pricing is just one of the "gutsy" moves they<br>
have made. This is a lot more respectable than posting things like " we will<br>
beat any price..." which sounds a lot like a furniture discounter on the radio.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
