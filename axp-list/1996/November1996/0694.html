Hello<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;We just received our copy of Craftworks.  And just so you know as</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;"delivered" it will not support PC164 nor the Adaptec 2940UW.  There are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;some problems involved and we will report them to Craftworks.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;However, we now have it running on a PC164-500Mhz with Adaptec 2940UW</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;running a UW 2Gb disk but there is some major work involved.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We received DCG's technician's phone call for technical support this am and </i><br>
<i>&gt;walked him through the necessary steps to reconfigure the system to the </i><br>
<i>&gt;PC164. DCG ordered an EB164 version of the distribution, so they needed to </i><br>
<i>&gt;do some minor work to install it on the PC164.  The Adaptec 2940UW is a </i><br>
<i>&gt;standard driver in all of our 2.0.23 kernels.  We have heard of some </i><br>
<i>&gt;possible problems with the Adaptec driver in the 2.0.23 kernel and will be </i><br>
<i>&gt;moving to the 2.0.25 as soon as our internal QA group finishes it's testing.</i><br>
<p>
I have to correct you here Nicole when you imply Bill didn't have the system<br>
running which he did.  However, without your milo, linload, source tree and<br>
kernel.  Bill used a custom one that he built 2.0.25, that not only will<br>
support your Craftworks package but Red Hat's 4.0 with Ultra Wide support.<br>
<p>
Nicole, is correct in saying Bill Nihan my tech called and had problems with<br>
the X server video portion because it didn't load.  Craftworks did in fact<br>
help get this going for us.  <br>
<p>
However, Bill loaded the system and made all the nessary changes to get it<br>
to load on his own without Craftwork's help. Now I'll admit Craftworks does<br>
not have a PC164 system to test on.  However, Red Hat does not have one either.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, we had to order EB164 version because you don't have a version<br>
for the PC164...yet.  Plus, Bill told Craftworks how we got this running.<br>
So please be fair on this and give credit where credit is do.<br>
<p>
Craftworks as do Red Hat put out a fine product.  However, I would like to<br>
see the correct people get the recognition they deserve, Jim Paradis(who<br>
started the Alpha port), Jay Estabrook, Andy Reibs, David Rusling, Rich<br>
Groton, David Mosberger-Tang, Erik Troan, Laurie Hunter, Jon "Maddog" Hall<br>
and others who have made this port successful and write the drivers that<br>
everyone uses.<br>
<p>
THESE are the people that made it happen. In addition, Red Hat deserves<br>
credit for taking on this port with Digital when no one else would.<br>
<p>
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you,<br>
thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you,<br>
thank you, thank you, thank you.<br>
<p>
I'd also like to point out that the Adaptec 2940UW driver was a combined<br>
effort of Jay Estabrook, David Mosberger and David Rusling. There are I'm<br>
sure more that helped but these are the key players.<br>
<p>
All those that now enjoy the rewards of larger than 2Gb disks on their Alpha<br>
systems can do so because of David Mosberger's patches and Jay Estabrook who<br>
did some early on testing.<br>
<p>
I owe Jay E. a dinner on this one!<br>
<p>
As I mentioned earlier both packages are GREAT and we support both.<br>
Furthermore, if you want to see both run in a side by side comparison on<br>
Alpha come see us at Comdex in the Sands booth S8218 running on a 500Mhz<br>
system with UltraWide support and QUAKE.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
<p>
Steve<br>
