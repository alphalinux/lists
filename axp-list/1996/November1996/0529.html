<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It seems that the AXP flavor of Linux is plagued by difficult compiles</i><br>
<i>&gt; compared to its Intel brother.</i><br>
<p>
I am not so sure to what degree this is true.  At least a degree of<br>
that in reality seems to be much smaller than some postings in this<br>
group would seem to indicate.  A significat portion is likely<br>
classifiable as an "operator error".<br>
<p>
A good example is provided by periodical posts "I cannot compile a new<br>
kernel"; usually without any details which would allow to give some<br>
reasonable advice.  There is one "gotcha" for novices.  One has type<br>
'make boot' instead of 'make zlilo' or 'make zImage' like README says.<br>
I do not think that this explicitely written anywhere, although<br>
undoubtly it should.  Personally I found that the first time by<br>
reading Makefiles - which is not an easy method with multilevel<br>
Makefiles as employed by kernel sources.  Other than that it is hard<br>
to see what may be a problem; especially if a "victim" uses supplied<br>
scripts for kernel patching instead of doing that "by-hand" when<br>
not sure how.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  - The basic differences between Intel and AXP Linux from a compiler</i><br>
<i>&gt;    point of view.</i><br>
<p>
This is an exciting topic for compiler hackers, but I do not think<br>
that are ANY basic differences here from a user point of view.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  - Differences in size of variables like "integers" in C etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    (warnings about casting integers to pointers etc)</i><br>
<p>
This is not a compiler issue per se.  C standard says only that short is<br>
no longer than int which is no longer than long.  It does not say which,<br>
if any, of these types is good enough to hold a pointer.  Unfortunately<br>
there is a log of a buggy code around which makes unwarranted assumptions<br>
"because it happens to work on my system".  Anybody who hacked Atari ST,<br>
Amiga (or even ported Unix software to MS-DOS) and later tried Digital<br>
Unix (a.k.a. OSF/1) is well aware about this for years.  I am afraid that<br>
if you have buggy code which you want to use, then you have to fix it.<br>
If you are getting warnings about conversions between pointers and<br>
integer types you should assume that without fixing these bugs be deadly.<br>
In any case, the code was broken as given, even if it happened to work<br>
somewhere.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  - Common compiler switches for quick fixes.</i><br>
<p>
"Quick fixes" do not fix anything.  The only switch in gcc which helps<br>
is '-Wall', plus possible few others warnings not covered by "all". :-)<br>
You just have to listen to what compiler says.  Adding prototypes, if<br>
absent, if often of a great help.  Flak from a compiler is good!<br>
A clean compile does not mean that a code is correct, but usually you<br>
are a long way to this goal at that point.<br>
<p>
If you are at the dead end then learing how to use -E switch, in order<br>
to look at a code as compiler *really* sees it, can be of some help.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  - Common library problems (overlaping and underlaping)</i><br>
<p>
Eh?  You mean misalignment?<br>
<p>
At last something which is really a compiler issue.  There is some chance<br>
that you may run into a bug in a compiler.  Probably bigger with axp<br>
variant of gcc than with Intel as the code is likely younger and used<br>
by a smaller group of people.  On the other hand, this compiler was used<br>
to compile quite sizeable working systems, like Linux, so it is not all<br>
that bad. :-)  Still that chance is real, both on Intel and AXP.<br>
