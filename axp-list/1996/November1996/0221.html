This problem has actually been going for quite some time, but not until my<br>
recent upgrades did it become serious. I *DESPERATELY* need to figure out<br>
what the hell is causing this.<br>
<p>
Background: UDB 166 MHz with 128 MB RAM. Originally had a 2 GB boot drive<br>
and two 4 GB drives in a RAID-0 setup (using md) as the news spool. New<br>
setup has a 4 GB boot drive and a 18 GB RAID-5 array connected to an<br>
Adaptec 2940U (not UW) in the PCI slot. The SIMMS are true parity 8 MB x<br>
36 bit SIMMs, 60 ns speed.<br>
<p>
Originally I ran kernel 2.0.18 (no axp-diffs), milo 2.0.12, and a beta of<br>
Colgate (late September...right before the final version). Now I'm running<br>
kernel 2.0.24, Milo 2.0.22 (from the test images directory), and the<br>
official Colgate plus the recently released update RPMs.<br>
<p>
Problem: originally, we'd get lots of correctable memory errors. Replacing<br>
SIMMs and motherboards did not cure the problem. The errors would only<br>
start popping up once inn was started, or when something else<br>
memory-intense started running (such as a drive check after a crash).<br>
<p>
On the new setup, everything ran perfectly until I started INN. Suddently<br>
the screen went bezerk with what looked like machine checks, though they<br>
went by so fast I couldn't read them. Eventually they stopped and the<br>
machine was frozen. Judging from the hex dumps they look like an "unknown<br>
errlog size 206" machine check.<br>
<p>
Upon reboot the system would eventually die the same way after it started<br>
checking the now dirty hard disk partitions.<br>
<p>
Moving SIMMs around did not help. Tried reseating, rearranging, even going<br>
down to 80 MB (2 x 32 plus 2 x 8). Also tried artificially forcing Linux<br>
down to less memory than was actually installed using a "mem=64M" command<br>
line option. Same result.<br>
<p>
Eventually I managed to boot the machine on just two 8 MB SIMMs.<br>
Apparently, for some reason or another, it seems like 32 MB SIMMs just<br>
_do_not_ work right in there. As I said, I've had both the SIMMs and<br>
motherboards replaced and nothing changed. The end conclusion is that I<br>
simply can't use ANY 32 MB SIMMs in this darn thing.<br>
<p>
Also I seem to recall that on the old setup, I was running ELF without<br>
axp-diffs because I had this same disasterous set of scrolling messages<br>
when I tried a kernel with axp-diffs. Back then I still had some ECOFF<br>
machines, so I compiled unpatched kernels as ECOFF and ran those. Now I<br>
_have_ to build ELF kernels, so I have to have the axp-diffs installed to<br>
compile. Also since I have the Adaptec installed I can't use any standard<br>
ready-built kernels. I should note that when I tried axp-diff kernels<br>
previously, I was running standard Milo 2.0.12 (no test images).<br>
<p>
The SRM console and ARC firmware see the memory just fine and never<br>
complain. I'm not an Alpha guru (especially not at the hardware<br>
level), but this makes me suspect that perhaps something in the PAL code<br>
and/or kernel is messing up the memory controller somehow.<br>
<p>
I'm also curious if this problem is the same problem that prevents me from<br>
running INN as an ELF binary (it gets a single unaligned access trap and<br>
just dies with other errors on the screen or in the logs). I've been<br>
running it as ECOFF for all this time, but if I have to recompile it for<br>
any reason it's going to end up ELF now, and that worries me.<br>
