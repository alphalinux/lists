hi-<br>
<p>
Does anybody know how to order spare parts for UDB's?<br>
<p>
The SCSI connector on the back of my UDB is defective. I called <br>
1-800-DIGITAL and told them the problem. They said I should be covered by <br>
the 90-day hardware warranty, but that I'd have to take it to their <br>
Servicenter to be looked at.<br>
<p>
I brought it in and showed them the problem, and they agreed that it was <br>
broke and that the int/ext SCSI cable needed to be replaced. Then the <br>
next day he called me and said he was having trouble locating the part. I <br>
explained that the model had been dicontinued, and that as far as I <br>
understood things, a few had been held back by Digital for spare parts. I <br>
told him I would try and track down someone at Digital who knew about this <br>
and have them call him.<br>
<p>
So I called DEC and somehow navigated my way through the phone maze to<br>
someone in Multia post-sales technical support who kindly explained to me <br>
that I needed to call 1-800-DIGITAL and ask for the PRE-sales tech <br>
support. When I did that though, the receptionist told me that Digital no <br>
longer did telephone tech support for the Multia and then reffered me to the <br>
web page: <br>
<p>
 <a href="http://www.digital.com/info/multia/">http://www.digital.com/info/multia/</a><br>
<p>
which is all about Multia software and how it's been superceded by new <br>
functionality in Windows NT 4.0. Not much use to me.<br>
<p>
I'd really like to get this part ordered before the warranty expires on <br>
Thursday. So if anyone knows with whom at Digital I need to speak, please <br>
let me know.<br>
<p>
Thanks in advance,<br>
