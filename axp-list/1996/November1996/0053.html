Hello Kernel Gurus,<br>
    I have found an inconsistency in the handling of NFS mounting<br>
directories over the top of other directories.  I am not sure if this shows<br>
up under Linux/x86 or not, but I found it on the alpha, so I am posting<br>
it here.  I am also not sure what the correct behavior is, but I am almost<br>
positive that I am not seeing it.<br>
<p>
    First some background.  I wanted to rebuild one of my companies products<br>
under Linux/Alpha.  All the files are on AFS, and since there is no AFS for<br>
Linux/Alpha (yet), I am using transarcs AFS to NFS translator, and the amd<br>
automounter.  My Linux distribution is Redhat 4.0.  One complicating factor<br>
is that because of the AFS-&gt;NFS translator, root can not look into the<br>
AFS tree, even though normal users can.<br>
<p>
    In order to be able to use the standard scripts to build the product,<br>
I needed to be able to write into the following directories:<br>
<p>
/afs/rtp/product/verification/build/arch/alpha-dec-linux2.0<br>
/afs/rtp/product/lib/build/arch/alpha-dec-linux2.0<br>
<p>
    Now the problem is that these directories do not exist.  The arch<br>
directories do exist though, and their path after the translator/automounter<br>
is:<br>
<p>
/.automounter/triton1/root/afs/rtp/product/verification/build/arch<br>
/.automounter/triton1/root/afs/rtp/product/lib/build/arch<br>
<p>
My solution was to create the directory /home/jlnance/arch/alpha-dec-linux2.0,<br>
and to export the arch directory via NFS and mount it on top of the arch<br>
directories in the automounter path.  So, as root I tried something like:<br>
<p>
archdir=/home/jlnance/arch<br>
autopth=/.automounter/triton1/root/afs/rtp/product<br>
mount -t nfs localhost:$archdir $autopath/verification/build/arch<br>
mount -t nfs localhost:$archdir $autopath/lib/build/arch<br>
<p>
Now when you execute these commands an interesting thing happens.  It gives<br>
2 warning messages.  The first says that the operation is not permitted,<br>
the second says that the mount was done read only.  It will mount the first<br>
directory, but not the second.  It is also impossible to unmount this<br>
directory.<br>
<p>
At this point I thought that perhaps it did not like mounting the same<br>
directory in 2 places, so I made /home/jlnance/arch2/alpha-dec-linux<br>
and tried to mount a different directory on each arch directory.  This<br>
made almost no difference.  One of the mounts works, the other one does<br>
not, and each command generates 2 warning message.  It is not possible to<br>
unmount the directory.<br>
<p>
I just realized that the automounter path I mounter over contains a symlink.<br>
I don't know if it matters, but /afs/rtp is a symlink to something like<br>
/afs/rtp.avanticorp.<br>
<p>
At this point I decided I did not know enough about what was supposed to<br>
happen to investigate much further.  I can repeat these experiments and<br>
take more detailed notes if anyone is interested.  I guess the first question<br>
that comes to my mind is whether it should have allowed me to mount<br>
both directories, or forbidden me to mount both of them.  Anyone know?<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
Jim<br>
