<i>&gt; Well, my spiffy new computer finally arrived and I am very pleased.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I do have a comment and some questions that have popped up</i><br>

<i>&gt; 64M ram, with the standard ncr53c810, #9 s3-964P, and dc21140 components.</i><br>
<p>
Very nice setup.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1) The 1.3.57 kernel that was distributed with RedHat 2.1 was almost </i><br>
<i>&gt; unusable.  I kept getting various kernel panics about every 5 minutes,</i><br>
<i>&gt; more or less randomly.  I managed to get up and running by doing a </i><br>
<i>&gt; minimum install, then repeatedly adding packages, syncing and panicing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Once up, I could upgrade to 1.3.76 which has been stable thus far.</i><br>
<p>
Indeed. The 21164 was not officially supported until something like the <br>
1.3.67 kernel, and there were some mm instability problems with the <br>
initial eb164 patches. With the current kernels it should be perfectly ok <br>
(I have not been able to trigger any 21164-specific problems any more)<br>
<p>
I hope the next RedHat alpha CD will have a newer kernel (and especially <br>
newer MILO/LINLOAD stuff), so that the eb164 will be not only "supported" <br>
but also easy to install ;-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2) While I was able to get a working XF86Config on a friend's i386</i><br>
<i>&gt; with more or less the same video setup, I've been unable to find the</i><br>
<i>&gt; right magic for my alpha.  The symptom is that the screen goes blank</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the computer, as far as I can tell, locks up.  Is there a known</i><br>
<i>&gt; gotcha here?  Does someone have a working XF86Config file for the </i><br>
<i>&gt; same video card they can send me?</i><br>
<p>
Did you get the eb164-specific X server?<br>
<p>
The X server maps the IO stuff in user space and accesses the video <br>
memory and IO ports directly, and the PCI bus is slightly different on <br>
the eb164 vs the "normal" 21064 PCI setup. So the normal X server seems <br>
to mess up by simply writing incorrect IO information.<br>
<p>
With the eb164 version of the X server it works, although for me it <br>
doesn't restore the screen correctly on exit (I haven't bothered to track <br>
this down, as the eb164 I have is only a temporary loaner, so I haven't <br>
actually wanted to get too attached to it ;-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3) Neither reboot not halt manage to correctly unmount the filesystems</i><br>
<i>&gt; before they lock the computer so that a fsck is always required on</i><br>
<i>&gt; bootup.  Is this a common problem, or something unique here?</i><br>
<p>
I haven't seen this one..<br>
