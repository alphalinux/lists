As promised, here's the first pass of my Jensen-HOWTO.  It's a bit rough<br>
around the edges, but my tech writer will get on it right away (Have at<br>
it, Charlie!).  There should be at least enough information contained herein<br>
to let you get started...<br>
<p>
    Installing Linux on the DEC 2000 AXP and the DECpc 150 AXP ("Jensen")<br>
<p>
The first PC-class Alpha systems produced by Digital were the "Jensen"<br>
series.  Two models were produced, which differed only in the bundled<br>
software.  The DECpc 150 AXP was bundled with Windows NT, while the<br>
DEC 2000 AXP was bundled with either OpenVMS or DEC OSF/1.  The Jensen<br>
was an EISA-based system with a 21064 Alpha processor running at 150MHz.<br>
<p>
With the introduction of higher-performance PCI-based systems, Digital<br>
discontinued manufacturing the Jensen.  Customers are replacing their<br>
Jensens with higher-performance systems.  With a number of Jensens<br>
appearing on the surplus market and in the back corners of laboratories<br>
and computer rooms, there has been considerable interest in running<br>
Linux on them.<br>
<p>
Jensen was the first target platform for the Linux/Alpha port, so running<br>
Linux on a Jensen is not a problem.  Installing Linux on a Jensen is another<br>
matter entirely, due to the following constraints:<br>
<p>
	- Linux requires either OSF PALcode or the MILO PALcode.<br>
<p>
	- Jensen is sufficiently different from the PCI-based systems<br>
	  that porting the MILO PALcode would be a significant<br>
	  undertaking.<br>
<p>
	- Jensen has OSF PALcode in its ROM, but it is only available<br>
	  within the SRM console.<br>
<p>
	- The SRM console firmware on Jensen cannot access the floppy<br>
	  drive -- only SCSI and network devices.<br>
<p>
	- The ARC console firmware on Jensen can access the floppy drive,<br>
	  but it uses a different PAL and cannot switch to the OSF PALcode.<br>
<p>
	- Jensen is no longer being produced by Digital, so there is<br>
	  little chance of getting a firmware upgrade such that the SRM<br>
	  console can access the floppy drive.<br>
<p>
	- "fdisk" style partition tables are incompatible with the SRM<br>
	  boot mechanism.  This means that Linux and NT cannot coexist<br>
	  on the same disk.<br>
<p>
	- The SRM firmware on Jensen has a limit of 8 characters of stored<br>
	  boot flags, or 16 characters on the command line.  This requires<br>
	  the ability to process abbreviated command lines.  The kernel<br>
	  that I provide understands one abbreviation: INSTALL.  This<br>
	  is exactly equivalent to: "root=/dev/fd0 load_ramdisk=1".  I<br>
	  will implement more in the future.<br>
<p>
Taken together, these constraints yield the following procedure for <br>
installing Linux on a Jensen:<br>
<p>
	- From the ARC console, partition the Linux device and install<br>
	  the bootable kernel.<br>
<p>
	- From the SRM console, boot the Linux kernel and complete the<br>
	  installation.<br>
<p>
The necessary files can be found in:<br>
	<br>
	ftp.digital.com:/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/JENSEN_INSTALL<br>
<p>
This directory contains the following:<br>
<p>
	arcutils/		Standalone ARC utilities<br>
<i>	   |</i><br>
	   +--minlabel.exe	Partitioning utility<br>
<i>	   |</i><br>
	   +--copyboot.exe	Utility for copying the bootdisk to the<br>
				hard drive<br>
<p>
	bootdisk.1.3.72.jensen.srm.gz	Boot disk for Jensen.  This is a<br>
					modified 1.3.72 kernel which you<br>
					must use for Jensen install.  Source<br>
					patches will be available in this<br>
					directory within a day or so...<br>
<p>
	pseudo-bootdisk.gz		ext2 disk which contains vmlinux.gz<br>
					version 1.3.72 for Jensen.  Not<br>
					usable in the current boot scheme,<br>
					but Red Hat requires it for install.<br>
<p>
This is the detailed procedure:<br>
<p>
Prepare your floppies:<br>
<p>
	- Create a DOS-formatted floppy with the standalone<br>
	  ARC utilities (MINLABEL.EXE and COPYBOOT.EXE)<br>
<p>
	- Uncompress the boot disk image and copy it to a floppy<br>
	  using dd (unix) or rawrite (DOS)<br>
<p>
	- If you are installing Red Hat, uncompress the pseudo-bootdisk<br>
	  image and copy it to a floppy using dd or rawrite.<br>
<p>
	- Create the ramdisk floppy image for your distribution.<br>
<p>
	- You will, of course, need the installation media for your <br>
	  OS distribution (CD or floppies)<br>
<p>
Installation procedure:<br>
<p>
	- Get to the ARC console opening screen.  If your Jensen <br>
	  comes up to the ARC console (it says "ARC" in the first<br>
	  line and presents you with a menu), you're all set.  If <br>
	  it comes up to the SRM console (&gt;&gt;&gt; prompt), enter the command<br>
	  "SET OS NT" and power-cycle.<br>
<p>
	- Insert the "ARC utilities" disk.<br>
<p>
	Partition the disk(s):<br>
<p>
	- Choose "Run a program"<br>
<p>
	- Enter: <br>
		eisa(0)disk(0)fdisk(0)minlabel.exe  <br>
<p>
	  This invokes the standalone minlabel utility, which is <br>
	  exactly like the Linux minlabel utility.<br>
<p>
	- Choose the disk you are going to partition.  I have made<br>
	  every effort to make these utilities understand Linux-style<br>
	  device names, so you should be able to enter something like<br>
	  "/dev/sda"<br>
<p>
	- Partition the disk.  Most likely you'll want a small (4Mb)<br>
	  initial partition for the bootstrap, and the rest of the<br>
	  disk for Linux.  If you have only one disk on your system,<br>
	  you'll have to further partition the disk to provide a<br>
	  Linux partition and a swap partition.<br>
<p>
	- Exit the minlabel program.<br>
<p>
	Copy the Linux kernel to the boot partition:<br>
<p>
	- Choose "Run a program" from the ARC menu<br>
<p>
	- Enter: eisa(0)disk(0)fdisk(0)copyboot.exe<br>
<p>
	- Select source and destination devices<br>
	  (source is typically /dev/fd0, destination is /dev/sda, /dev/sdb,...)<br>
<p>
	- Remove the ARC utilities disk from the drive and insert the<br>
	  Linux boot disk.<br>
<p>
	- Hit ENTER to start copying.<br>
<p>
	Set up the system to come up to SRM console:<br>
<p>
	- Remove floppy from drive<br>
<p>
	- Select "Supplementary menu..."<br>
<p>
	- Select "Set up the system..."<br>
<p>
	- Select "Switch to OpenVMS or OSF console"<br>
<p>
	- Select "Switch to OSF"<br>
<p>
	- Type ESC<br>
<p>
	- Power-cycle the system.<br>
<p>
	Boot and install your system:<br>
<p>
	- At &gt;&gt;&gt; prompt, type:  BOOT -FL INSTALL DKAx00, where<br>
	  x00 refers to the boot device (DKA000 for SCSI device<br>
	  0, DKA100 for device 1, etc.)<br>
<p>
	- When prompted, insert RAMDisk floppy<br>
<p>
	- Install as usual for that distribution.<br>
<p>
Once you have installed Linux on your system, you can boot it from the<br>
SRM console by saying something like:<br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;&gt;&gt; boot -fl "root=0802 ro" dka000</i><br>
<p>
One future improvement I would like to work on would be to substitute<br>
a variant of MILO for the bootable kernel.  This would make booting new<br>
kernels much easier, as well as eliminating any need for abbreviated<br>
boot option strings.<br>
