Avi,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I've just spent a hundred dollars or so on what I assume to be a jensen in</i><br>
<i>&gt;Olivetti clothes. It's got Olivetti R7-600 on the front but digital all</i><br>
<i>&gt;over the back ;-). It's definately EISA based, and according to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Alpha-sys overview that makes it a Jensen.</i><br>
<p>
The EISA must mean JENSEN, only our bigger servers have EISA instead of ISA,<br>
and they always have PCI as well, at least now...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The unit was stripped; what's left is the Adaptec 1742 SCSI board, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Digital networkcard and a compaq Qvision 1280 card.</i><br>
<p>
The 1742 is fine, supported under LINUX for a *long* time, as its what Linus<br>
had first (the Jensen, that is... :-). Ditto for the network card, prolly a<br>
DE422. The QVision is the weak link; no current Xserver from XFree86, and not<br>
much chance for even a generic VGA one to work without *many* changes; JENSEN<br>
is problematic in a number of ways... :-( (see below for more info)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;1. What kind memory do I want and how much of it?</i><br>
<p>
Standard 72-pin SIMMS; I believe you need to fill a bank (4 slots) for it to<br>
work (inserted in alternating slots). And it may be much happier with 36-bit<br>
wide, rather than 32. But I'm not certain the 32's won't work? Anyone know for<br>
sure?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;2. Will any keyboard with a ps/2 style connector do?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, same for mouse, though serial mouse works well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;3. Will my AST fourpourt work?</i><br>
<p>
Uncertain; if it uses only inb/outb type accesses to IO space registers, then<br>
probably. If it's like the Cyclades driver I looked at, which has BUS memory<br>
space registers, then *NO*, it will need reworking, as access to BUS memory is<br>
not always transparent, but especially not on JENSEN.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;4. will my GUS Ultrasound work?</i><br>
<p>
There's a good chance; the latest rev of sound drivers (Voxware-3.5-beta-10?)<br>
is *very* good, portability-wise; SB16 and PAS16 are known to work out of the<br>
box. However, the GUS is prolly one of the more sophisticated drivers in there,<br>
and may have been tweaked for performance in ways that are less portable than<br>
some of the other drivers. I'd be *real* interested in knowing if it does work,<br>
as I get real tired of FM synthesis, having gotten accustomed to an AWE32 under<br>
WfW on my PC... :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;5. The various FAQ's etc. stated that X support was limited to a few</i><br>
<i>&gt;chipsets. Qvision I know isn't one of them. Are there EISA bases s3 cards?</i><br>
<p>
There was someone on the net in Europe, who claimed to have made mods to the<br>
S3 XFree86 server sources to get it running on a JENSEN. EISA boards are rare,<br>
I think; try to find  one of the 928-chipset ISA ones; they can be run with<br>
*no* BUS memory accesses, which may be slower but *will* work on JENSEN, given<br>
appropriate LIBC support for the inb/outb's the server does.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;6. will I be able to run Windows NT and Linux on the same machine?</i><br>
<p>
Should be able to, though currently you'd need to switch between ARC console<br>
(for NT) and SRM console (for LINUX), not to mention wrestling with the ECU<br>
for configuring the devices for NT. Both the QVision and an S3-928 were among<br>
the supported options under NT on the JENSEN.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And last but not least....</i><br>
<i>&gt;What do the buttons and the LCD on the front of the unit do and show? ;-)</i><br>
<p>
No clue, I've never seen one of these boxes. Anyone else?<br>
<p>
Good luck with it.<br>
