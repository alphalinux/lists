Howdy again!<br>
<p>
[For thoose that want to see the info I got about the model, I've included<br>
 it at the end of this message]<br>
<p>
1. Yes, the price is correct, but I think the catch is that its "edu" prices,<br>
   but many off the ppl on this list can buy like an "edu" customer I think.<br>
   I think Randy is may be correct that the "normal" price is $2690.<br>
<p>
2. Not pricecompetive with intel?<br>
	A "good" Pentium system are like this (Net Ex Prices):<br>
	Asus MB (w 512k PB) + 166Mhz P5 + ncr810 + 21040 Eth + Sound + 4x scsi<br>
		Cdrom + Case <br>
	 299 + 649 + 79 + ~100 + 89 + 189 + 70 = $1475<br>
<p>
   So the pricediff for me is $1668 - $1475 = $193<br>
<p>
   Myself will *easy* pay $193 extra for getting an real Digital <br>
   Alphastation, with Its 3 year warranty (1 year onsite).<br>
   And I think an 233Mhz 21064A with 1M external cache, will be faster<br>
   an "normal" Pentium board like Asus, with 512k PB cache. Even if <br>
   intels specint figures for the above may (I havent checked) may be a <br>
   bit higher in the int side, but I wouldn't trust them to much, so I <br>
   think the Alpha would be faster in real life. The Digital machine also <br>
   chips with an NT Ws linence, which some ppl thinks are worth about $200 <br>
   I think.  If my information is correct, the choice is easy for me.<br>
<p>
3. Be forced to buy 32M and hd? My supplier didn't mention that, and why<br>
   does digital list this machine wo hd/mem with a Part No (and there is<br>
   no special "note" besides it), if you can't buy it?<br>
<p>
4. Randy if you, or some other Alpha supplier, can compare (or beat) Digitals<br>
   price, you are very welcome to flood my mailbox with offers :-)<br>
<p>
Regards, <br>
<p>
/Mikael<br>
<p>
Mail I got from my supplier.. Note that like Randy said, these prices may<br>
very well be "edu" prices, and that the normal price for the $1668 model<br>
may be $2690. PB47A-CA.  Note that the 512k cache is wrong here, both my<br>
supplier and digitals webpage says its 1M.<br>
