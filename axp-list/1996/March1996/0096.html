Ok, so here's the state of things for elf64 and binutils (as of 2.6) as I<br>
see it.  The patches up to 2.6.0.2 (the newest on my CD) don't really give<br>
us anything major<br>
<p>
There appears to be some support of elf64 in BFD.  There is a target for<br>
elf64-sparc, but I've not tried to build a cross target to it (I'll do<br>
that and see if support is complete enough to compile the whole thing).<br>
It's possible it's not complete, the file is a bit short in comparison to<br>
the other processor specific stuff.  It could be that since efl64-sparc seems<br>
to be the only thing in there that it's tacked on to the elf32 stuff :-(<br>
<p>
Now, elf (even 32) support in gas does seem to be tacked on.  This is not at all<br>
the case with a.out or (E)COFF.  The gas ELF targets use routines from ecoff,<br>
which is a plus (?).  The alpha processor stuff is quite hardwired for a.out <br>
or ecoff.  It's not clear if other processor's targets are also hard wired like<br>
this (I've not looked), but it really doesn't matter, we will have to mess<br>
with the alpha specific stuff internals more than just providing <br>
&amp;alpha_little_silly_elf64_arch :-(<br>
<p>
Since gas is poorly integrated with ELF targets, that's where it's going to be <br>
work (provided that elf64-sparc target is complete).  Also, since I gather from<br>
the list that the official spec to define ELF64 is not complete, that the ELF64<br>
in BFD is just ELF32 with wide fields, except for the sparc specific stuff.  I<br>
figure this probably means that the kernel loader will be fairly trivial to <br>
change to support this type of ELF64.<br>
<p>
This might be a way to go.  BFD looks fairly simple (in comparison to gas, and<br>
I've not looked at gcc) to provide some kind of ELF64 for.  We can likely build<br>
an objcopy quickly.  Not that this will get us where we need (or shared libs,<br>
for that matter), but it's a start.  gas and gcc will take longer.  At least<br>
that's my assesment.  <br>
<p>
What do we want to do?<br>
