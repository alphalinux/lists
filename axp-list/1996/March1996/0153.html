<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Fri, 15 Mar 1996 16:54:16 -0600 (CST), (cosc1) 95h02740 &lt;<a href="mailto:yxc02740@Bayou.UH.EDU">yxc02740@Bayou.UH.EDU</a>&gt; said:</i><br>

<i>  &gt;&gt; I'm not sure if this qualifies as a bug in the technical sense,</i><br>
<i>  &gt;&gt; but it seems at least to be an inconsistany between Alpha</i><br>
<i>  &gt;&gt; Linux/GCC and x86 Linux/GCC.  I ran into this problem with the</i><br>
<i>  &gt;&gt; math lib function pow(), but it may occur elsewhere.  It occurs</i><br>
<i>  &gt;&gt; when incorrectly typed variables (ints, or longs) are passed to</i><br>
<i>  &gt;&gt; the pow() function, which as I understand, expects doubles.  I</i><br>
<i>  &gt;&gt; compiled the following code with GCC on a Linux/Pentium system</i><br>
<i>  &gt;&gt; and it works fine:</i><br>
<p>
  Yansong&gt; It is not a GCC bug, but it is a library bug. It turns out<br>
  Yansong&gt; that the linux/alpha's libm.a is not only slow, but also<br>
  Yansong&gt; buggy.<br>
<p>
Not just buggy and slow, but incomplete, too!  E.g., the Bessel<br>
functions are missing.  Moreover, it doesn't support float operations<br>
either (as opposed to double... :-)<br>
<p>
Why am I so happy about it?  Well, here is where GNU libc comes in: it<br>
just switched to a new math library that looks fairly complete and is<br>
specifically for IEEE-754.  With it, I get:<br>
<p>
&lt;--begin script--&gt;<br>
$ uname -a<br>
Linux koala.azstarnet.com 1.3.74 #60 Fri Mar 15 07:47:00 MST 1996alpha alpha<br>
$ cat foo.c<br>
#include &lt;math.h&gt;<br>
<p>
main()<br>
{<br>
    int i;<br>
    double x,y;<br>
    for (i=0;i&lt;21;i++)<br>
    {<br>
        x= pow(2.0,i);<br>
        y = (int)x;<br>
        printf("%d   %g %g\n",i,x,y);<br>
    }<br>
}<br>
$ gcc foo.c -lm<br>
$ ./a.out<br>
0   1 1<br>
1   2 2<br>
2   4 4<br>
3   8 8<br>
4   16 16<br>
5   32 32<br>
&lt;--end script--&gt;<br>
<p>
So it does seem to work fine.  What's the catch?  Well, I won't have<br>
time to do any serious testing of libm any time soon (the GNU libc<br>
folks are looking for a test suite, however, and I hear there may be<br>
something that is freely available, so this may not be as bad as it<br>
sounds).  Since there do seem to be people out there that (a) have<br>
more use for libm than I do (povray is about as tough as it gets with<br>
me) and (b) are more knowledgable with math, I propose that interested<br>
parties take a look at the libm as it comes with GNU libc.  I'd be<br>
happy to make a precompiled libm and the sources available so that<br>
anybody interested could hack away.  I see the following areas could<br>
use improvements:<br>
<p>
	(1) The current Alpha hardware does not support exceptional<br>
	numbers (non-finite) such as denormals or infinities or NaNs.  <br>
	This has two effects: First, it *may* affect the correctness of some<br>
	algorithms (e.g., the library may assume that the smallest finite<br>
	positive number divided by two gives a denormalized result,<br>
	not 0 as the Alpha hw provides by default).  While this is<br>
	possible source of concern, I don't think it will be a major<br>
	headache (doesn't the x87 FPU do something similar?  But maybe<br>
	I'm confusing it with the i960).  More importantly: since the Alpha<br>
	hardware will trap on input of any non-finite number, there is no<br>
	*need* to check for such values.  This often allows to speed up the<br>
	implementation significantly.  The C compiler will tell you what<br>
	degree of IEEE compliance is in effect by the presence/absence of<br>
	two CPP macros:<br>
<p>
		_IEEE_FP	=&gt; non-finite numbers are supported<br>
				   (with current chips, via compiler/OS<br>
				    support)<br>
		_IEEE_FP_INEXACT<br>
				=&gt; non-finite numbers as well as the<br>
				   IEEE INEXACT flag are supported<br>
<p>
	That is, if neither macro is defined, there is no point in<br>
	checking for (or generating) non-finite numbers.<br>
<p>
	(2) A lot of the float/double constants in the sources<br>
	reappear over and over again.  It would be quite a bit<br>
	more efficient to gather those constants into a single<br>
	array.  With current Linux/Alpha compiler technology,<br>
	this would typically save one memory access per constant.<br>
<p>
Oh, I did tune Linus's sqrt() a little bit more and we're now pretty<br>
competitive with the OSF/1 version (basically, we beat them whenever<br>
you don't do sqrt() for a living---i.e., whenever not all of the sqrt<br>
code/data is in the cache, which is not uncommon).  It also seems to<br>
be accurate: after testing it on 437,689,015,671 random numbers, I<br>
haven't found a single case where the result would have deviated from<br>
the result of the OSF/1 libm by a single bit.<br>
<p>
But other than this, not much has happened libm wise, AFAIK.<br>
