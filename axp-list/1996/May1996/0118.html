Sigh; let me quote my reaction to Craig's g77-0.5.8 announcement  <br>
back in February 1995:<br>

AAAAhhhh, Nukes have the name, but we (Meteo types) DO it: burning  <br>
CPU cycles in hopelessly optimised FORTRAN, with 5-page long DO  <br>
loops and scores of unimaginable and probably misspelled variable  <br>
names.<br>

And you can be assured:  With 4 CPU's, a decent memory system _and_  <br>
a parallellising compiler I'll get a close-to-four-times speedup  <br>
:-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Umm.. I have to speak up for intel here.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  The PPro-200 is definitely not low-end, and it squarely</i><br>
<i>&gt;  beats all alpha EV5-300's I've seen on some things (and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I'm not even counting software availability). The PPro</i><br>
<i>&gt;  usually has a reasonable memory subsystem (the same can't</i><br>
<i>&gt;  be said of the ev5's I've seen), and it has a very</i><br>
<i>&gt;  reasonable price.</i><br>
<p>
Yep; can you say: 4-way interleaved memory ?  I know you could :-)<br>
<p>
Oh, for those who don't know:  Numerical Weather Prediction codes  <br>
trample all the memory they get, each and every time step. No use  <br>
for caches :-)<br>
<p>
[ ... Sound analysis deleted for brevity ... ]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  When compared to the PPro, the alpha has got a few things</i><br>
<i>&gt;  going for it:</i><br>
<i>&gt;   - the "fun" factor. It's more interesting than a PC.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   - the "64 bit" factor. This can be the "sine qua non"</i><br>
<i>&gt;     in some circumstances.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   - the ev5 _is_ actually faster on basic arithmetic floating point </i><br>
<i>&gt;     and many integer operations.</i><br>
<p>
Aaaannnd, it has 32 integer registers.  Seriously, without integer  <br>
registers, your "floating point intensive" Fortran codes will have  <br>
_no_ performance; you _have_ to have them for indexing in all those  <br>
arrays.  Someone posted a message on c.o.l.m that he saw a 25 %  <br>
performance decrease when going from a.out-Linux to ELF-Linux.  The  <br>
most probable cause is that ELF compilations need (grab) another  <br>
integer register, to hold the PIC-offset.  That's 8 integer  <br>
registers, minus stack pointer, minus frame pointer, minus PIC-base  <br>
register, is 5.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  As far as the OS is concerned, the EV5-300 looks like</i><br>
<i>&gt;  it's about 10-20% faster, and that's not a huge margin).</i><br>
<p>
Aaahhh, but nobody's going to buy a machine to just run the OS;  <br>
seriously, I've been in the OS business for 7 years before I picked  <br>
up a physics job again:  As soon as the OS starts to take more than  <br>
a few percent of the machine's CPU resources, I get _very_ nervous.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Don't take me wrong, I love the alpha, but I'd love to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  have a PPro-200 _too_. And the PPro I might actually have</i><br>
<i>&gt;  enough money to buy..</i><br>
<p>
Well, it's certainly true that, to people who are on a tight  <br>
budget, I would advise to take a good look at the PPro.  The problem  <br>
with these machines is that, as soon as you've seen the glossies,  <br>
selling PPro-200's to the largest secretary school over here, you'll  <br>
almost automatically conclude it's not for you :-)<br>
