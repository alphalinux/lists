<p>
*yikes!* Here's where I have a quite different attitude/approach.  We run <br>
several commercial OSs (mostly UNICES but some vaxen) here, and we <br>
consider vendor supported versions of Linux to be commercial.  In point <br>
of fact, I have started a push to migrate all of our 2nd line servers and <br>
some front line servers over to RedHat Linux 3.0.3 (Caldera Network Desktop) <br>
and 2.1 AXP.  <br>
   I(we) support Linux not because it's "free" (we don't run any <br>
downloaded versions - only what we buy with support from a vendor) but <br>
because of the spirit in which it was created and in which it continues <br>
to be developed.  I have made several changes to the kernel (such as <br>
putting in a cryptographic file system with file/dir/inode level <br>
encryption and challenge/pwd) and like being able to "steer" and add to <br>
the continual evolution of this great OS.<br>
   However, we have need to run applications that are not currently <br>
available free for download nor would probably ever be free.  With the <br>
Internet Office Suite from Caldera, you get your commercial spreadsheets, <br>
word processors, etc, and I find working in a Unix or Unix-esque <br>
environment much more enjoyable (and productive) than jumping on an NT or <br>
other windows machine.  <br>
   Linux ain't just for the `hackers and slackers' anymore.  It's being <br>
found in more and more production environments in roles such as primary <br>
Internet Servers to Frame Relay routers to personal workstations.  It's <br>
gotten more respect and is being seen as a more viable alternative as <br>
time progresses to other more costly OSs - not because it's <br>
free/cheaper, but because of the ability to change things if you don't <br>
like them, widely supported native applications (AXP is getting there, <br>
but would still like to see OSF/COFF support just because I have &gt;5 DECs <br>
running 3.2C - 4.0 and would like to see some compatibility between the <br>
twain), and the fact that you can reach almost at any time someone that <br>
can help you with a problem you've run into with Linux.<br>
    I certainly want to see Linux continue in the spirit in which it was <br>
created, but "free" does not, IMHO, mean the OS, it's applications, and <br>
it's documentation must always remain available without cost (it *always* <br>
costs somebody something) and anyone who puts alot of sweat into an <br>
application, or prints up documentation and binds it nicely, etc  and <br>
wants to see a return so that they can, say, feed their kids or put food <br>
in their belly, then I fully support it.  If somone put their <br>
documentation up in HTML/SGML format or included it in a package that I <br>
often use, I say good.  But if they also offer it nicely bound and printed, <br>
then I'd gladly pay $50 bucks for it - especially if I knew I was helping out <br>
someone who was struggling and was trying to contribute something to our <br>
community.  My primary concern is that the knowledge of *how* to code <br>
commercial grade applications on a particular platform doesn't stay only <br>
with those that can afford to pay to know.  So far, DEC has been very <br>
good to us in this respect.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Actually, I'd like some books on Alpha assembler. Where do you send off for</i><br>
<i>&gt; this type of literature?</i><br>
<p>
I bought the entire documentation package from our vendor and it included <br>
lots o' GREAT books ranging from how to write a well behaved device <br>
driver to network administration to API programming.<br>
