<i>&gt; Your are lucky ;) I have been calling every shop which I know to sell</i><br>
<i>&gt; memory chips but haven't been terribly succesful. I called DEC to and</i><br>
<i>&gt; was told that they have supply problems too.</i><br>
<p>
 I ran through all that. DEC picked an uncommon part. They are not<br>
easy to get. I didnt get any one I could call in the US either. I<br>
got a 1800 number for some one, but 1800 numbers are domestic only.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; I like to get the 15ns chips to optimize performance. This mail</i><br>
<p>
 My chips are labeled 15ns, but do not work at that speed. So be warned.<br>
Some reported on the list that they couldnt get their 15ns marked chips<br>
to work relably at 20ns...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; BTW: I have installed the Linux distribution from gatekeeper. No sweat</i><br>
<i>&gt; to install it, but I am getting console messages looking like</i><br>
<i>&gt; debugging messages - very anoying....</i><br>
<p>
 BLADE ? . It was an quick hack. There is a real distribution now. RedHat.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Did you have the same problem and what did you do to get rid of them?</i><br>
<p>
 I didnt install from a Distribution. I built the system by hand. BLADE didnt<br>
even exist then. I used a OSF system to partition the disk in the first<br>
instance. Booted off floppy and build the root fs buy hand, coping the base<br>
system via floppy.<br>
 A lot of debugging messages were in those early kernels, of which BLADE<br>
is based.<br>
<p>
 Once I got the system to the point it could build it self, I enabled<br>
fdisk style partitions , some one had just gotten the IDE driver working,<br>
so I then used an IDE disk swaping between an Linux/86 system and Linux/AXP<br>
to get increasingly large archives of utilities accross.<br>
 Those days you also had to apply patches to the source to get it to compile<br>
under gcc. Linus was building AXP kernels under OSF/1 with DEC's compiler<br>
at the time.<br>
<p>
<p>
 BTW, my order for cache RAM took 4 months to be filled....<br>
 <br>
<p>
 If you want, ill email you a 1.3.97 vmlinux. Its big though....<br>
