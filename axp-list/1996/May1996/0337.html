Dominique,<br>
<p>
Although I can sympathise with the feelings expressed in your  <br>
reaction to Craigs mail on this list [ I could only afford a  <br>
computer when I was 24 - before that I used a programmable  <br>
calculator, and before that slide rules and log tables ] I have to  <br>
take issue with some of the thoughts, bringing up points that Craig  <br>
probably won't get into by himself.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    The respective lengths of our messages and the arguments</i><br>
<i>&gt;  developped therein may be summed up in a few words :</i><br>
<i>&gt;  you are a professionnal and I am a 20-year old student.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  You foresee very far in the future, and I am only</i><br>
<i>&gt;  concerned in my immediate pleasure, (unfortunately ?)</i><br>
<i>&gt;  consisting in lots of NIH, and a delicious sensation of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  domination over the Machine by understanding the least</i><br>
<i>&gt;  detail of it's behaviour. You are ready to make balanced</i><br>
<i>&gt;  compromises, but I am an idealist : I take GPL and POSIX</i><br>
<i>&gt;  for divine speech, and I want *all* the knowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt;  (software and documentation) for $0 (not $50, not $1 --</i><br>
<i>&gt;  please remember that I am a french student and that</i><br>
<i>&gt;  dollars are expensive to me :-).  And I am ready to drive</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Linux into an economical dead end (just like the Amiga,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the comparison was right) or to damage its future in any</i><br>
<i>&gt;  way if for the sake of code beauty.</i><br>
<p>
Note that there is an implicit assumption in the above paragraph  <br>
that 'a professional is someone who doesn't mind spending gobs of  <br>
money on XXX'.  When I bought my first computer - 16 years ago - it  <br>
cost the equivalent of several summers jobs of work (I only was a  <br>
poor student at that time).  We didn't have a free OS, or free  <br>
software anyway, back then; you got a paper listing of the ROM  <br>
monitor - take it from there :-).  Especially Craig is someone, for  <br>
whom the above quoted misunderstanding _doesn't_ apply, and this is  <br>
something that should be hammered into the heads of all the  <br>
[good-willing] hot-heads in the Linux community:  There is NO  <br>
relation between the amount of money you make and 'professionalism'.  <br>
 Professionalism is an attitude towards 'problem-solving',  <br>
'treating "customers" - even if they're not paying', 'design', etc.<br>
<p>
One of the problems facing Linux (and all GNU-type free software)  <br>
is, that people view upon it as "not costing any money".  This,  <br>
however, is not what is meant by "free", at least not in the GNU  <br>
sense; that is about "freedom", i.e. being able to use the software  <br>
(and its sources) freely.  The problem in the first "definition" is  <br>
that it equates to "cheap", "second-hand", "throw-away job", etc.  I  <br>
do not have any problem (financially) supporting the FSF, because I  <br>
_know_ this organisation aspires to quality - but I wouldn't give a  <br>
dime for the "it costs $0 so that's what I'm gonna use because I'm  <br>
a poor student" mentality.<br>
