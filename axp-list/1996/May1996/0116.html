Umm.. I have to speak up for intel here.<br>
<p>
The PPro-200 is definitely not low-end, and it squarely beats all alpha<br>
EV5-300's I've seen on some things (and I'm not even counting software<br>
availability). The PPro usually has a reasonable memory subsystem (the same<br>
can't be said of the ev5's I've seen), and it has a very reasonable price. <br>
<p>
A quad P6 box isn't low-end by _any_ standards, unless your standards run<br>
toward Cray or similar. Four CPU's is also a reasonable number in that you<br>
have a chance in h*ll to actually get some useful work done with Linux on<br>
them (ie it's few enough that the current Linux SMP implementation scales<br>
reasonably for many things, but quite as importantly it's also few enough<br>
that you can fill them up with a reasonable mix of jobs even without any<br>
special hacking). <br>
<p>
With four CPU's, "make -j3" or similar works fine, and you are likely to get<br>
some boots when running X etc. In short, a _normal_ developer is likely to<br>
notice, not just people using PVM. <br>
<p>
Let's face it - intel did very well indeed with the PPro. It does badly on<br>
floating point (but "badly" here means that it kicks ass when compared<br>
against just about any chip that is a few years old and people who are<br>
unhappy with PPro in that department probably wouldn't really be thrilled by<br>
anything smaller than a 8-CPU ev5-machine), but it's very impressive indeed<br>
on integer and most impressive on price. <br>
<p>
Thanks to the large internal caches on the PPro, a quad PPro box is not only<br>
cheap to produce (built-in logic for just about everything you need so you<br>
just connect them together), but it actually should give reasonable<br>
performance. It may not be up there in the "serious computing" league, but it<br>
probably makes most machines that cost 10 times as much very nervous indeed. <br>
<p>
When compared to the PPro, the alpha has got a few things going for it:<br>
 - the "fun" factor. It's more interesting than a PC.<br>
 - the "64 bit" factor. This can be the "sine qua non" in some <br>
   circumstances.<br>
 - the ev5 _is_ actually faster on basic arithmetic floating point and<br>
   many integer operations.<br>
<p>
But anybody calling the PPro "low end" is seriously deluding himself (I can<br>
compare numbers between Linux on a EV5-300 and Linux on a PPro-200, and they<br>
are _close_. As far as the OS is concerned, the EV5-300 looks like it's about<br>
10-20% faster, and that's not a huge margin).<br>
<p>
Don't take me wrong, I love the alpha, but I'd love to have a PPro-200 <br>
_too_. And the PPro I might actually have enough money to buy..<br>
