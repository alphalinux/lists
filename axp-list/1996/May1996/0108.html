It really is time somebody write that paper entitled "Why Low-End<br>
Multiprocessing is a Dumb Idea (unless your a nuclear physicist or<br>
Intel)".<br>
<p>
Yes, multiprocessing has it's place.  But the problem with low-end<br>
multiprocessing is that people seem to believe that if they stick N<br>
CPUs in a given box, then everything will go faster by a factor of N.<br>
There are several reasons why that isn't always true, some obvious,<br>
some more subtle:<br>
<p>
 (a) Any given application will run at the speed of exactly one CPU unless<br>
     that application is parallelized.  That is, you'll wait for gcc, make,<br>
     and povray just as long as you did before.<br>
<p>
 (b) Parallelizing an application will fix some of the problems with (a),<br>
     but the cost (and complexity) of doing so is not trivial.  Furthermore,<br>
     many applications just don't parallelize all that well.  Even in a good<br>
     case, it is often considered a great achievement if your application<br>
     speeds up by a factor of 3 when throwing 4 CPUs at it.  Sometimes an<br>
     application doesn't speed up at all because the synchronization overheads<br>
     are so large.<br>
<p>
 (c) Job level paralellism is the cheapest (and IMHO the most practical)<br>
     way of exploiting multiple CPUs: you just tell make, for example, to get<br>
     N compiles going simultaneously.  The problem here is that if you have<br>
     N apps going simultaneously you better make sure you have (i) enough<br>
     memory and (ii) enough I/O bandwidth.  Considering that most low-end<br>
     PCs have super-fast CPUs on top of a crummy memory system with 16MB<br>
     of RAM and an IDE drive, how likely is it that a system with N CPUs<br>
     will have an adequate memory/I/O system?  I claim that chance is virtually<br>
     nil.  Why?  Memory and I/O bandwidth, unlike CPUs, cost money.  It's<br>
     as simple as that.<br>
<p>
I'm not saying low-end multiprocessing never makes sense.  There are<br>
applications that are so compute bound that little else matters (e.g.,<br>
computing Mandelbrot sets comes to mind).  But most application I can<br>
think of that currently are "too slow" either have substantial<br>
workingsets (==lots of memory) or need lots of I/O or memory<br>
bandwidth.<br>
<p>
IMHO, here is where I think it is worthwhile spending money on:<br>
<p>
	- get as much memory as you can afford---the best CPU won't help<br>
	  if you spend all your time waiting for the disk<br>
<p>
	- if you have a choice between a system with N CPUs or a system<br>
	  with one CPU that's N times faster, you always want the latter<br>
	  (all else being equal, of course)<br>
<p>
In case it isn't clear: this has nothing to do with Alpha vs x86.<br>
It's strictly single-CPU vs multi-CPU.<br>
