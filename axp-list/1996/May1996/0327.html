Dominique,<br>
	as I wrote Milo, I'll answer your questions that relate to it...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I'm a newbie to Alpha programming, and I often feel lost in it... For sure it</i><br>
<i>&gt;is part because I am french and Slackware-addicted :-),</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
	Yes, I like Slackware too, but I run Red Hat at home and at work<br>
	now 'cos the upgrading is easier.  However Slackware is easier to<br>
	tailor down the system size to use less disk.<br>
<p>
seems to me more private than on Intel : you must *purchase* the technical<br>
documentation from Digital ! And the FAQ's seem slim to me : what is a PALcode<br>
? And why does Milo need to be rebuilt as often as the kernel ? And how is the<br>
limit between Milo and the kernel set ?<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;	Hmm, sorry?   I think that we (Digital) have been incredibly open</i><br>
<i>&gt;	with this (don't even try and get me started about how open Digital</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	Unix is versus HPUnix).  We've made everything that we can widely </i><br>
<i>&gt;	available.   Do Intel give away the sources to their BIOS?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;	The FAQs are constantly evolving but right now they are pretty good.</i><br>
<i>&gt;	Your PALcode question is briefly answered in my Milo HOWTO but maybe</i><br>
<i>&gt;	David Mosberger-Tang should include a section in his Alpha FAQ.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;	also covered PALcode in the article that appeared in the Linux </i><br>
<i>&gt;	Journal this January.  Generally speaking, you do not need to worry</i><br>
<i>&gt;	about PALcode, take what there is in Milo and use it.   </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;	Milo does not have to be rebuilt as often as the kernel.  It depends</i><br>
<i>&gt;	on services in the kernel (eg interrupt handling), therefore as the</i><br>
<i>&gt;	kernel evolves I produce new versions of Milo.  For the last few </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	months there have been no new features in Milo so the only reason for</i><br>
<i>&gt;	rebuilding it would be to add in new drivers.   Right now the Qlogic</i><br>
<i>&gt;	fast and wide SCSI driver is being worked on and I have just built</i><br>
<i>&gt;	all new Milo images including that (and the NCR) SCSI drivers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;	Just like the kernel I would expect a large proportion of people to </i><br>
<i>&gt;	never ever rebuild Milo but to use whatever was on the web/CD.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;	Building Milo takes no more expertise than building the kernel </i><br>
<i>&gt;	(hacking it doesn't either).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;	Which 'limit' between Milo and the kernel?  Functional? Memory?</i><br>
<i>&gt;	Milo does a full system set up (eg PCI) and tells the kernel how</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	much memory there is and what sort of system this is (see /proc/cpuinfo).</i><br>
<i>&gt;	Generally, the kernel then re-does the set up as it takes over </i><br>
<i>&gt;	complete control of the system</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
