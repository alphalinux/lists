<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Wed, 8 May 1996 08:30:20 +0300 (EET DST), Linus Torvalds &lt;<a href="mailto:torvalds@cs.Helsinki.FI">torvalds@cs.Helsinki.FI</a>&gt; said:</i><br>
<p>
  Linus&gt; But anybody calling the PPro "low end" is seriously deluding<br>
  Linus&gt; himself (I can compare numbers between Linux on a EV5-300 and<br>
  Linus&gt; Linux on a PPro-200, and they are _close_. As far as the OS<br>
  Linus&gt; is concerned, the EV5-300 looks like it's about 10-20%<br>
  Linus&gt; faster, and that's not a huge margin).<br>
<p>
  Linus&gt; Don't take me wrong, I love the alpha, but I'd love to have a<br>
  Linus&gt; PPro-200 _too_. And the PPro I might actually have enough<br>
  Linus&gt; money to buy..<br>
<p>
It's a pity you took my mail to be P6 vs Alpha.  It was just what it<br>
said: about low-end multiprocessing.  By that I mean the folks who<br>
take a motherboard designed for a single processor and simply plug in<br>
N CPUs.  Thanks to on-chip caches, there is *some* benefit to doing<br>
this, but not for an awful many apps, IMHO (hence the "nuclear<br>
physicist"...).<br>
<p>
Maybe you took offense at the "Intel" part of the title.  It would<br>
have been better to say "Chip Manufacturer", but lets face it, it<br>
doesn't sound quite as catchy...  :-) (And I guess it is Intel that<br>
popularized low-end SMPs.)<br>
<p>
I don't think I ever called a P6 "low end".  And maybe the 4 CPU<br>
systems that are out there even make sense for a reasonably wide range<br>
of people.  But I'd bet that the vast majority of systems out there in<br>
PC-land are hopelessly starved for RAM---I know it's true for all the<br>
machines that are in my home.  Not an awfully representative sample,<br>
but it is funny given that I *know* about the importance of RAM etc...<br>
And I won't even get into the issues of I/O bandwidth.  In *that* kind<br>
of context, plugging in more CPUs is just silly.<br>
