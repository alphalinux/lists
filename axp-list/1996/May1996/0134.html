Umm, while I agree that it might make it a lot easier to debug things on the<br>
alpha, I hope nobody writes a patch like that for gdb. The reason I hope that<br>
is that I hope that it will be unnecessary. The _correct_ way to handle it is<br>
to never generate those d*mn instructions in the first place. We need an<br>
optimizing linker that gets rid of them and makes it into a single "bsr"<br>
instruction instead. <br>
<p>
The reasons for doing it with "bsr":<br>
 - it's smaller (no data space needed, and only 1 insn)<br>
 - it's faster (roughly 10-1000 times faster! The load will stall, and it <br>
   will stall a _lot_ if it wasn't in the cache)<br>
 - it doesn't have any problems like the above when debugging - you see <br>
   the bsr target quite well.<br>
 - secondary issues: cache footprints etc.<br>
<p>
The reason it's not done with "bsr" now:<br>
 - the compiler can't know at compile-time if the target will be within <br>
   21 bits (or whatever the branch offset was). In 99% of all cases it <br>
   _will_ be in range, and it's essentially just calling a shared library <br>
   that can't be optimized.<br>
 - thus the linker needs to do the optimizing, and the linker isn't <br>
   clever enough (it should also look at the target, and jump over any <br>
   "ldgp" instructions when it's within the same ldgp area).<br>
<p>
So if somebody wants to do something worthwhile on the alpha, and doesn't <br>
like the instruction scheduling stuff, _this_ single optimization would <br>
probably make more of a difference..  The easy way to handle it is within <br>
the compiler (make gcc always use "bsr" and never reload "gp"), but that <br>
doesn't work for the generic case, so it's not really worth pursuing (I <br>
wrote patches to gcc that did it, but I threw them away after I noticed <br>
all the problems with shared libs etc).<br>
<p>
gcc _does_ produce "bsr" calls, but only for local jumps (static <br>
functions or calls to a function that was defined earlier in the same <br>
source file). That makes it very inefficient to do subroutine calls (it's <br>
not just the added instructions, it's the data segment access I don't <br>
like either).<br>
<p>
There are some other optimizations that it would be interesting if gcc did:<br>
"known alignment byte and word fetch/store". There are cases where you know<br>
the alignment of a byte or short value (when the access is through a<br>
structure or union that has guaranteed alignment due to other larger<br>
members), but gcc creates code for the generic byte load case. For example: <br>
<p>
	struct example {<br>
		struct example * next;<br>
		unsigned char data;<br>
	};<br>
<p>
gcc will compile "example-&gt;data = 1" as something like this (note the silly<br>
"addq $16,8,$3", even though we are only interested in the low 7 bits of the<br>
address for the byte masking ops, but note even more the whole broken<br>
algorithm): <br>
<p>
        ldq_u $2,8($16)<br>
        bis $31,1,$1<br>
        addq $16,8,$3<br>
        insbl $1,$3,$1<br>
        mskbl $2,$3,$2<br>
        bis $1,$2,$1<br>
        stq_u $1,8($16)<br>
<p>
it _should_ be something like this (note that this example happens to be <br>
exactly aligned on a 8-byte boundary, but the same thing works with very <br>
minor modifications for any structure byte access, because we know what <br>
the alignment withing the quadword should be): <br>
<p>
	ldq $1,8($16)<br>
	zap $1,1,$1<br>
	bis $1,1,$1<br>
	stq $1,8($16)<br>
<p>
I would really like to get the code density a bit better - alpha binaries are<br>
inherently larger than x86 and most others, but it doesn't exactly help that<br>
gcc is stupid in some ways. And I'd like to work on gcc - I've done small<br>
hacks before and it could be interesting - but I don't honestly think I'll<br>
have the time to do anything real.. <br>
