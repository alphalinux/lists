Dear Erik<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Digital does not stamp a Alpha processor with a speed UNTIL they are sold.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This seems extremely unlikely.  Can you please provide a contact at Digital</i><br>
<i>&gt;Semiconductor with whom I can verify this claim?  </i><br>
<p>
I'll ask my source but no guarantees.  Let me clarify what I've been told.<br>
When Digital has a production of processors they are tested at specific<br>
speeds and then put into bins.  Now as I mentioned eariler they are not<br>
stamped until sold. Therefore, if an order comes in for a large quantity of<br>
"X" and they run out but have "Y" processors and will run faster that were<br>
sorted out for higher speed needs they use "Y" to simply fill the order.<br>
<p>
Are you also aware that Digital has the following:<br>
<p>
        NT/Linux                Digital Unix<br>
        21064a/P1-275Mhz        21064a/DB-275<br>
        21164/P1-266mhz         21164/AA-266<br>
        21164/P2-300mhz         21164/BA-300<br>
        na                      21164/CA-333<br>
<p>
Now can you tell me the difference between the parts with the exception of<br>
the price?  Do you think there is a difference?  Wanna make a bet?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It is normal practice at semiconductor companies for manufacturing to be</i><br>
told &gt;that sales needs x parts at a lower speed and y parts at a higher<br>
speed.  But &gt;you would have me believe that if I order 25 chips at 233 MHz,<br>
they are going &gt;to take some unmarked chips and run them through a tester to<br>
fill my order.  <br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This would, however, explain why the chips are so expensive :-)</i><br>
<p>
Bingo!  Now with respect to price you have to remember Digital builds<br>
workstations based on the Digital Alpha processor.  In the workstation arena<br>
they are competitively priced.  Sun, HP and SGI still have nothing IN the<br>
same price range that can touch the Alpha systems.  I know because I sell HP<br>
and Sun.<br>
<p>
However, most people want them at PC prices when from want I've seen so far<br>
Intel has nothing that can touch them in performance.  I agree it would be<br>
great to see them a lower prices but when you look at the field of systems<br>
on the market Digital Alpha still reigns as the fastest processor available.<br>
<p>
{stuff deleted}<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I notice that you did not take up my previous challenge to explain exactly</i><br>
<i>&gt;what testing DCG performs to verify that the chip won't experience subtle</i><br>
<i>&gt;errors due to overclocking.  If the chips truly have such good yields at</i><br>
<i>&gt;higher clock rates over the full range of operating specifications, one would</i><br>
<i>&gt;think they would want to sell that speed grade (for a premium price, of</i><br>
<i>&gt;course).</i><br>
<p>
You never directed a challenge to me.  Furthermore, a Digital employee did<br>
respond and say it was common practice within Digital to run overclocked<br>
systems inhouse for testing and that they were solid.<br>
<p>
In addition, I direct you to the new Digital Alphastation 255/300Mhz<br>
workstation.  This workstation is available running Digital Unix and with a<br>
21064a/DB-275 running at 300Mhz!!!!!!<br>
<p>
Check it out digital has not released a 21064a-300Mhz part, so what can it<br>
be? Answer, a 275 CLOCKED up running 300Mhz!<br>
<p>
Since your the expert let me know if a new chip has entered the market,<br>
because no one at Digital can tell me of such a part exists.<br>
<p>
Info on the system is available at <br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.alphastation.digital.com/products/a255.html">http://www.alphastation.digital.com/products/a255.html</a><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;My new challenge to you is even simpler:  provide us with a contact inside</i><br>
<i>&gt;Digital who is willing to state for the record that Digital's Alpha chips</i><br>
<i>&gt;will operate reliably at 110% of the rated clock speed.</i><br>
<p>
As I have mentioned above, I'll see if my Digital source will respond.<br>
However, I believe the Alphastation 255-300Mhz says it all.<br>
<p>
One final note, we stand behind all our systems with full warranties and<br>
never force any customer to purchase anything they don't want.  Furthermore,<br>
we do carry unclocked systems too!<br>
<p>
As I have mentioned before, when the first Jensen rolled off the line we're<br>
installing fans on the processor and clocking them up...five years later<br>
they're still running!  <br>
<p>
Were are these errors you claim we should be seeing?<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
 <br>
Steve<br>
