GNU Fortran (g77) needs to be improved to support the DEC Alpha<br>
to a level on par with its support for other instruction-set<br>
architectures, such as SPARC, ix86, and so on.<br>
<p>
As g77 author, I've known of Alpha problems for quite a while<br>
(over a year now, I believe), but although I made an abortive<br>
attempt to address them via net access to an Alpha several<br>
months ago, I've not had the time to make progress on this front.<br>
<p>
On April 24, Mauro DePalma &lt;<a href="mailto:mauro@craftwork.com">mauro@craftwork.com</a>&gt; of Craftworks,<br>
an organization that develops Linux distributions, contacted me<br>
about improving g77 the Alpha.  I explained that, while future<br>
plans for g77 version 0.6 included improvements that would<br>
likely address most, if not all, Alpha-related problems, the<br>
lack of ongoing easy access to an actual machine made it<br>
quite unlikely that I, personally, would do the work prior to<br>
0.6 (which will take a few months to do, for other reasons).<br>
<p>
Mauro responded by contacting Carrera Computers and DCG and<br>
working up some kind of deal.<br>
<p>
As a result, Saturday morning May 4, I received a DEC Alpha<br>
Cabriolet running Craftworks Linux/AXP 2.1.  The system's<br>
pretty complete, though I did augment it with the necessary<br>
monitor (I bought a Nanao T2-17).<br>
<p>
This system is being loaned to me for the express purpose of<br>
getting g77 "up to snuff" on it, so people won't have g77<br>
as an excuse to not buy Alphas anymore.  (There are other<br>
aspects to the loan that I won't discuss here, but they're<br>
highly favorable to my likely being able to continue working<br>
on g77 support for Alpha, perhaps even replacing my Linux 486/33<br>
with the Alpha as my primary development machine for g77<br>
as the software matures.)<br>
<p>
I've had only a little time to work on it so far, but I have<br>
played with it a bit and installed X.  (Well, I always figured<br>
I'd be able to beat my chest someday when I said "I installed<br>
X on a system, and it works!!" -- but Craftworks Linux makes<br>
that so easy I probably shouldn't mention that I installed it<br>
at all.)<br>
<p>
I'm still holding down a temporary full-time job at Cadence,<br>
so this week I expect the only progress I'll make is, say,<br>
installing Emacs, getting a modem up and running on the new<br>
machine, maybe connecting it and my Linux 486/33 either<br>
via serial cable or, down the road, via networking.  (For<br>
space reasons, it's not possible to place them side by side<br>
and work on both of them comfortably, but we are looking into<br>
finishing our basement to make this sort of thing much easier.)<br>
<p>
I have already built the gcc-2.7.2 and g77-0.5.17 shipped<br>
with the system, just to observe that process (and see how<br>
fast it goes -- that's what I mean by "playing").<br>
<p>
This weekend, I plan to start work on getting g77 to work<br>
better on the Alpha.  I don't know how long this will take,<br>
but I'm fairly confident that I'll find and fix most or all<br>
of the g77 problems within a couple of weekends.  Most of<br>
my uncertainty has to do with the degree to which libf2c, gcc,<br>
gdb, and so on need juicing, since I have less expertise on<br>
their internals than on g77.<br>
<p>
So, while I can't promise any particular _dates_ at this point,<br>
and won't be working 40 hours a week on this for at least<br>
another few weeks, it's _possible_ that Craftworks will have<br>
a version of g77, based on 0.5.18 or 0.5.19, with patches<br>
that greatly improve its support for the DEC Alpha in the<br>
2-6-week time frame.  (Actually, I think that timeframe is<br>
more than possible -- likely, even.)  I'm probably going<br>
to run them through a quick alpha-test (using the tried and<br>
true g77 alpha testers) first, but "alpha" here refers<br>
to testing, not computers, and that's done mostly in private<br>
for g77 still, to make sure I haven't something important out.<br>
<p>
After the Alpha patches to g77 prove themselves, I certainly<br>
plan to integrate them into the appropriate FSF-approved<br>
release.  That might be g77-0.5.20, depending on timing, etc.<br>
<p>
I have to say, I'm quite impressed with the responsiveness<br>
demonstrated by Craftworks, Carerra, and DCG.  It suggests<br>
to me a long-term commitment to the DEC Alpha chip as<br>
a solution for their customers, because, after all, they could<br>
have saved a bunch of cash, time, and trouble by just waiting<br>
for g77 Alpha support to "happen" or for someone else to<br>
loan me a machine.  (In fact, I still have the email address<br>
of someone at Digital I was going to contact when I felt I<br>
was nearing the point of being able to commit 40 hours a week<br>
in "payment" for being loaned, given, or given a great deal<br>
on a machine -- so it's not like I'm saying nobody was willing<br>
to get me one, because I hadn't asked anyone to yet, just that<br>
these three organizations really were quite aggressive about<br>
doing so.)  So, I conclude they plan to be in this business<br>
for quite a while, to make this sort of investment worth making.<br>
<p>
People you might want to thank for this (and, yes, I expect<br>
they'll be listed in the "Contributions" section of the<br>
g77 documentation in versions that support the Alpha):<br>
