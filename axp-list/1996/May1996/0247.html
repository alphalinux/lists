<i>&gt; Digital does not stamp a Alpha processor with a speed UNTIL they are sold.</i><br>
<p>
This seems extremely unlikely.  Can you please provide a contact at Digital<br>
Semiconductor with whom I can verify this claim?  It is normal practice at<br>
semiconductor companies for manufacturing to be told that sales needs x parts<br>
at a lower speed and y parts at a higher speed.  But you would have me believe<br>
that if I order 25 chips at 233 MHz, they are going to take some unmarked<br>
chips and run them through a tester to fill my order.  <br>
<p>
This would, however, explain why the chips are so expensive :-)<br>
<p>
All the semiconductor vendors I'm familiar with do the device parametric<br>
testing immediately after packaging.  They don't want a bunch of untested<br>
parts sitting around waiting for orders, because they would have no certainty<br>
of being able to satisfy those orders.  Many semiconductor vendors even give<br>
a flow chart of the production flow in their data books, although I haven't<br>
seen one for Digital Semiconductor.<br>
<p>
It is often the case that many parts are sold as lower speed parts that<br>
were untested at the higher speed but would have passed.  However, since they<br>
are untested there is no way to be certain.  So many people will run the<br>
part at the higher speed.  And if there are no *obvious* problems, they<br>
assume that it will work fine.  But what if critical signal paths in the chip<br>
are right at the edge?  Can you really determine that the chip won't drop a<br>
bit once in a while?  When a semiconductor company rates a chip at a<br>
particular speed, they actually test it to an even faster speed (and under<br>
the full range of operating specifications) to make sure that it isn't right<br>
on the hairy edge.  But when you just crank the clock and see that it *seems*<br>
to work, how can you have any confidence in it?<br>
<p>
In the case of the Multia/UDB, what people are doing is even more questionable.<br>
They are taking 21066A parts that Digital has tested for 233 MHz, and running<br>
them at 266 MHz.  However, Digital doesn't even *offer* 266 MHz parts, so<br>
there's not even a theoretical basis for expecting them to work reliably at<br>
that speed.<br>
<p>
Some people have argued that since the 21066A uses the same core CPU and<br>
process as the 21064A, it should run as fast.  And Digital does offer faster<br>
21064A parts.  But even if the 21066A die was exactly the same as the 21064A<br>
die, it still wouldn't mean that you could expect to run them as fast.  The<br>
21066 and 21066A were deliberately designed using a lower-cost PGA package,<br>
which reduces the maximum operating speed for several reasons:<br>
<p>
    Given DECchip 21066 package cost constraints, designers ruled out <br>
    several package features used in previous designs, notably the <br>
    DECchip 21064 design. For example, on-package decoupling <br>
    capacitors were considered too expensive, since they would have <br>
    added approximately 50 percent to the package cost. To limit the <br>
    package size, the number of available package pins was <br>
    constrained to 287. Specifically, the number of package supply <br>
    pins was reduced to 66 percent of the number implemented on the <br>
    DECchip 21064 microprocessor. The number of internal package <br>
    supply planes was reduced from four to two. Looser tolerances on <br>
    internal package geometry allow the DECchip 21066 packages to be <br>
    manufactured in the package vendors' less-costly process lines; <br>
    however, less-than-optimal supply routing results.<br>

<i>&gt; Therefore, you in most cases have a chip capable of running a good 10% above</i><br>
<i>&gt; the intended clock speed listed on the top of the chip.</i><br>
<p>
And with no practical way to verify it.<br>
<p>
I notice that you did not take up my previous challenge to explain exactly<br>
what testing DCG performs to verify that the chip won't experience subtle<br>
errors due to overclocking.  If the chips truly have such good yields at<br>
higher clock rates over the full range of operating specifications, one would<br>
think they would want to sell that speed grade (for a premium price, of<br>
course).<br>
<p>
My new challenge to you is even simpler:  provide us with a contact inside<br>
Digital who is willing to state for the record that Digital's Alpha chips<br>
will operate reliably at 110% of the rated clock speed.<br>

<p>
Until you are able to satisfy one of my challenges, I continue to believe that<br>
the analogy by Randy Parry was quite apt and relevant.  There may certainly be<br>
more than 1000 overclocked systems in the field, but there is no evidence to<br>
support your claim of solid reliability, other than the anecdotal evidence<br>
that you apparently haven't gotten complaints.  All this proves is that any<br>
errors which occur are subtle and/or somewhat infrequent, which quite frankly<br>
does not inspire much confidence.<br>
