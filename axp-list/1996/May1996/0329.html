     I'm a newbie to Alpha programming, and I often feel lost in it... For sure it<br>
   is part because I am french and Slackware-addicted :-), but the information<br>
   seems to me more private than on Intel : you must *purchase* the technical<br>
   documentation from Digital ! And the FAQ's seem slim to me : what is a PALcode<br>
   ? And why does Milo need to be rebuilt as often as the kernel ? And how is the<br>
   limit between Milo and the kernel set ? And why must we wait for Digital to<br>
   implement it's own version of ELF instead of working with them on that topic<br>
   ?...<br>
<p>
     Does it have to do with DEC compatibility ? Well, I think that if Linux/Alpha<br>
   chooses to enforce Digital Unix compatibility, this means that Linux<br>
   programmers choose to satisfy their clients prior to themselves -- which was<br>
   never the case before. This will bring it further and further from the original<br>
   "Linux attitude". See the people posting on this list : no newbies around, only<br>
   kernel/libc/Fortran/gcc/hardware hackers ! Where are the happy Sunsite disk<br>
   fillers ?<br>
<p>
I would like to put things in some perspective here. You are saying<br>
that Intel/Slackware environment is easy compared to Alpha stuff---but<br>
this is only because they are way up there on the maturity curve.<br>
Linux on Intel dates back to a prehistoric 1992; Slackware appeared<br>
towards the end of 1993. Actually, for some time there was NO compiled<br>
distribution; one bootstrapped a Linux system by cross-compiling the<br>
kernel, shell and the compiler, and assembling all the source packages and<br>
compiling them in turn. It was a big development when binary<br>
distributions appeared (MCC, SLS---remember those?). Booting Linux<br>
from the hard disk was a black art (shoelace was one appropriately<br>
named package); then, LILO appeared and things were easy ever since.<br>
<p>
Consider that (thanks to Jim Paradis' Blade and RedHat folks) Alpha<br>
had a binary package early on. The boot problems are due mostly to a<br>
large variety in Alpha hardware designs (jensen != NoName != Mustang<br>
!= Cabriolet != EB164 != UDB etc.);  compare this to a mostly uniform<br>
Wintel/BIOS environment. I don't think you can blame anyone for lack<br>
of 'Linux attitude'---it is just that the problems are hard and we are<br>
still early on the curve. I bet you that 3 years from now Alpha Linux<br>
will be as easy as your Slackware today.<br>
