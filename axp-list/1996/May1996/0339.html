<i>&gt;  The respective lengths of our messages and the arguments developped therein</i><br>
<i>&gt;may be summed up in a few words : you are a professionnal and I am a 20-year</i><br>
<i>&gt;old student.</i><br>
<p>
Well, I do some programming for money, and I try to do professional-<br>
quality programming even when doing it for free, but....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You foresee very far in the future, and I am only concerned in my</i><br>
<i>&gt;immediate pleasure,</i><br>
<p>
...surely winning you many new friends on this list by admitting that<br>
(sorry, I couldn't resist that editorial ;-)...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(unfortunately ?) consisting in lots of NIH, and a</i><br>
<i>&gt;delicious sensation of domination over the Machine by understanding the least</i><br>
<i>&gt;detail of it's behaviour.</i><br>
<p>
Ah, this I understand quite well!  I certainly agree with the<br>
latter aspect.  Keep in mind I have a very healthy amount of NIH<br>
in my own strange little brain as well....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You are ready to make balanced compromises, but I am</i><br>
<i>&gt;an idealist : I take GPL and POSIX for divine speech, and I want *all* the</i><br>
<i>&gt;knowledge (software and documentation) for $0 (not $50, not $1 -- please</i><br>
<i>&gt;remember that I am a french student and that dollars are expensive to me :-).</i><br>
<i>&gt;And I am ready to drive Linux into an economical dead end (just like the Amiga,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the comparison was right) or to damage its future in any way if for the sake of</i><br>
<i>&gt;code beauty.</i><br>
<p>
It's not so much that _I_ am ready to make balanced compromises --<br>
I'm not much one for that.  I prefer unbalanced collaborations.<br>
Compromise is the result of lesser minds agreeing on non-violent<br>
ways to resolve real problems.  ;-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Of course, this attitude undergoes all sorts of criticisms. But consider this</i><br>
<i>&gt;point : were the first Linux developpers professionnal ? Of course they were</i><br>
<i>&gt;not newbies... And of course the software has gone professionnal since 0.99;</i><br>
<i>&gt;but did you take into account that the Linux developpers are getting older too</i><br>
<i>&gt;? I am running Slackware 3.0 and I am happy (even ideologically happy) with it</i><br>
<i>&gt;since there are still jokes in the code (try a "strings -8</i><br>
<i>&gt;/usr/src/linux/vmlinux" : very impressive :-), that's what I like.</i><br>
<p>
That's great!  No, the first Linux developers weren't pros, per se,<br>
but it depends on how you define that.  E.g. at what point in my<br>
lifetime did I become a professional programmer?  I would have a hard<br>
time answering this.<br>
<p>
I think part of what makes a useful definition of a "pro" in this<br>
area would be "a programmer who writes code that is usable by a<br>
group of people in which no more than a minority needs to know as much<br>
as the programmer does about the code".  Certainly, the question of<br>
getting paid or not doesn't help as much nowadays....<br>
<p>
In that sense, I've been a "pro" since I was about 10, and perhaps in<br>
that sense, I'd probably never fit your idea of an ideal Linux kernel<br>
hacker.<br>
<p>
But, the point of my message was not to say "You are wrong, Dominique,<br>
everything's just fine", rather "Here are several reasons things are<br>
the way they are, I happen to think they are, on the whole, positive,<br>
even if a little is lost here or there".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I don't exclude professionnal programming from the "Linux attitude", and I</i><br>
<i>&gt;apologize if you thought I did. But except from the very root of the Linux</i><br>
<i>&gt;system (kernel, netkit and GNU software), all the programs available for free</i><br>
<i>&gt;under Linux are written by *newbies*, who don't happen to use autoconf but</i><br>
<i>&gt;prefer Makefile-configured #ifdef's (if any :-). And I like the incorrectnesses</i><br>
<i>&gt;which often arise in the code I recompile : they aren't the result of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;incurable incompetence of people designing or coding just to make MONEY, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;the youthful deeds of people hungry to learn more. I don't prefer Slackware to</i><br>
<i>&gt;RedHat because it's smaller, but because of the "satan, snake, gonzo" story :-)</i><br>
<i>&gt;and because you get 6x more CD's for 6x less bucks (at least in France).</i><br>
<p>
That's all fine and well, but once newbies do learn more about doing<br>
a "pro" job (under my definition), do you really want them to not use<br>
that knowledge to, e.g., reduce the amount of email from people upset<br>
with some misfeature of their code (like failure to properly use<br>
autoconf)?<br>
<p>
I guess what I'm saying is, what are you saying?  Are you asking the "pros"<br>
you see doing mainline Linux/Alpha development to ignore what they've<br>
learned over the years, create a somewhat crippled-but-nifty hacker<br>
system, and put up with another several years of email and USENET posts<br>
about their amateurish work?  Somehow I don't think so, so I don't know<br>
quite what it is you _do_ want, but I believe I have a somewhat ancient<br>
emotional appreciation of it that I can't put into words.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  According to this amateurism and idealism, I should have stuck with an Intel</i><br>
<i>&gt;box as you said. But always being an idealist, I don't really want to give my</i><br>
<i>&gt;bucks to Intel who, in order to break the bridge Linux (and other freebies)</i><br>
<i>&gt;just threw across the client machine/server machine gap, sells "only Doom"</i><br>
<i>&gt;no-parity-but-sound-onboard pieces of crap to all my unfortunate friends.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Aren't the AXPpci boards aimed at concurrencing Intel ? So I made use of my</i><br>
<i>&gt;citizen and consumer rights, it cost me 2000 Francs ($400) more, not counting</i><br>
<i>&gt;the additionnal cost of buying parity RAMs and SCSI disks. Well. But it makes</i><br>
<i>&gt;me feel better.</i><br>
<p>
I think that's great!!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  You say you (the professionnals) need a free OS, and that you can't wait for</i><br>
<i>&gt;the newbies to develop it if you want it to be optimally desingned and coded ?</i><br>
<p>
Not me per se...I was happy (sort of ;-) to wait for Linux (or any quality<br>
free GPL-style OS) to be available on some higher-end workstation and then<br>
try to scare up the money to buy it.  Thanks to my (hopefully more "pro"<br>
than amateur) work on g77, an Alpha has dropped into my lap.  (I suppose<br>
I should spend more time doing work on it than sending email, but frankly,<br>
this is lots of fun, and I still like to have fun.  When it's properly<br>
configured and implemented, of course. ;-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Please remember that newbies and cheap Intels originated the Linux movement,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and that if computers had always been a matter of professionnals, the idea of</i><br>
<i>&gt;code freedom would never have made such a long way -- see in what state HURD</i><br>
<i>&gt;is. Digital is not making us a present by giving away its docs : it only feels</i><br>
<i>&gt;the wind turning and does not gain any consideration from me therefore -- just</i><br>
<i>&gt;plain consumer interest.</i><br>
<p>
I think you're confusing several things above.  Cheap Intels indeed were<br>
a vehicle for the Linux movement, and several newbies (who actually had<br>
quite a bit of pro knowledge, as demonstrated by their handling of the<br>
project -- e.g. Linus) did indeed start things going, but -- I want to<br>
remind you -- _that has all happened before, many times_.  There have<br>
been in history _many_ such projects that got that far, or even further,<br>
on real hardware, etc., the reason for Linux getting _way past_ that point<br>
has more to do with the pros than otherwise.<br>
<p>
I remember back when friends at Cygnus first suggested I consider Linux<br>
on an Intel as a machine for doing g77 work on instead of trying to acquire<br>
some kind of "pro" workstation.  They weren't particularly interested in<br>
the hackerish nature of Linux so much as the fact that it was a quickly<br>
maturing, _real_ Linux that made a cheap PC much more like an expensive<br>
workstation.  My interest included much more of the idea that maybe, sometime,<br>
I'd be able to tinker with the OS myself, like I used to do a couple of<br>
decades ago (boy, I miss those days!), but Linux was gaining ground (along<br>
with FreeBSD) back then due to meeting _pro_ needs.  CD-ROMs didn't start<br>
getting pressed just to meet needs of amateurs, though I think the<br>
amateur market is probably more substantial at this point.<br>
<p>
Code freedom came from a very _professional_ basis, IMO, at least the<br>
way Richard Stallman (the father of the FSF and the GPL, if you will)<br>
viewed it.  Without that pro basis, he'd have just distributed stuff as<br>
PD in a marginal state that only other programmer/hackers could deal with,<br>
leaving more suit-and-tie types to twist in the wind trying to<br>
package it for public consumption.  His vision of free software included<br>
the necessary ability for _non-programmers_ to freely exchange source<br>
code not because they modified it themselves, but because they might<br>
want to have a friend (or employee or contractor) do so.<br>
<p>
I don't know what you mean about the Hurd.  I do know the prominence of<br>
a professional GPLed product like Linux has taken substantial pressure<br>
off of the Hurd's release timeline, and I do know the people who are working<br>
on it also are trying to meet pro standards as far as making sure the<br>
Hurd is, when publically released (as vs. the alpha state its in now, I<br>
assume -- the kind of state you should love!!), won't require most of its<br>
users to be as knowledgable about its internals as its programmers.<br>
<p>
As far as your dig against Digital and making docs available, that<br>
gets into sociopolitical discussions that aren't worth pursuing here.<br>
Suffice to say that it _might_ just be possible that one or two individuals<br>
at Digital are personally as excited about being able to make otherwise<br>
proprietary information more public, in conjunction with AXP, as you are<br>
about the idea of knowing every nook and cranny of your system.  And,<br>
if sharing such information was so obviously the right way to go from<br>
a corporate standpoint, that doesn't explain companies like HP that don't<br>
(despite being considered excellently managed companies, even good<br>
"corporate citizens", whatever that means).  Maybe you see Digital as<br>
just following an obvious path, but in the corporate-computing arena --<br>
including all the people who make the chips you'll ever want to use --<br>
they're blazing a new trail somewhat, and I suspect more than a few<br>
suits in boardrooms are expecting/hoping Digital has made a mistake by<br>
being as open as they are.<br>
<p>
After all, I really doubt the DEC employee who drove to my house to<br>
deliver a manual did it solely because it'd improve his salary down<br>
the line.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Back to the primary topic : do we need to follow Digital ? I understand that</i><br>
<i>&gt;it is a guarantee for the future of Linux, and that it is far better than</i><br>
<i>&gt;letting Linux sink and Intel reign alone... But it is somehow a kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt;violation of the spirit of the GPL since the Linux code will always belong to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the amateurs who originated it -- Source freedom is granted by the GPL, but not</i><br>
<i>&gt;documentation freedom, and that's what I fear for the future : Linux/AXP may</i><br>
<i>&gt;become so difficult to understand due to optimization considerations that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;source code would become helpless. It is already the case for MILO, I fear...</i><br>
<p>
I suggest you give yourself a big boost of confidence somehow and tackle<br>
the hornet's nest you see there.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  In the ideal case, this issue should not be solved only under technical or</i><br>
<i>&gt;political considerations : the vox populi should be heared too. But the real</i><br>
<i>&gt;problem is that AXPpci@166MHz owners and EB164 owners don't want the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;thing... And that the Alpha/Linux programmers own the latter. Owning the</i><br>
<i>&gt;workforce, you own the choices, I respect this and fear above all that you</i><br>
<i>&gt;interpret this answer as an insolent flame; I realize that I don't have my word</i><br>
<i>&gt;to say in that story, and that the only alternative I have is to start my own</i><br>
<i>&gt;kernel implementation -- which would be as painful a schism as the GNU/Lucid</i><br>
<i>&gt;Emacs story, if I could only find the necessary enthusiasm to develop something</i><br>
<i>&gt;which hardly presents any interest at all.</i><br>
<p>
You definitely haven't written a flame, not even much of a criticism,<br>
and I hope you haven't taken my responses that way.  Again, I have<br>
an emotional empathy with much of what you have to say, so I've just<br>
been hoping to help you understand some of what _I_ think is going on<br>
that bothers you, because maybe as a result it'll bother you less,<br>
maybe you'll do something positive about it, maybe it'll even energize<br>
you, etc.<br>
<p>
IMO, none of us own the workforce of free-software development.<br>
That's one of its greatest assets.<br>
<p>
I still think your best strategy at this point is to get involved more<br>
in the actual operations of Linux, MILO, and so on.  Surely the<br>
experience of reverse-engineering what you can't find info on<br>
would be very helpful, and we could all benefit from your discoveries<br>
and the ways you might use your knowledge down the road.<br>
<p>
You should know that my own history includes starting out as a fairly<br>
young hacker.  If it wasn't for free availability of source code and<br>
general availability of (often poor) documentation on things, I wouldn't<br>
have gotten my start in programming until a decade or so later, and<br>
never known as much about how software actually works.  (E.g. I learned<br>
about recursive-descent parsing of infix arithmetical expressions by<br>
reading the assembler code for a BASIC interpreter when I was 13 years old;<br>
no way I'd have grasped the beauty of that by sitting in a classroom<br>
being introduced to software engineering as a 19-year-old computer<br>
student, that's not the way I learn.)  I used probably the very first<br>
version of Emacs, because I happened to be doing some hacking at the<br>
MIT AI lab when I got email from rms about this new collection of "TECO<br>
macros" he'd assembled to make editing easier (I tried it out, thought<br>
it was neat, but decided I knew TECO well enough to be more proficient<br>
at that -- besides, these macros wouldn't support the KSR33 teletype<br>
I used from home, so why learn an editing system I couldn't use most<br>
of the time?) -- as I recall, it was email sent to a list, though maybe<br>
it was a post to the bulletin-board system they had online.  Even<br>
back then, I mostly wanted to write programs for people who didn't<br>
have to know as much as I did (after all, I knew so much -- ha ;-),<br>
and so did many of the other hackers.  Writing g77 as a volunteer is<br>
my payback to the community for providing that environment.  Many of<br>
us have both a sense of debt/gratitude for the past and a sense of<br>
responsibility for doing more things in the future, and it's in this<br>
spirit that we work on free software like Linux/Alpha, g77, the GNU<br>
project in general, and so on, in as professional a way as we can<br>
muster given rather limited resources.  Even on my current temp<br>
job doing proprietary RISC-compiler software, if they made their<br>
stuff GPLed it'd be hard for me to not do the same, or more, work for<br>
free, it's all so much fun.<br>
<p>
I think the fact that there's a group of us so large that we have<br>
gotten to where we overwhelm what used to be the predominant non-<br>
corporate computer group, hackers of software for hackers, says a<br>
lot of good things about the progress of notions like community<br>
service in this world, or at least this industry.  After all, for<br>
the first time in history, an average literate citizen of an<br>
industrial country can spend less than 1/12th of his annual income<br>
on computer hardware and obtain incredibly inexpensive software,<br>
with source, that, with not much more learning and frustration<br>
than $$$ software, do all sorts of interesting and important<br>
things _without_ becoming an expert programmer/hacker!<br>
<p>
But, I recognize that this means perhaps the loss of influence of the<br>
purely explorational hacker as the primary mover and shaker of free-<br>
software solutions worldwide, at least, in the arena of solutions<br>
for operating systems, compilers, and whatnot.  I'm just not so<br>
sure that's a terrifically bad thing -- any more than the loss<br>
of the grizzled machine coder as the primary applications programmer<br>
was in the late '50s and early '60s as these newfangled things called<br>
"compilers" took over.<br>
<p>
Personally, I'm happy you've chosen an AXP over Intel as a machine<br>
whose guts you wish to explore -- you'll learn a lot more about<br>
a machine that looks a lot more like what we'll need good programmers<br>
for in another 10-20 years that way, and you won't be seeing nearly<br>
as much really badly designed code (not that negative examples aren't<br>
good teaching tools, but...).  Please don't let a few frustrations<br>
get in the way of your enjoying the new machine.  If you have to wait<br>
to get info on MILO for a couple of months, for example, you could<br>
learn some of the ins and outs of RISC instruction scheduling --<br>
I think every Alpha chip offers some educational benefit there<br>
(aren't they all at least two-issue?).  Surely there are plenty of<br>
things you could learn about right in the evolving Linux kernel itself<br>
as well, maybe you could study the code gcc outputs for code you<br>
think is critical and see how you could improve it...then try it<br>
out as editing .s code and if it is noticable, let us know, we might<br>
find a way to get gcc to generate that better code, or maybe you'll<br>
do that as well!<br>
