I _hope_ that it wouldn't be too difficult if we just did it the right <br>
way..<br>

<p>
Well, that's obviously not true.. You said it yourself: the linker _does_ <br>
need to know about it, so the assembler is wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	If we were to start removing instructions, it means that we</i><br>

<i>&gt; linker to optimize the instructions away.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	The other alternative to leaving ine information in the object</i><br>

<i>&gt; branches, labelize them, optimize the code, and then use the labels</i><br>
<i>&gt; to recompute all of the offsets for the local branches.  In fact this</i><br>
<i>&gt; is probably preferable.</i><br>
<p>
Umm, I really would prefer the assembler leaving enough information - <br>
otherwise the linker bugs will be so horrible to find that it's not worth <br>
it . In particular think about this kind of code:<br>
<p>
	function:<br>
		nop	/* align */<br>
		br  $1,1f<br>
		.quad 0xYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY<br>
		.quad 0xYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY<br>
	1:	ldq $2,0($1)<br>
		ldq $3,8($1)<br>
		...<br>
<p>
Now look at that code: it's one way to pack in some static data in the <br>
code segment. Admittedly gcc doesn't do this, but it's actually useful <br>
for some very low-level assembly where you don't want to have the gp <br>
value at all..<br>
<p>
Now, I don't want to be the linker who tries to find local labels in the <br>
above. Maybe the data values happen to have patterns that match a "bsr" <br>
instruction, and then the linker "fixes" it because there is some jsr we <br>
optimized somewhere.. Uggh..<br>
<p>
So, making the linker fix things up is not only hard as h*ll, it's <br>
actually impossible.<br>
<p>
So, now think of the problem without a fixed assembler.. What do we get?  We<br>
get an assembler that isn't a "traditional" assembler any more: we just get a<br>
smart pre-processor. Essentially, the assembler shouldn't emit runnable code,<br>
it should emit runnable code _fragments_, and then the linker would be free<br>
to pad those as it sees fit. You said the hpux setup did something that<br>
sounded like this (and take a look at the currently fastest single-CPU<br>
machine - it's not made by Digital. It's the HP PA-8000, so they have done<br>
some things _right_, and the compiler is probably one of those things <br>
even though the memory subsystem seems to be quite good). <br>
<p>
We don't really have to be object-file compatible with OSF/1.. Doesn't <br>
the GNU linker already handle multiple different types of segments? We <br>
should be able to link normal ECOFF segments with the "fragment" setup <br>
without any fundamental problem (I'm not saying fragment handling is <br>
easy, but it shouldn't be fundamentally impossible).<br>
<p>
With a fragmenting assembler, the assembler can do something like this:<br>
 - assume that the jump is always local, do a "bsr", but also do a "end <br>
   fragment" at the bsr.<br>
 - the linker reads in a stream of fragments, notices that "oops, we <br>
   can't do a bsr here", and expands the bsr to the proper address load <br>
   and jsr. If it _can_ do a "bsr", it obviously has to know where the <br>
   target is already, so it takes a look at the target, sees if there is <br>
   any "ldgp" sequence at the start, and fixes up the "bsr" to jump over <br>
   it.<br>
<p>
You already showed some nervousness about the assembler creating the .lita<br>
entries, so it seems there are some fundamental design mistakes in the<br>
current setup, and maybe we _should_ be thinking about moving parts of the<br>
assembler into the linker instead (others have done this for similar reasons<br>
- you can do some other limited global optimizations with this same technique<br>
where the assembler doesn't generate fixed code)<br>
