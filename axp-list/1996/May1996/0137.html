Yeah, bit me when I did the gcc optimization, which was why I eventually <br>
decided that we can't do it with gcc at all for the normal case.<br>
<p>
However, my gcc was perfectly fine for stand-alone objects (notably: kernel)<br>
with just one gp-value.  It also resulted in impressive improvements in <br>
kernel size (it was _really_ noticeable - surprisingly much so at first <br>
look, and the gp table shrunk to some much nicer proportions). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; PS: Not to give the wrong impression: the optimization looks *very* promising</i><br>
<i>&gt; and I think it's well worth doing.  Even if you can't get rid of the load of</i><br>
<i>&gt; $27, it still is preferable to use a bsr instruction since it won't have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; data dependency on the load of $27 and since it is always predicted correctly.</i><br>
<p>
Umm. That does help a bit, but not really that much. It's much better if <br>
the linker just gets rid of the $27 stuff completely. It most probably <br>
requires that the linker have all of the result binary in memory so that <br>
it can fix up the addresses easily to jump over the ldgp thing, but I do <br>
believe it would be noticeable for real-life code (maybe not fortran ;-)<br>
<p>
Most functions calls are going to be withing the 4MB window, and they are <br>
going to be to a function with the same gp value (doesn't the current <br>
linker warn you when it has to use multiple gp's? I've never seen that <br>
warning, so it hasn't happened with any programs I've done, but it might <br>
happen with programs I'm not aware of).<br>
<p>
Also note that the jsr-&gt;bsr optimization actually cuts down on the gp <br>
table quite a lot, so just applying the optimization would also make it <br>
less likely that we need multiple gp's per binary (I'm not counting <br>
shared libraries or stuff like that - they obviously have their own <br>
gp's).<br>
