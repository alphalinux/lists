Hey Alpha group,<br>
<p>
The statement was made a few days ago by no less than Linus that continued  <br>
binary compatibility of Linux with DEC OSF images is questionable.<br>
<p>
I think losing binary compatibility with OSF images may be a mistake for  <br>
Linux/Alpha, especially before the compilers mature and the application base  <br>
expands.  There are several reasons why binary compatibility may be a real  <br>
blessing (provided the effort of maintaining that compatibility is not  <br>
excessive)...<br>
<p>
First, the current compilers available for Linux do not take advantage of the  <br>
speed that can be had from an Alpha processor.   With the gcc compilers a  <br>
300Mhz 21164 processor runs at about 2.5X-3.5X the speed of a Pentium 90Mhz  <br>
machine.  Not bad, but this is really wasting a lot of processor speed.  I have  <br>
been running some benchmarks and code examples that show, with Fortran numeric  <br>
codes particularly, the 21164 Alpha sustains speeds of 10X-15X that of a 90Mhz  <br>
Pentium (LAPACK matrix operations with this machine are in the 100-200 MFLOPS  <br>
range).  This is a 3 to 5 fold increase in speed and makes it possible to use  <br>
the Alpha for some really extreme computing tasks. This is largely due to the  <br>
DEC Fortran compiler and its high degree of optimization for this processor.  <br>
Although DEC does not appear to have any plans for selling their compilers for  <br>
the Linux market, if we are binary compatible we could compile a code under OSF  <br>
as a non-shared image and run it under Linux and get all this performance.  Do  <br>
we really want to throw that away? <br>
<p>
<p>
Second, there is a lot of software out there on the net that has been ported to  <br>
Alpha/OSF.  It is not a rare occurence to see an application available for the  <br>
Alpha under OSF, while they are just not there yet for Linux/Alpha.  Some  <br>
examples are the xforms library, the geomview geometry engine, the Sun binary  <br>
emulator and much much more - many of which do not have sources available. Do  <br>
we really wish to shut the door on this large list of potential applications?<br>
<p>
How do the rest of the axp'ers feel?<br>
<p>
Hal Y.<br>
