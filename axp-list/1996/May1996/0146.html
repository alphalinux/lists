<p>
  Eric&gt; 	A few further thoughts.  I am not trying to put you<br>
  Eric&gt; off of the idea of optimizing in such a way that we don't<br>
  Eric&gt; leave nops behind, but I just want to impress upon you how<br>
  Eric&gt; difficult such a thing really is.<br>
<p>
  Eric&gt; 	Normally the assembler will resolve some things such<br>
  Eric&gt; as local branches without the need for emitting a relocation.<br>
  Eric&gt; The idea is that the branch is pc-relative, so there is no<br>
  Eric&gt; point in wasting time and space by telling the linker about<br>
  Eric&gt; something which it doesn't need to handle anyways.<br>
<p>
You know, the reason the OSF/1 optimizer flag is called -om is that it<br>
uses the Object Management (?) technology developed by DEC (this is<br>
the same OM as in AT*OM*, which allows you to do purify and pixie-like<br>
kind of stuff under OSF/1---just more flexibly).<br>
<p>
In other words: it's pretty heavy duty stuff.<br>
<p>
The other tradeoff is execution time: what you can do at assembly<br>
time, you have to do only once.  This is particularly important for<br>
(static) libraries.  Worse: the size of object files is an important<br>
consideration as well.  We do not want to make object files any bigger<br>
than the current ECOFF files are already.  In fact, I'd like to see<br>
them *much* smaller (particularly the debugging info is huge).<br>
<p>
IMHO, binary translation would be the way to go.  It allows you to<br>
achieve the benefits of a smart linking without having to modify the<br>
linker, the assembler, and the object file format all at once.  It's<br>
not for free, obviously, but I like the idea of having an optimizer<br>
that's as independent of other tools as possible.<br>
<p>
DEC is huge in this area, but I think it also means that it is about<br>
as proprietary as it gets.<br>
