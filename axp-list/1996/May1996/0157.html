<i>&gt;Well, that's obviously not true.. You said it yourself: the linker _does_</i><br>
<i>&gt;need to know about it, so the assembler is wrong.</i><br>
<p>
	If you assume the linker doesn't remove any code, then I don't<br>
see how the linker would need to know about local branches.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Now, I don't want to be the linker who tries to find local labels in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;above. Maybe the data values happen to have patterns that match a "bsr"</i><br>
<i>&gt;instruction, and then the linker "fixes" it because there is some jsr we</i><br>
<i>&gt;optimized somewhere.. Uggh..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So, making the linker fix things up is not only hard as h*ll, it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;actually impossible.</i><br>
<p>
	No, it isn't impossible - this is getting close to the sort of<br>
thing I get paid to do in my day job, and I know it can be done given<br>
enough care and persistance.  I will agree that it is damn hard, however.<br>
<p>
	One thing I could suggest however is that if the compiler is<br>
absolutely 100% strict about only putting executable code into the .text<br>
segment, then the problem becomes significantly easier.  I would say<br>
that it is even doable.  The question is how easy it would be to impose<br>
this restriction.  On some architectures, it is not terribly complicated,<br>
but on others it imposes a significant hardship.<br>
<p>
	If it is not possible to eliminate the use of non-executable<br>
code from the .text segment, then it would be possible to add special<br>
relocations to mark those regions of non-executable code in the text<br>
segment, so the linker still knows to do the right thing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So, now think of the problem without a fixed assembler.. What do we get?</i><br>
 We<br>
<i>&gt;get an assembler that isn't a "traditional" assembler any more: we just get</i><br>
<i>&gt;a smart pre-processor. Essentially, the assembler shouldn't emit runnable</i><br>
<i>&gt;code, it should emit runnable code _fragments_, and then the linker would</i><br>
be &gt;free to pad those as it sees fit. You said the hpux setup did something<br>
that<br>
<i>&gt;sounded like this (and take a look at the currently fastest single-CPU</i><br>
<i>&gt;machine - it's not made by Digital. It's the HP PA-8000, so they have done</i><br>
<i>&gt;some things _right_, and the compiler is probably one of those things</i><br>
<i>&gt;even though the memory subsystem seems to be quite good).</i><br>
<p>
	I agree, they have done some things right.  The older<br>
32 bit versions had some very strange features which must have driven<br>
the compiler and linker people crazy.  Things like how their address space<br>
is divided into 4 1Gb quadrants - it is very expensive to call from one<br>
quadrant to another, especially when floating point is involved, so they<br>
added some hacks which basically allow certain functions to be performed<br>
without branching outside of the quadrant.  With the 8000 series machine,<br>
they now have a 64 bit machine, and I am told that some of this stupidity<br>
goes away.   The compiler people from HP that I have spoken to seem to get<br>
rather excited about no longer having to worry about this sort of crap :-).<br>
I have been told in all seriousness by people from HP that you should<br>
consider static linking programs for optimum performance (basically to<br>
avoid the overhead of branching to another quadrant - the executable<br>
is normally in quadrant 0, and shared libs are in quadrant 1 or 2 depending<br>
upon whether the debugger is in use or not).  Anyways, let me explain some<br>
of the things they have done in their compilers and related tools.<br>
<p>
	If you compile a program with the highest optimziation (+O4) under<br>
SoftBench, the compiler itself doesn't actually generate any code.  It<br>
generates an internal representation of the parse tree, and it isn't<br>
easy for me to tell whether much in the way of optimization has been done<br>
at this point.<br>
<p>
	When you go to link such a file, the linker itself collects all of<br>
the intermediate code that is supposed to go into the output image, and<br>
invokes the code generator (the same one the compiler invokes if lower<br>
levels of optimization are selected).  The code generator is able to do all<br>
of the<br>
proper optimizations in order to optimize the *entire* image.  I have<br>
been told by people from HP that there are limits to how large a program<br>
you can link in this manner - as you might imagine the VM usage can get<br>
rather impressively large.<br>
<p>
	Anyways, to sum up, I think this is still a tractible problem for<br>
the linker to handle completely without any help from the assembler<br>
(other than some special relocation types to indicate non-executable code<br>
in the .text section).  It is highly academic at this point anyways, since<br>
I have much more important things I need to be hacking right now anyways.<br>
I guess we are still looking for that elusive volunteer :-).<br>
