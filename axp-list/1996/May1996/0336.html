  Dear Craig,<br>
<p>
  The respective lengths of our messages and the arguments developped therein<br>
may be summed up in a few words : you are a professionnal and I am a 20-year<br>
old student. You foresee very far in the future, and I am only concerned in my<br>
immediate pleasure, (unfortunately ?) consisting in lots of NIH, and a<br>
delicious sensation of domination over the Machine by understanding the least<br>
detail of it's behaviour. You are ready to make balanced compromises, but I am<br>
an idealist : I take GPL and POSIX for divine speech, and I want *all* the<br>
knowledge (software and documentation) for $0 (not $50, not $1 -- please<br>
remember that I am a french student and that dollars are expensive to me :-).<br>
And I am ready to drive Linux into an economical dead end (just like the Amiga,<br>
the comparison was right) or to damage its future in any way if for the sake of<br>
code beauty.<br>
<p>
  Of course, this attitude undergoes all sorts of criticisms. But consider this<br>
point : were the first Linux developpers professionnal ? Of course they were<br>
not newbies... And of course the software has gone professionnal since 0.99;<br>
but did you take into account that the Linux developpers are getting older too<br>
? I am running Slackware 3.0 and I am happy (even ideologically happy) with it<br>
since there are still jokes in the code (try a "strings -8<br>
/usr/src/linux/vmlinux" : very impressive :-), that's what I like.<br>
<p>
  I don't exclude professionnal programming from the "Linux attitude", and I<br>
apologize if you thought I did. But except from the very root of the Linux<br>
system (kernel, netkit and GNU software), all the programs available for free<br>
under Linux are written by *newbies*, who don't happen to use autoconf but<br>
prefer Makefile-configured #ifdef's (if any :-). And I like the incorrectnesses<br>
which often arise in the code I recompile : they aren't the result of the<br>
incurable incompetence of people designing or coding just to make MONEY, but<br>
the youthful deeds of people hungry to learn more. I don't prefer Slackware to<br>
RedHat because it's smaller, but because of the "satan, snake, gonzo" story :-)<br>
and because you get 6x more CD's for 6x less bucks (at least in France).<br>
<p>
  According to this amateurism and idealism, I should have stuck with an Intel<br>
box as you said. But always being an idealist, I don't really want to give my<br>
bucks to Intel who, in order to break the bridge Linux (and other freebies)<br>
just threw across the client machine/server machine gap, sells "only Doom"<br>
no-parity-but-sound-onboard pieces of crap to all my unfortunate friends.<br>
Aren't the AXPpci boards aimed at concurrencing Intel ? So I made use of my<br>
citizen and consumer rights, it cost me 2000 Francs ($400) more, not counting<br>
the additionnal cost of buying parity RAMs and SCSI disks. Well. But it makes<br>
me feel better.<br>
<p>
  You say you (the professionnals) need a free OS, and that you can't wait for<br>
the newbies to develop it if you want it to be optimally desingned and coded ?<br>
Please remember that newbies and cheap Intels originated the Linux movement,<br>
and that if computers had always been a matter of professionnals, the idea of<br>
code freedom would never have made such a long way -- see in what state HURD<br>
is. Digital is not making us a present by giving away its docs : it only feels<br>
the wind turning and does not gain any consideration from me therefore -- just<br>
plain consumer interest.<br>
<p>
  Back to the primary topic : do we need to follow Digital ? I understand that<br>
it is a guarantee for the future of Linux, and that it is far better than<br>
letting Linux sink and Intel reign alone... But it is somehow a kind of<br>
violation of the spirit of the GPL since the Linux code will always belong to<br>
the amateurs who originated it -- Source freedom is granted by the GPL, but not<br>
documentation freedom, and that's what I fear for the future : Linux/AXP may<br>
become so difficult to understand due to optimization considerations that the<br>
source code would become helpless. It is already the case for MILO, I fear...<br>
<p>
  In the ideal case, this issue should not be solved only under technical or<br>
political considerations : the vox populi should be heared too. But the real<br>
problem is that AXPpci@166MHz owners and EB164 owners don't want the same<br>
thing... And that the Alpha/Linux programmers own the latter. Owning the<br>
workforce, you own the choices, I respect this and fear above all that you<br>
interpret this answer as an insolent flame; I realize that I don't have my word<br>
to say in that story, and that the only alternative I have is to start my own<br>
kernel implementation -- which would be as painful a schism as the GNU/Lucid<br>
Emacs story, if I could only find the necessary enthusiasm to develop something<br>
which hardly presents any interest at all.<br>
<p>
  With best regards,<br>
<p>
