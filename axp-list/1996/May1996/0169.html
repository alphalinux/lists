On Thu, 9 May 1996 19:08:34 +0200 (MET DST), Harald<br>
[koenig@tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de]  said:<br>
<p>
Harald &gt;why is times(2) no real system call as `man times' implies ?<br>
Harald &gt;<br>
Harald &gt;for alpha this is implemented in libc using 3 syscalls <br>
Harald &gt;<br>
Harald &gt;	getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF, {...})<br>
Harald &gt;	getrusage(RUSAGE_CHILDREN, {...})<br>
Harald &gt;	gettimeofday({...}, NULL)<br>
Harald &gt;<br>
Harald &gt; and it is not values in terms of clock ticks (which would be 1024/sec <br>
Harald &gt; for Linux/AXP) but are scaled to "CLK_TCK"s which are defined as 100<br>
Harald &gt; in &lt;time.h&gt;.<br>
Harald &gt; <br>
Harald &gt; for x86-Linux times() really is a system call and thus really <br>
returning<br>
Harald &gt; clock tickes.<br>
Harald &gt; <br>
Harald &gt; for DEC Unix times() again is implemeted using getrusage/gettimeofday<br>
Harald &gt; (thanks to Linux strace ;-) but here CLK_TCK is 60 :-(<br>
Harald &gt; <br>
Harald &gt; I slipped into this when I tried to figure out why I get different<br>
Harald &gt; CPU time results for my "benchmark" fortran application which I<br>
Harald &gt; compiled with both gcc and DEC-cc  using the same f2c-converted C<br>
Harald &gt; sources. [...]<br>
<p>
Thanks Harald: I had similar trouble with Linux-Alpha times(`2') some weeks<br>
ago, but I was too busy [?] to have a look in the source code for times() in<br>
Linux-Alpha libc.<br>
<p>
Harald &gt; [...] I've checked the<br>
Harald &gt; correct cpu time output first with "time program ..."<br>
<p>
A wise idea, since the time(1) command itself used to return silly numbers on <br>
Linux-Alpha, e.g., on the [so-called `obsolete'] BLADE_0.3, and perhaps<br>
on the first RedHat Linux-Alpha ("2.1-beta") release also.<br>
<p>
In response to the remarks I made on time(1)/times(2|3), David M-T gave me<br>
the following explanation (along with a quick source code fix):<br>
there was a bug in the current libc [&lt;= .040 ], that would be fixed in a<br>
future release for it.<br>
<p>
So the Linux-Alpha old times story was not quicked off by the modern<br>
headers+libc, by the RedHat Linux-Alpha 2.1 release, etc. ? Strange?<br>
Not so much, I think.<br>
<p>
Your response, David, sounds ubiquitous to me:<br>
<p>
David &gt;  Harald&gt; for DEC Unix times() again is implemeted using<br>
David &gt;  Harald&gt; getrusage/gettimeofday (thanks to Linux strace ;-) but here<br>
David &gt;  Harald&gt; CLK_TCK is 60 :-(<br>
David &gt;<br>
David &gt;This seems the "standard" value.  It's the same value that glibc uses.<br>
David &gt;I don't think there is anything in POSIX requires CLK_TCK to equal HZ.<br>
David &gt;And since OSF/1 uses 60 as well, it's probably better to stick with<br>
David &gt;that value.<br>
<p>
While the Linux[-Alpha] system interfaces do not intend to<br>
conform with the XPG4 specs, we could pick some ideas inside. The XPG4 specs<br>
for times() are (an overview only):<br>
<p>
    #include &lt;sys/times.h&gt;<br>
    clock_t times(struct tms *buffer) ;<br>
[...]<br>
RETURN VALUE:<br>
   Upon sucessfull completion, the times() function returns the elapsed<br>
   real time, in clock ticks, since an arbirary point in the past [...].<br>
[...]<br>
APPLICATION USAGE:<br>
   Applications should use sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK) to determine the number of<br>
   clock ticks per second as it may vary from system to system.<br>
[...]<br>
Issue 4<br>
   The following changes are incorporated for alignment with the<br>
   ISO-POSIX-1 standard:<br>
      . All references to the constant {CLK_TCK} are removed.<br>
[...]<br>
<p>
I don't know if the sysconf() call mentioned above, or similar, is supported<br>
the current libc/kernel of Linux-Alpha. If not, defining<br>
CLK_TCK in the system headers, and giving to it a different value<br>
than the one for HZ could be messy, beacause it's unusual.<br>
<p>
This sort of things could lead some people --since you are not the 1st to<br>
report things like that, Harold-- to DISTRUST the Linux-Alpha C libraries/<br>
system headers, and perhaps also to distrust the current Linux-Alpha gcc;<br>
this is to prefer, as soon posssible, to borrow tools to Digital<br>
Unix when delevelopping/porting applications for Linux-Alpha. I am not<br>
talking of performances here, but of the ability of re-using existing source<br>
code with limited headhaches when porting it to Linux-Alpha.<br>
<p>
About using the Digital compiling chain instead of the Linux-Alpha one, it's<br>
not the legal issues which are, perhaps, the most dangerous, but the technical<br>
ones:  Linux-Alpha may behave unlike DEC Unix in respect to some system<br>
interfaces!<br>
E.g., the definition for clock_t is `long' for (some?) Linux-Alpha,<br>
[see &lt;asm/types.h&gt;], but `int' on Digital Unix (V1.3) [see &lt;sys/types.h&gt;].<br>
<p>
<p>
David &gt;IMHO: avoid times() if you can...<br>
David &gt;<br>
David &gt;     --david<br>
<p>
? I would prefer to use times() than getrusage()/gettimeofday();<br>
I don't mind how times() is implemented in the system headers / <br>
the libc / the kernel... if it works "as usual".  Support for times()<br>
is granted by both SVID and POSIX, while getrusage()/gettimeofday() are<br>
available only on platforms that include some BSD compatibility.<br>
<p>
For the future: Does anybody know what are the Linux-Alpha today <br>
priorities in respect to the compliance/compatibility of its system interfaces <br>
(its APIs):<br>
<p>
a) to be POSIX[x]-compliant, as Linux-Intel is ?<br>
b) to be BSD-compliant, as Linux-Intel is ? [e.g., to easy the port of BSD<br>
   commands/utilities]<br>
c) to be (fully?) compatible with the Linux-Intel APIs ? [they are many...]<br>
d) to be/to remain compatible with Digital Unix (aka DEC OSF1),<br>
   at source level and/or at binary level ? [e.g., "almost" compatible]<br>
d) others (e.g., XPGx, 64-bit interfaces).<br>
<p>
I guess it's a difficult choice.<br>
<p>
<p>
Misc:<br>
- I don't talk about SPEC1170, since I did not yet have the chance? to<br>
  develop/port for such;<br>
- the souce code for the Linux time(1) command can be configured to use<br>
  either times() or getrusage() : it is worthy to read it.<br>
