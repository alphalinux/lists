<i>&gt; This is the intended behavior of all the redhat run mailing lists.</i><br>
<i>&gt; In general, responses should always go back to the list.  Whether you</i><br>
<i>&gt; guys know it or not, there are tons of "lurkers" on every list.  They</i><br>
<i>&gt; won't post, but they do read everything and get tons of useful information</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the questions and replies.  [..]</i><br>
<i>&gt; Most questions that are asked here need to be answered here.  </i><br>
<p>
This is correct, but I don't see how it relates to the Reply-To:<br>
headers. I mean, anybody who's using mailing-lists ought to be knowing<br>
the "follow-up" ( or "group-reply") feature of his mail client. You<br>
can even use it on any other mail, since there will be only one<br>
recipient anyhow.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In the </i><br>
<i>&gt; cases where they are off topic or the author would rather summarize</i><br>
<i>&gt; responses, the author should set his Reply-to: in his header appropriately.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Our server will not override one that has been set.  If the author</i><br>
<i>&gt; hasn't set one, it is still up to the person responding where to send</i><br>
<i>&gt; the reply.  In general, it should go to the list.  If that isn't desired,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the responder should change it manually.</i><br>
<p>
Argh, what do you think is the reason for almost every mail client<br>
(even Netscape!) to have two different reply methods -- that you cripple<br>
one of them too allow us using cut/copy/paste again?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I tend to get *really* annoyed when someone changes the Reply-To</i><br>
<i>&gt; to point at themselves for no apparent reason.  Just doesn't make</i><br>
<i>&gt; sense...mailing lists exist for *everyone*, not just for each person</i><br>
<i>&gt; to ask questions and get answers.</i><br>
<p>
OK, the most apparent reason for somebody to insert a Reply-To line is<br>
to give people the address(s) he wants the reply send to. This is the<br>
original purpose of the Reply-To field (RFC 822). I use 3 different<br>
accounts, but I don't want to check mail on each of them every day, as<br>
I have to pay phone bills for some of them.<br>
<p>
Another point about this is, that I'll use a biff program to notify<br>
me about mails personal addressed to me. I am able to response at<br>
once, if somebody asks me. Other mails from lists get stored were I<br>
can read them as soon I have some time left. I assume that other<br>
people use similar methods to deal with huge lists. Your "feature"<br>
prevents an immediate discussion of issues, but instead delays replies<br>
overnight. <br>
<p>
[..] Just doesn't make<br>
<i>&gt; sense...mailing lists exist for *everyone*, not just for each person</i><br>
<i>&gt; to ask questions and get answers.  Even the dumbest of questions</i><br>
<i>&gt; should be answered *once* on the mailing list.  Why?  Because those</i><br>
<i>&gt; responses get archived and it might save someone from asking *again*</i><br>
<i>&gt; if they can find the answer themselves.</i><br>
<p>
Correct again, but unrelated. Normal behaviour of people that use<br>
mailing lists is to use `group-reply'. By crippling this feature you'll<br>
train people to use `reply-to-author' instead, which will have influence<br>
on other mailing lists, that do it the standard way. BTW, would you<br>
also newsgroups to work this way? Are you missing "me too!!!!" mails<br>
on this list?? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This is the way it works and it isn't likely to change any time soon.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Doesn't mean we aren't open to discussion, but this comes up from time</i><br>
<i>&gt; to time...there are those on the side of the "Reply-To should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; the author", but there are many more on the other side of the argument.)</i><br>
<p>
Well, please put at least a note about this in the welcome mail of the<br>
list. It will help to avoid people making mistakes, like Michael and<br>
me before. <br>
<p>
I won't argue further about this, since the can see at the<br>
number of replies to this, that the list is tired about this<br>
issue. I'll just program my mail filter to delete this line at my<br>
place. <br>
<p>
Bye, Martin<br>
