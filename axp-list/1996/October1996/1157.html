<i>&gt;Note that this case is unlikely to happen since disk drive vendors</i><br>
<i>&gt;probably do their f/w to try and ensure that a command doesn't hang</i><br>
<i>&gt;out forever. Note that the SCSI specification doesn't say diddly</i><br>
<i>&gt;about whether commands can constipate because new tags keep arriving</i><br>
<i>&gt;that can be satisfied w/o moving the  heads.</i><br>
<p>
	Leonard was finding that the commands were haning long enough to<br>
become troublesome.  That's why the special stuff for BusLogic ended up<br>
in there.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Uh huh- this is an area that really always is needing work. Continously.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Are you working on this now, or is this a future thing?</i><br>
<p>
	I don't have that much time at the moment.  There was some talk about<br>
improvements prior to the 2.0 release, but then again we were at code freeze.<br>
There are a few other places that needed fixing too, but I think error<br>
detection/recovery is probably the most serious, and probably the hardest.<br>
<p>
	The general ideas that we came up with was that each low-level driver<br>
should have it's own handling routine for timeouts.  Older drivers would be<br>
able to use a default driver of some sort, but the general principle is that<br>
the top level timeout handler in scsi.c essentially would use a single clock to<br>
time out individual devices (instead of individual commands), and the low-level<br>
driver could call into the middle layer to perform specific actions.  This was<br>
the general plan anyways.  The way the top level was going to be restructured,<br>
all it would really know is that different low-level drivers require timeouts<br>
at certain times, so the mid-layer really doesn't know whether it is a command<br>
or device that has timed out, and it would be up to the low-level driver<br>
to handle it in one consistent way or another.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;	Yes, for a 0th order solution, this would seem like a reasonable</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;thing to do.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Oooh. *SMACK*. Ow. Okay, so it's not the tablet-from-the-mount sol'n.</i><br>
<p>
	Oh, no offense intended :-).  It is a nice solution in that it would<br>
take about an hour to implement and test, so from that perspective it would<br>
be a real win.  Even if we rewrite error handling, it is still a reasonable<br>
thing to do.<br>
