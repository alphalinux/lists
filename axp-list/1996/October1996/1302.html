- this is quite long, so if you're not interested, skip it... it's about<br>
networking problems and installation problems for RedHat on a DEC/Alpha<br>
2000 AXP. - Please tell me if there are other useful mailing lists I can<br>
post this to...<br>
<p>
<p>
Hello,<br>
<p>
I can't believe how many times I've been posting to this mailing list<br>
already. I've had a few hints and tips about how to solve my<br>
-oh-so-annoying-problem- with the DE-422 EISA network card. The end is<br>
nearby, I've been trying almost everything you could imagine.<br>
<p>
Perhaps - for the people who have other ideas (and care)- this will make<br>
it clear:<br>
<p>
***<br>
Called with Digital's helpdesk for a few times. First they didn't even<br>
know what I was talking about. I was asking for the basic port number of<br>
the DE-422 card. Told me it should be something like 08-00-..-..-..-..<br>
"No" I said "that's the network address". Hmm, after telling them about<br>
what I'm trying to accomplish, that I want to tell MILO that I have an<br>
ethernet card on IRQ 5 and a specific port number, they called me back<br>
to tell me the basic port number is 0x1c00. A complete different number<br>
from the ones I got in other manuals. All of them tell it should be on<br>
0x200 or 0x300. I've tried ALL the port numbers sofar and I'm starting<br>
to realise Linux doesn't WANT to find my ethernet card. I don't know<br>
what's wrong. The card should be supported.<br>
***<br>
Installing modules to add the depca.o in the kernel (?) doesn't seem to<br>
be working. I've had so much trouble using it. Last time I looked in the<br>
list, I saw "try depmod -a". That doesn't seem to be working either. It<br>
just can't find /lib/modules/1.3.89/modules.dep. I've tried to install<br>
it, but don't know where I can get it from. Besides, my idea is that the<br>
system isn't installed and configured properly because of the problems<br>
I'm having with my ethernet card. "find / -name "*.dep"" doesn't seem to<br>
help either. The file depca.o doesn't exist. Installation must have been<br>
a failure?<br>
***<br>
The installation wasn't really successful, to my idea, because the 2nd<br>
disk that needed to be inserted gave 4 errors. And after that it didn't<br>
give any errors at all. But, the thing is that when you try to use "boot<br>
-fl "i" dka0" (in my case), I get the query to insert file and/or<br>
argument. Then I chose for "- root=/dev/fd0 ramdisk=1440" which seemed<br>
to be working. But, when I tried to use "boot -fl install dka0" it<br>
didn't question me and I got a different way of loading the ramdisk.<br>
(with &lt;5&gt;&lt;5&gt;&lt;5&gt; signs). And when I tried the last option, it refused to<br>
load the 2nd disk (error: "disk seems to be absent or has been changed")<br>
and the option with 'INSTALL' didn't do that at all. Documents on the<br>
internet use different ways that can confuse you very easily. I'm afraid<br>
some packages aren't installed correctly. Although I have chosen to<br>
install EVERY single thing. I wish there was a document I could look<br>
through, use it, and come to the conclusion I wouldn't experience any<br>
error messages at all...<br>
***<br>
<p>
Is there ANY other possibility? I've been searching on the net on and on<br>
and on... and now I've reached the point I don't know it anymore. I'm<br>
thinking about buying RH 4.0, perhaps that one has got fixes in it? I've<br>
heard the install should be working from cd, is that also true?<br>
<p>
Is there a program (such as SuperProbe) that can scan my complete<br>
hardware and see what kind of cards are in my system? My 2000 AXP 300<br>
doesn't seem to like the fact I'm trying to run SuperProbe, because it<br>
gives memory errors. On this list, someone posted something about that<br>
SuperProbe won't work on an Alpha. How can I test my stuff then? Is<br>
there any solution?<br>
<p>
Perhaps if someone could give me andy URL's or more detailed<br>
information... The most important thing is that I get this computer<br>
ready so that I can use it as a webserver. And, unfortunately, I need<br>
the ethernet card for that.......<br>
<p>
I'd be thrilled if I could be assisted. Thanks in advance,<br>
<p>
<p>
    Maurice.<br>
<p>
<p>
PS. IF I'll find out how to solve things, I will write a full FAQ on it<br>
and post it. But, then I really need your assistance...<br>
