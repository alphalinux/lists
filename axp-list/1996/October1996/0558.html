Ok, folks, DON'T PANIC.<br>
<p>
[ inline: Linus running around in circles and tearing his hair out ]<br>
<p>
Now, it had to be told some day. I have a life. There. I did it. I came out<br>
of the closet. It's sad, it's shocking, but it's true. I even have a<br>
girlfriend [ collective GASP ], and it all adds up to the fact that it had to<br>
happen sooner or later. I'm getting a RealJob(tm). <br>
<p>
[ inline: Linus frantically trying to explain that a university position is<br>
  _too_ a real job, while everybody else just stands around and laughs at <br>
  him. Is too! ]<br>
<p>
I thought I'd be subtle and tell it to the mailing lists first. The idea was<br>
that the mailing list people would tend to be saner than most people who read<br>
the newsgroups and not panic too badly.  Well, that was a theory of mine, but<br>
maddog tells me the stampede already started. Bad theory. <br>
<p>
Again, DON'T PANIC. It's not the end of the world. It's not the end of me<br>
doing Linux. Unlike my current job at the university (and that _is_ a real<br>
job, you just never noticed. is too!) the new job description will even<br>
explicitly say that I'll be doing Linux part time. <br>
<p>
So yes, I'll be in the Bay Area next week looking for a place to live with my<br>
girlfriend and our two cats. We won't actually move there until February next<br>
year or so. <br>
<p>
Oh, did I already mention that you shouldn't panic? I did? Good. Don't.  It<br>
all just means that I'll be living in the US for a while, and making more<br>
money than I am at the university and doing so in better weather. <br>
<p>

PS. Company called Transmeta. Don't bother looking them up, they aren't<br>
advertising. They are in the business of getting the best minds in the<br>
industry and doing cool things that I won't tell you about. Not selling<br>
Linux, so it's not unfair competition in that field. <br>
