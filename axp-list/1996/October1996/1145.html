<i>&gt;Well, actually, not quite true. The key issue here is that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;two machines have to have different initiator IDs. Even non-tagged</i><br>
<i>&gt;q'ing capable devices can keep track of different (single) commands</i><br>
<i>&gt;from different initiators. There are notable buggy implementations</i><br>
<i>&gt;of this (for example, the old CDC Wren IV, would get confused over</i><br>
<i>&gt;which command came from which initiator).</i><br>
<p>
	This part of it would work, but the scenario that I had in mind<br>
was something that even can come up with single initiator machines.<br>
<p>
	Consider a block read request for sectors 100000-100010, followed by a<br>
block read request for sector 0, and then a bunch more reads for sectors near<br>
100000.  The devices are capable of reordering requests, and thus the read<br>
for sector 0 could keep getting deferred as long as requests around 100000<br>
keep coming in.  Eventually the request at block 0 times out, and this causes<br>
a problem.  In the single initiator case, the device driver can detect this<br>
situation, and simply tell the device to complete all previous outstanding<br>
commands before starting the next one (i.e. the Buslogic driver does this.<br>
See Buslogic.c:2560 for example).<br>
<p>
	In the multi-initiator case, the problem is a bit more complicated.<br>
You can have a similar situation but if the read from block 0 comes from<br>
machine A and the rest from machine B, then all machine A knows is that<br>
a single command is timing out, but it doesn't know why.  Since that<br>
host isn't issuing any more commands, it cannot use the same strategy that<br>
the Buslogic driver does (i.e. it cannot force an Ordered Queue Tag on the<br>
next request), and we cannot count upon machine B to even notice that anything<br>
is amiss.<br>
<p>
	The ultimate solution is that the error detection/recovery system<br>
needs to be redone anyways.  It needs to be made tagged queueing aware so that<br>
it works better for these cases.  It may be capable of handling a case like<br>
what I have described, but I still am unsure what an appropriate stragegy<br>
to detect and deal with the above case would be.  There is probably some<br>
command that could be forced out there to order the queues, but ideally<br>
the strategy would depend upon whether or not the device/system has multiple<br>
initiators or not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Yes, I ran into this case, which is why sent the patch to the AIC7770 list-</i><br>
<i>&gt;a change made in August broke that which had been a pretty multi-initiator</i><br>
<i>&gt;environment for some time (bouncing BUSY conditions (setting DID_ERROR)</i><br>
<i>&gt;instead of letting them retry).</i><br>
<p>
	Yes, for a 0th order solution, this would seem like a reasonable<br>
thing to do.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I've certainly done the latter, but it really isn't necessary to do the</i><br>
<i>&gt;former when you have a stable system that:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;	a) Has patchable timeouts (fixed compile time timeouts are a bad</i><br>
<i>&gt;	idea- any number that you pick will certainly be wrong in the future).</i><br>
<p>
	I know.  This is something which could in principle be set on a device<br>
by device basis.  Doing something via the /proc filesystem would be the easiest<br>
way to do this, I guess.  To me this has the feel of a band-aid, but it<br>
would alleviate the immediate problem.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;	b) Truly handles command timeouts, with increasing backoff.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Even with the above being not entirely the case, I've made a pretty</i><br>
<i>&gt;stable multi-initiator system (with the latest &amp;&amp; greatest, after I</i><br>
<i>&gt;fixed the aic 'fixes'). I ran for a 4 hour burn in beating the</i><br>
<i>&gt;crap of the same disk from both systems.</i><br>
<p>
	I think everyone agrees that timeout handling definitely needs to be<br>
rethought and redone.  I didn't realize it when I first got into SCSI, but<br>
that is probably the hardest part of the whole thing, especially when you have<br>
so many different types of drivers out there, so many different types of<br>
peripherals.  I had the misfourtune of starting out with a 1542, for which<br>
there are really very few effective strategies for dealing with hung devices<br>
or busses.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;No. No. No. RESERVE/RELEASE is not the answer. You'd have to do it on</i><br>
<i>&gt;a per-command basis if you're actually sharing peripherals completely.</i><br>
<i>&gt;RESERVE/RELEASE is only really for the HA/Cluster type systems, and even</i><br>
<p>
	I know, I know.  I said I didn't like the idea myself :-).  My<br>
main objection is the additional overhead of putting those commands on<br>
the bus, and as you say, you would have to use it for each and every command<br>
that goes out.  Another SCSI-1 feature that sounded good when they first came<br>
up with it....<br>
