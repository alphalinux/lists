[Note that I'm on the axp-list, but not the linux-alpha list, at<br>
the moment.]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This is kind of a silly error to fall into, but I did-</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I was recompiling gcc-2.7.2.1 (with itself) and the rebuilt cc1 kept</i><br>
<i>&gt;on core dumping on enquire.c.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;After scratching my head and trying a couple of things and (sadly)</i><br>
<i>&gt;pestering Mr. R. Henderson, I finally realized that the problem</i><br>
<i>&gt;was simply that 8MB stack ain't nearly enough (after all, it used</i><br>
<i>&gt;to take 20+MB of stack to compiler mem_rop.c on a sparc, and that</i><br>
<i>&gt;isn't nearly so memory consumptive as an alpha...). </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Because this was set as a hard limit, you have to be root to increase</i><br>
<i>&gt;it, and now I'm happily moving along compiling away.</i><br>
<p>
Whoa.  Maybe this is what I ran into a couple of days ago.<br>
<p>
Not only would the cc1 I was building core-dump doing _anything_ --<br>
even being invoked with no arguments -- running gdb on it would core-<br>
dump gdb!  The closest I got to finding the problem was getting into<br>
where init_lex() calls xmalloc(), and stepping into the call to<br>
malloc() would core-dump.  But, so would breaking on an _earlier_<br>
xmalloc() call and running from there!<br>
<p>
Here's what really threw me.  I knew I had been happily building and<br>
using new cc1's for months, and that I'd made only one change that<br>
triggered building the new (buggy) cc1.  That was adding more options<br>
to the lang_options[] table in toplev.c (via g77's gcc/f/lang-options.h<br>
file).<br>
<p>
I don't understand, offhand, how increasing the size of a global table<br>
(whose length seems not to be directly used by any code in toplev.c to<br>
set the size of something allocated on the stack) could trigger a stack<br>
overflow error.<br>
<p>
But, I do know that when I commented out the new options, the rebuilt cc1<br>
worked fine -- as did the cc1 I got when I commented them back in, but<br>
commented out g77 options that were duplicates of gcc options anyway (and<br>
thus didn't really need to be in g77's list).  So, reducing the size of this<br>
global table did indeed make the symptoms disappear.  (Are these globals<br>
allocated on the stack, a la systems like the Mac OS??)<br>
<p>
I realize I don't, at this moment, know all of the issues, but I'd like<br>
to _strongly_ suggest that if we're at the point of sometimes exceeding<br>
the _default_ stack sizes everyone gets with Linux/AXP on something as<br>
vanilla/smallish as cc1, we need to do one of two things ASAP:<br>
<p>
-  Find whatever bug or misdesign is resulting in too much stack being used<br>
   for cc1 (after all, g77's much larger f771 runs fine on my system).  This<br>
   is unlikely to be cc1's fault per se, I mean maybe the compiler/assembler/<br>
   linker/loader used to build and run cc1 are doing something really wasteful.<br>
<p>
-  Increase the default stack size for Linux/AXP so hardly anybody ever needs<br>
   to change it.<br>
<p>
Claiming that neither of the above need to be done because people can<br>
simply change their stack size is, IMNSHO, ludicrous.  Yes, they _can_,<br>
but how are they going to know they're supposed to do it, when all they<br>
see is a very obscure diagnostic that points to no documentation or<br>
explanation, and even the _debugger_ doesn't work (or explain why it isn't<br>
working)???<br>
<p>
So, don't claim that...let's fix the problem, either by increasing the stack<br>
(assuming it's too small) or fixing the toolchain problems resulting in the<br>
stack being abused by things as ordinary as cc1.<br>
<p>
Yes, I'm volunteering, if I can do anything to help out (investigate, etc.).<br>
I'm running a really old Linux/AXP (part of why I didn't report the problem),<br>
and have plenty of g77 work to do, but fixing this is very important IMO.<br>
<p>
        tq vm, (burley)<br>
