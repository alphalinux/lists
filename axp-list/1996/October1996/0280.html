I made both a new 2.0.x and a 2.1.x release, and they are available on the<br>
usual sites. The 2.0.x is mainly a few driver updates, but also has the pty<br>
bug-fix that people in the 2.1.x tree have already been testing out. <br>
<p>
2.1.2 is the much more interestign one, at least as far as I'm concerned. <br>
This release does:<br>
<p>
 - goodbye old inefficient "verify_area()", hello run-time exceptions.<br>
<p>
Essentially, the old "verify_area()" was a very straightforward system that<br>
checked that any pointer given to the kernel was valid. It verified that the<br>
area was mapped, and returned either 0 or -EFAULT depending on that. It was<br>
reliable, boringly so. <br>
<p>
However, "verify_area()" did have a few problems. Notably: it was slow.  Not<br>
"horribly and inexplicably slow", but it was simply called a lot, and it had<br>
to do a lot of checks. End result: it shows up on kernel profiles pretty<br>
well. <br>
<p>
Now, I tried to optimize it, but it was basically pretty optimized already.<br>
It used avl trees to find the memory areas, and it was just plain a good<br>
implementation. But the bad thing about it all was that it never found any<br>
errors. The things it checks against are things that never happen for normal<br>
programs, and as such it is very irritating to see it taking up almost 20% of<br>
the kernel time under some circumstances. <br>
<p>
Now, "verify_area()" had another more subtle problem, and that was the fact<br>
that the memory mapping that it checked could _change_ after it had been<br>
checked when people used kernel threads (another thread did a mmap or a<br>
munmap). That wasn't originally a problem, as Linux didn't have threads<br>
originally, but it's been nagging me for the last year or two. <br>
<p>
So... Enter the all-new-and-improved Linux-2.1.2. It gets rid of<br>
"verify_area()" altogether. Or rather, the function still exists, but it<br>
doesn't really do much any more. In fact, it does just about the same thing<br>
that it did in Linux-0.01: it only tests that the pointer is in user space<br>
(and it does _not_ check whether the area it points to is actually mapped). <br>
<p>
Voila, instant speedup: the function that used to take 20% of kernel time<br>
under some circumstances is now a inline function that expands to just a few<br>
assembly instructions. <br>
<p>
The downside? Bad programs who mess with the kernel. They pass invalid<br>
addresses to system calls, and nothing checks it any more. Bummer. But don't<br>
despair: we do actually have something that checks the invalid addresses. <br>
And what's nice about it is that it's actually built-in in the CPU hardware.<br>
The paging unit. <br>
<p>
Anyway, Linux-2.1.2 now uses exceptions to trap bad system call buffers.  The<br>
new scheme is a bit more complex to actually use, but it's a _lot_ faster,<br>
and it actually works correctly in the presense of kernel threads (the old<br>
one worked fine too usually, but it _could_ make mistakes, and making<br>
mistakes isn't really acceptable when the whole and only idea of the function<br>
is to verify that no mistakes happen in the first place). <br>
<p>
However, I didn't have the stamina to add the extra exception handling to all<br>
of the system calls, so Linux-2.1.2 is a work in progress in that sense. <br>
It's not hard to add the necessary "exception()/end_exception()" pairs, but<br>
it _is_ tedious, and it does require some care (to make sure everything is<br>
"rolled back" correctly when an exception happens). So I'll be doing that<br>
over a period of kernels, but I wanted to make the basic stuff available now. <br>
<p>
In addition to the exception stuff, 2.1.2 also does:<br>
 - updates some alpha handling. This should contain all the important things<br>
   from the axp-diffs that David M-T has been making. <br>
 - alpha and x86 system call entry optimizations. I now get less than 1us<br>
   system call latencies on my ev5/333 according to lmbench. <br>
 - various minor changes ("a" -&gt; "an" fixes etc)<br>
<p>
David: don't expect all of your patches to be in. I didn't actually use much<br>
more than you machine check patches as-is: everything else is essentially<br>
re-done the way I perferred it.<br>
