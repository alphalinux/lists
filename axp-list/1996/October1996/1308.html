<i>&gt; I can't believe how many times I've been posting to this mailing list</i><br>
<i>&gt; already. I've had a few hints and tips about how to solve my</i><br>
<i>&gt; -oh-so-annoying-problem- with the DE-422 EISA network card. The end is</i><br>
<i>&gt; nearby, I've been trying almost everything you could imagine.</i><br>
[..]<br>
<i>&gt; to realise Linux doesn't WANT to find my ethernet card. I don't know</i><br>
<i>&gt; what's wrong. The card should be supported.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From what I read on this list, that card is supported by Linux, but is</i><br>
(erroneously?) not included in the precompiled kernel by Red Hat. Thus<br>
you need to compile your own kernel[1]! Maybe this hasn't been explicitly<br>
stated yet, as most people here tend to assume that one who<br>
experiences Linux/AXP has been working with Linux before.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ***</i><br>
<i>&gt; Installing modules to add the depca.o in the kernel (?) doesn't seem to</i><br>
[..]<br>
<p>
Personally I don't like modules. I recommend to include it within the<br>
kernel. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ***</i><br>
<i>&gt; The installation wasn't really successful, to my idea, because the 2nd</i><br>
<i>&gt; disk that needed to be inserted gave 4 errors. And after that it didn't</i><br>
<p>
Hm, try to put the images on clean, new, preformated disks, of a reputable<br>
vendor. I had several times problems with this, with several OSs, and<br>
I now only use boot disks once for each OS and version.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; give any errors at all. But, the thing is that when you try to use "boot</i><br>
<i>&gt; -fl "i" dka0" (in my case), I get the query to insert file and/or</i><br>
<i>&gt; argument. Then I chose for "- root=/dev/fd0 ramdisk=1440" which seemed</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be working. But, when I tried to use "boot -fl install dka0" it</i><br>
<i>&gt; didn't question me and I got a different way of loading the ramdisk.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (with &lt;5&gt;&lt;5&gt;&lt;5&gt; signs). </i><br>
<p>
Those are, as far as I recall, OK. That's probably some ESC-codes the<br>
console doesn't handle at that stage.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And when I tried the last option, it refused to</i><br>
<i>&gt; load the 2nd disk (error: "disk seems to be absent or has been changed")</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the option with 'INSTALL' didn't do that at all. Documents on the</i><br>
<p>
The "INSTALL" is used by the kernels by Jim Paradis. RedHat kernels,<br>
to the best of my knowledge, do not understand this option. But if you<br>
use the Aboot loader, and apparently you do, you don't need that. The<br>
'INSTALL' option was a special one to imply the other's, as the<br>
Jensen's console can only forward an option string with a maximum of 8<br>
characters. In case you use a kernel by Jim, be sure to write <br>
'boot -fl "INSTALL" dka0'. I once noticed  the '"' makes a difference,<br>
but that might be dependent of the firmware version in use.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; internet use different ways that can confuse you very easily. I'm afraid</i><br>
<i>&gt; some packages aren't installed correctly. Although I have chosen to</i><br>
<i>&gt; install EVERY single thing. </i><br>
<p>
The RedHat install needs the "boot" floppy, to copy a kernel from<br>
it. It doesn't prompt for it, so insert it immediately after starting<br>
the installation script! In case the floppy<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Is there a program (such as SuperProbe) that can scan my complete</i><br>
<i>&gt; hardware and see what kind of cards are in my system? My 2000 AXP 300</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't seem to like the fact I'm trying to run SuperProbe, because it</i><br>
<i>&gt; gives memory errors. On this list, someone posted something about that</i><br>
<i>&gt; SuperProbe won't work on an Alpha. How can I test my stuff then? Is</i><br>
<i>&gt; there any solution?</i><br>
<p>
Ahem, SuperProbe as I know it doesn't scan your complete hardware, but<br>
just the graphics adapter! I ported it to the Jensen, but since only<br>
S3 card's are supported on the Jensen with Linux yet, I didn't bother<br>
to offer a binary, since the XF86_S3.jensen server can probe those on<br>
its own. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; PS. IF I'll find out how to solve things, I will write a full FAQ on it</i><br>
<i>&gt; and post it. But, then I really need your assistance...</i><br>
<p>
Great :-). One reason that there is so little knowledge about<br>
bootstrapping the Jensen is, that once it is done, you never need<br>
to redo it ;-). Upgrading is easy!<br>
<p>
Good luck, <br>

[1] Compiling a Kernel:<br>
Install the appropriate kernel source RPM. 'cd /usr/src/linux; make<br>
config'. Answer those question. Choose 'Jensen' as system type, and<br>
say 'y'(es) to SRM support[2]. On most of the other options, the standard<br>
answer is OK. Don't include any PCI stuff! Say yes to your network<br>
adapter! At most of the questions, you get an explanation with '?'.<br>
Then enter 'make clean; make depend; make boot'.<br>
<p>
Copy the result '/usr/src/linux/arch/alpha/boot/vmlinux.gz' to<br>
'/vmlinux.new.gz'. <br>
<p>
[2] Some kernels didn't ask for SRM support in conjunction with the<br>
Jensen. Others imply it. You might want to use newer sources. I use<br>
version 2.0.19 right know. <br>
