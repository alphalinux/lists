Not any more. This _was_ the original exception interface I used, and the<br>
theory was exactly as you state: to move the exception handling to outside<br>
any loops and thus make the overhead of exceptions negligible. <br>
<p>
However, reality intruded on my dreams. There were two problems with the<br>
above approach (they were obvious pretty quickly: by the time I released<br>
2.1.3 I already knew I had to change the interface): <br>
<p>
 - it worked on a C language level, and that meant that the exception code<br>
   had to do a lot of state saving in order to restore the state at the time<br>
   of the exception. Saving 4-5 registers etc.. (remember: I'm actually<br>
   counting instructions here, so saving 5 registers is a _minimum_ of 5<br>
   instructions. Too much overhead ;)<br>
<p>
 - it was _extremely_ tricky to be 100% sure that the above kind of thing<br>
   worked correctly in the face of compiler optimizations. Essentially, the<br>
   compiler needs to know about that kind of "longjmp" behaviour, and while<br>
   it is possible to tell gcc about longjmp that also has a rather<br>
   detrimental effect on code generation and on error reporting. <br>
<p>
Also, the problem was that the above kind of interface put the burden of<br>
being tricky on the people who wrote basic kernel code, and that's bad. <br>
Because there is a LOT of basic kernel code, so having a complex interface is<br>
a bad thing because that makes the kernel complex. <br>
<p>
It _also_ had the problem that it still needed the explicit "verify_area()"<br>
calls due to various architecture-specific "features"  (like the lack of<br>
reliable write protection reporting on 386 chips and problems on ARM etc). <br>
<p>
So, in 2.1.4 I changed the rules. Instead of having a complex interface, I<br>
changed it to use a very simple interface that has a hairy and ugly<br>
architecture-specific implementation. But that _implementation_ can be hidden<br>
in header files and a few small architecture-specific files, so now the<br>
complexity is in the right place (concentrated in one place that you can go<br>
over with a microscope to make sure it works), rather than scattered all over<br>
the kernel. <br>
<p>
Also, the 2.1.4 interface is totally abstracted, so I moved the exception<br>
handling to the assembler level: that allowed me to do much less state saving<br>
(in fact, I do _no_ state saving, I just put the information on where to<br>
resume after a exception into a register). It also made the worry about what<br>
the compiler does go away. <br>
<p>
(It also makes it easier to support nested exceptions if I ever decide that<br>
it's a good idea - the original code really couldn't handle nested exceptions<br>
very cleanly at all, and certainly not efficiently). <br>
<p>
So the 2.1.4 interface (and I'm pretty certain this is the "final" <br>
interface) doesn't actually export the notion of exceptions to the kernel<br>
proper at all. Nobody sees the exceptions themselves, because the magic is<br>
all hidden in architecture-specific files. That also means that if there is<br>
an architecture that cannot reliably generate exceptions we can just do it<br>
all "by hand", and the kernel proper never even knows that exceptions aren't<br>
used. <br>
<p>
Now, this all means that you can't move the exception handling to outside any<br>
loops: you simply cannot separate the exception handling and the actual user<br>
access any more. On the other hand, the new code is a _lot_ simpler to use<br>
than the original exception handling, and it's also actually faster for the<br>
case where you can't move it out of the loop.  Quite noticeably less<br>
overhead, actually. <br>
<p>
Just as an example: the optimal code right now for getting something from<br>
user space looks like this (x86 assembly)<br>
<p>
	movl current_set,%ebx	/* get the "current" pointer */<br>
	movl $1f,%edx		/* tell the exception code where to abort */<br>
	incl 984(%ebx)		/* increment exception count */<br>
	movl xxxx,%eax		/* get the value */<br>
	decl 984(%ebx)		/* decrement exception count */<br>
	xorl %edx,%edx		/* no error if we got here */<br>
1:<br>
<p>
That's just 6 instructions to get a word from user space. The full sequence<br>
is a bit more, because it needs to verify the address (check that it isn't a<br>
kernel address unless it's allowed to be) but it's still not very much.  It's<br>
roughly 10-12 instructions (and _no_ loop - just one test) all told,<br>
depending a bit on how gcc organizes it all. <br>
<p>
And eventually, when the exception code has matured, I can actually remove<br>
the "sanity check" code, and then the exception count tests are not needed<br>
any more, so the above shrinks down to just<br>
<p>
	movl $1f,%edx		/* tell the exception code where to abort */<br>
	movl xxxx,%eax		/* get the value */<br>
	xorl %edx,%edx		/* no error if we got here */<br>
1:<br>
<p>
which is just about optimal (remember: the above three instructions<br>
essentially make the whole "verify_area()" rigamole totally unnecessary, and<br>
of the above three instructions one is obviously required even if you don't<br>
check the address: the one that actually gets the value from user space ;)<br>
<p>
Now, the above is the reason why I am so certain that the new exception code<br>
is the "right thing". I can actually _count_ the instructions needed to do<br>
the full test for validity, and go through them one by one and make sure that<br>
none of them are useless. With _three_ instructions I can do what used to<br>
need a loop through the virtual memory management structures. <br>
<p>
Now, because the checking cannot be moved outside the loop, some loops have<br>
to be moved inside the checking if we want to have the best possible<br>
performance. That's why I want to add the new functions "clear_user()" and<br>
"strncpy_from_user()" : those are things where we're currently looping<br>
outside the exception code for no really good reason (as a side note:  those<br>
are also things that generally need architecture-specific functions for the<br>
best performance anyway).<br>
<p>
All the other loops I have looked through that do checking inside the loop<br>
are not really a problem. They do some non-trivial operation on the data<br>
inside the loop (translating a byte with opost processing in the case of the<br>
tty layer, for example), and as such the very small overhead caused by the<br>
exception handling isn't really an issue.<br>
<p>
It's the RISC philosophy: make the basic operations simple, and do them<br>
extremely quickly. Complex operations might be slower, but complex operations<br>
are relatively rare. <br>
