<i>&gt;&gt;I really don't think that is going to work.  It would require that a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;stuff like libc, and libX* use identical data structures etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think it's worthwhile. Anyone else out there have the time to lend a hand?</i><br>
<i>&gt;It would really expand the software possibilities. I can supply some system</i><br>
<i>&gt;resources, ftp and a web site.</i><br>
<p>
	A generous offer, but what is needed more are people willing to dig<br>
in, solve some problems, and write some code.<br>
<p>
	I have been contemplating this over the afternoon, and I am beginning<br>
to think that a conversion utility that could convert an ECOFF binary to ELF<br>
would make the most sense in this particular case.  It doesn't make much sense<br>
for someone to have to try and figure out how to write a ECOFF dynamic linker<br>
and all that, and the lack of support for linking ECOFF shared libraries in<br>
binutils would eventually be a major hinderance.  In about 2 hours I was able<br>
to hack together a utility that could wrap ELF file and section headers around<br>
the ECOFF version of netscape (there - now you know why I really care about<br>
this :-).  I still need to 'convert' the .dynamic, .hash, .dynsym sections,<br>
and add/convert the dynamic relocations.  Oddly enough, the ECOFF binaries<br>
use Elf32_* for .dynamic, .dynsym, so it is mainly just a matter of copying<br>
data over to the larger structures, and then finding a place in VM to put<br>
them so that the .text/.data sections don't get moved at all.<br>
<p>
	WRT the libraries, I have verified that stdio in glibc is completely<br>
incompatible with the OSF version.  Most things wouldn't notice the difference,<br>
but there are macros for fileno(), feof() which depend upon the structure<br>
layout, and the standard descriptor definitions for stdin, stdout and stderr<br>
depend upon the size of the structure being the same.  I am not sure if<br>
anything else in glibc is incompatible, however.  <br>
<p>
	In theory we *might* be able to use glibc, with a compatible stdio<br>
loaded ahead of it via LD_PRELOAD type of mechanism, but this could be broken<br>
with dlopen() types of activity and it would ultimately be cleaner to build the<br>
library from scratch with a compatible stdio.  Also, there are usually slight<br>
naming differences (i.e. __foo instead of _foo) which sometimes get in the<br>
way, and it is often easier just to build the library from scratch with<br>
the right headers rather than just hack around it).<br>
<p>
	Also OSF seems to be using X11R5, not X11R6, which means that we<br>
wouldn't be able to use any of the existing X libraries.  Someone would have to<br>
build these (with a compatible stdio version) before any X applications could<br>
be run.  Also, I grepped through the X source tree, and they also use fileno<br>
et. al., which would be a major nuisance to work around.<br>
<p>
	The long and short of it is that it looks like there would have to be<br>
seperate versions of all of the shared libraries that any OSF binary may<br>
require.  In the case of netscape, the Motif libraries would appear to be<br>
required, so we would eventually need a way to get someone to build both<br>
native and OSF-compatible versions of Motif.<br>
<p>
	Are there any other issues that anyone can think of?  Aside from<br>
performance problems, would the math library routines be compatible?<br>
<p>
	Anyone heard any rumors about a version of netscape for Linux/AXP :-)?<br>
If so, now would be a good time to mention it.<br>
<p>
-Eric<br>
