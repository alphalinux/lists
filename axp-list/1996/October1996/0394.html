I thought for a while to just forget it, but I can't get un-upset<br>
about it.  The RedHat crew in my opinion is doing wonders with the AXP<br>
distribution, and they respond when people ask for help. Half a year<br>
ago setting up and running Linux on Alpha was a black art and hardware<br>
was exotic. Today, people are buying UDBs for $600 and getting RedHat<br>
4.0 for $0--$99, and I hear complaints? Sheeesh!!<br>
<p>
So people are disappointed that their 166MHz Alpha is slower than 75MHz<br>
Pentium; sure, if someone paid $8000 for it (like I did 3 years ago), they<br>
would have a point, but for $600? CDROM is 7 days late? Ouch, I guess<br>
the world domination will have to wait. <br>
<p>
Besides, it would be one thing if complaints arrived from Jay<br>
Easterbrook, David Mossberger-Tang or Richard Henderson, Eric<br>
Youngdale or David Rusling, who probably contribute 90% of the answers<br>
on this list. As it is, I haven't seen them complain. Let's not<br>
emulate a peanut gallery.<br>
<p>
I would concede that the wizards on this list (to which group I<br>
certainly do NOT belong) may collectively be guilty of creating a<br>
somehow misleading appearance about AXP Linux. A novice could possibly<br>
conclude that the AXP release is just as stable as Linux/Intel.  As we<br>
know this is not quite true yet. If you are after stability and ease<br>
of installation, and don't want to spend time understanding and fixing<br>
things, buy a Pentium!<br>
<p>
I don't want to be apologetic for the bugs and problems---I hope (and,<br>
based on past performance, expect) that the bugs will be<br>
fixed. Perhaps even some amount of exposure might be helpful to<br>
nudge things along :^). It is just the attitude that I mind.<br>
<p>
Three cheers to the AXP wizards!<br>
