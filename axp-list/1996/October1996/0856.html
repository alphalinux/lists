<i>&gt;We have done our homework, and I know that there are 423 people on </i><br>
<i>&gt;axp-list. If every one of them bought Applix, we'd approach breaking</i><br>
<i>&gt;even on the port (and manuals, publicity, stocking charges, boxes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;CDs, etc). </i><br>
<p>
That is, of course, if you simply add up the revenue you get from <br>
selling Applixware/AXP. <br>
<p>
Now, I think at least with RedHat Linux, there is a certain amount of<br>
revenue on the Intel side you only make because you also provide ALPHA<br>
and or Sparc versions. The main reason that my Pentium is running RedHat<br>
is that my ALPHA is running RedHat, and I like to keep it nice and<br>
consistent.<br>
<p>
Similarly, there is probably people out there who will standardize their<br>
Intel machines on whatever office software becomes available for ALPHA<br>
first --- be that StarOffice, the WordPerfect suite or Applixware.<br>
And considering the significant cost of well-performing ALPHA hardware,<br>
there is quite a good chance that these people are in decision making<br>
positions; The revenue for selling Intel versions that is due to such<br>
standardization could be many times that of selling the ALPHA version;<br>
It is still revenue that is directly due to releasing an ALPHA version.<br>
<p>
Also, in my experience porting a packet to many different platforms<br>
(and especially porting it to a platform with different assumptions about<br>
the basic size of fundamental data types, and different C and maths <br>
libraries) will significantly improve the code quality even on the original<br>
architecture --- a typical application contains numerous bugs which "just<br>
happen" not to cause any negative effect on a particular platform and will<br>
thus go unnoticed ---- and they are bugs all the same.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Everyone interested in Linux should applaud making Applixware</i><br>
<i>&gt;available for Intel machines (a market which is substantially larger</i><br>
<i>&gt;then the Alpha market) rather then beating them up for not providing</i><br>
<i>&gt;and Alpha port.</i><br>
<p>
Oh, no doubt about that --- it's nice to have the choice of several<br>
office type applications; The day is very near where I will advise <br>
casual computer users to use linux rather than Windows95. However, <br>
it just doesn't feel right to have this hyperfast ALPHA machine and<br>
still run the word processor on another machine.....<br>
