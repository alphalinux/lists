<i>&gt;&gt;	I doubt that this will work.  None of the drivers currently support</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;having more than one initiator on the bus at one time.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Think again, billybob:</i><br>
<p>
	Since I wrote large parts of the scsi layer, I think I have a pretty<br>
good idea of what is going on :-).<br>
<p>
	I believe the real problem would be if you were trying to heavily<br>
use the disk from both machines at the same time.  It depends a bit upon<br>
whether the devices support tagged queueing or not (i.e. multiple outstanding<br>
requests to the same device).  If not, one host will see the device is busy<br>
when the other one is using it.  With tagged queueing, I am not sure what<br>
would happen, as the queue could get filled in strange ways.<br>
<p>
	If the queue is filled with requests from machine A, and machine B<br>
doesn't get it's requests satisfied in a timely fashion, machine B will assume<br>
the bus is locked up, and start trying to unjam it - typically this would<br>
involve either BUS DEVICE RESET or BUS RESET.  This is likely to severely screw<br>
up machine A, since it would appear to that machine like it's requests timed<br>
out (when in fact they were dropped if the reset used cleared the device), and<br>
then machine A would start trying to reset the bus in order to clear the<br>
condition...<br>
<p>
	To eliminate this possibility, one would need to fix things so that<br>
each host had knowledge of the other one, so that it could make allowances<br>
for the problems.  Ideally the two hosts could communicate (provided that<br>
you could put them in target mode), to swap notes about what devices are<br>
in use and what devices are busy, but this would require a fairly complicated<br>
interaction.<br>
<p>
	A simpler solution would be to make use of a feature of SCSI that was<br>
designed for exactly this case.  You can 'reserve' a device, such that any<br>
other hosts on the bus would find out that the device is busy.  I would<br>
hesitate to use this in the normal case because it adds additional overhead to<br>
command processing, but it would probably be the easiest solution to implement.<br>
