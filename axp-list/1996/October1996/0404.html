He has a point, you know. It's one thing to download Red Hat distribution,<br>
on get it on Infomagic CD for $25, and quite another to pay $100 for it. In<br>
my personal experience I once tried calling them for a support question, and<br>
also sent email. I gave all the info on registration ( this was a purchased<br>
RedHat 3.03 CD) and it took 8 days before there was any reply. This reply, I<br>
might add, was less than useful. I ended up getting my support form others<br>
on the list, notably Jay. We seem to get our support from others on this<br>
list, notably the DEC guys. RedHat is supplying very little of this.<br>
On another hand, I suppose that they can not be really selling all that many<br>
copies of AXP Linux, so their resources are limited.<br>
Finally, until recently AXP  Linux was a very small base of users. The UDB<br>
blowout vastly increased the number, and I expect they are fielding a lot<br>
more calls than they expected.<br>
