	Sorry for taking so long to reply, but I've hardly read my e-mail<br>
for over a week and am catching up this weekend.  That said, thank you,<br>
thank you, thank you for looking at this.  I think these watchdog timers<br>
are *REALLY* usefull little gadgets and would really like to see them work<br>
on alpha.  I'm willing to do whatever I can, to the limits of my ability,<br>
to help get this working.  I was even thinking of writing a mini-howto<br>
about it if I finally figure it all out. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; "Scott D. Webster" said:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 	I've been trying to get a watchdog timer board running in a EB164</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to no avail.  I was wondering if I could entice any of you system</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; programmer guru types to take a peak at the code and see if you find</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; anything that would suggest that it just wont work on an alpha.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; driver code is in linux/drivers/char/wdt.c.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Since it just uses inb/outb, it should be fine. Did you check the card</i><br>
<i>&gt; configuration versus the driver configuration? There's some comments in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the code that lead me to believe you have to manually configure the driver</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the jumper settings (?) on the card, ie IRQ and IO base.</i><br>
<p>
	Well, I actually did it kind of backwards.  I set the card to<br>
match the default driver settings of IRQ 14, ADDR 0x240.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; 	Linux just doesn't seem to know that either the driver or the card</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; exists.  I'd think I should at least get an error message if the driver</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; initialization was crapping out on boot up.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You're correct, the driver ought to print something out if it gets called</i><br>
<i>&gt; to init, ie wdt_init(), even if the hardware isn't present, as noted by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; comment:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  *      You must set these - there is no sane way to probe for this board.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
	I made an interesting discovery.  I tried compiling w/ the<br>
software only option and everything worked fine.  The driver reports its<br>
existance between the ps2 mouse initialization and the ramdisk<br>
initialization.  Writing to /dev/watchdog gives no error messages, and<br>
typing "cat &gt; /dev/watchdog" and waiting a minute reboots the machine.<br>
	<br>
<i>&gt; So, did you try to configure it as a MODULE? </i><br>
<p>
	No, I tried to compile it into the kernel.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Or, did the "make boot" actually compile a wdt.o? </i><br>
<p>
	Hmmm...  I'll have to take a look at that on monday (I'm not<br>
on-site right now).  Off the top of my head, I'd say it compiled it. <br>
Whether it actually got linked into the kernel is another story.  It could<br>
have something to do with the driver not getting linked in for some<br>
unknown reason.  That actually sounds like the most likely explanation. <br>
Maybe its some kind of Makefile or config problem. <br>
	As I said, I'll try again monday and let you know what I find.<br>
And thank you again for your help.<br>
