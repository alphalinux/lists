...<br>
<p>
This touches on a few issues that I worry/wonder about.  First is the <br>
performance of a UDB, 166Mhz..  I must admit that Pentium 75 <br>
performance is a bit dissapointing, but it's not exactly bad.  I <br>
started with Linux on my 386 DX/40 and thought that was cool (except <br>
for kernel compiles, but hey..)  BUT, I do wonder if the performance <br>
could be improved with a better optimizing GCC or something?  I am <br>
extremely happy to see an ELF distribution from redhat.  Anyways, the <br>
$790 I paid for my UDB (and NT 4.0) was certainly worth it--it's a <br>
cute/slick/neat little machine.  And I fully intend to get RH 4.0 up <br>
and running on a 3 to 4 GB drive and start writing code on it.  (I've <br>
always wanted a dedicated Linux machine all to myself.)<br>
<p>
The other reason I bought the UDB is because I read in the Linux <br>
Journal (and on-line as well) that the Alpha platform is just as <br>
stable as the Intel platform.  After 'lurking' on this list for the <br>
past week I'm getting the impression this isn't true.  But I do see <br>
that this effort is in capable hands.  And who knows, maybe I can <br>
contribute!  I've never been afraid of tough installs, <br>
tweaking/fixing kernel code, etc...  Actually if it just plain works <br>
I feel like I've been cheated out of some 'experience'.  But I <br>
certainly wouldn't recommend an Alpha (w/ Linux) to a newbie.  A x86 <br>
system maybe... *SIGH*<br>
<p>
I realize I'm babbling a little here.  But I'll conclude with a real <br>
question.  Just how impressive is Linux on a 433 Mhz (or higher) <br>
system?  And is this sort of thing done?  I'd imaging that the cost <br>
of Digital Unix isn't prohibitive when you spend $5000+ on hardware.<br>
(I've got to admit I'm tempted to buy one of these systems though...)<br>
<p>
Well, 'nuff said.  My gratitude goes out to all the folks working on <br>
this stuff.  :-)<br>
