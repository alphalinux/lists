 Over the past few days the recent kernels that I tried on my<br>
EB164 crashed several times, often just a few minutes after<br>
booting and running X (but not always after a big compile job).<br>
The machine had been running nicely for 6 months with 128 MB, <br>
NCR53c810, S3 VGA, 21040 Ethernet.<br>
<p>
 This morning it would boot only transiently, sometimes booting<br>
OK to Milo, then stopping at the point where the kernel unzips in<br>
memory, or sometimes rebooting Milo over and over.  A few times,<br>
it went as far as booting the kernel.  But I've spent several<br>
hours today rebooting and trying different things...<br>
<p>
 I connected a terminal to ttyS1 and can boot the minidebugger<br>
nicely by jumpering (#11 as in milo.howto). The memory test<br>
("walking 1's") checks out OK, and I've tried swapping memory<br>
with other machines and other sizes (32 MB, 128 MB, 256 MB) so<br>
the RAM seems OK.  I can read the image headers from NVRAM OK.<br>
Earlier in the day when I could still run "fmu", I reprogrammed<br>
Milo into NVRAM several times, wondering if maybe the NVRAM image<br>
might not have held.<br>
<p>
When I set bootopt=1, Win NT ARC runs as it should, but when I<br>
use it to boot through linload.exe to Milo, it stops before Milo<br>
comes up and it goes back to reboot to ARC.  When I set bootopt<br>
to 131, Milo in NVRAM will occasionally boot but now mostly I<br>
just get a printout on the serial port about checking the BIOS,<br>
which normally happens just before Milo comes up.  However there<br>
is often 1 garbage char after the BIOS printout, and when this<br>
garbage char appears, Milo does not come up and the system<br>
reboots through the same sequence.  The boot through Milo in<br>
NVRAM is very intermittent, sometimes working once in 10 power<br>
off/on cycles.  <br>
<p>
<p>
Evidenly both RAM and NVRAM and the hard disk are all working,<br>
but from the irregular boot pattern, it seems like there must be<br>
some mechanical intermittent connection... I have wiggled the RAM<br>
and cache SIMMs and some of the other socketed chips since these<br>
are often weak links in a big system (especially after a few<br>
months).  Sometimes this seems to work, after 10 boot attempts,<br>
sometimes it will boot after wiggling some of the RAM. <br>
<p>
The problems appear to have started after I upgraded to the<br>
recent Milo for EB164, so I've been trying to eliminate<br>
"software" as a problem by going back to the older Sept 6 Milo.<br>
So far I haven't been able to get the old Milo back in NVRAM since<br>
in the current state Milo won't boot at all.<br>
<p>
So it sounds like hardware, but the Minidebugger seems pretty<br>
reliable.  Maybe it's NVRAM, but Win NT ARC runs OK when it<br>
boots.  Is it possible that NVRAM could give transient errors<br>
but then come back OK once in 10 tries ? <br>
<p>
Anybody have some advice on this ?<br>
<p>
Ideas about what to try or what the problem most likely is ?<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
