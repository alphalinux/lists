<i>&gt; [snip] In about 2 hours I was able</i><br>
<i>&gt; to hack together a utility that could wrap ELF file and section headers around</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ECOFF version of netscape (there - now you know why I really care about</i><br>
<i>&gt; this :-).</i><br>
<p>
I suspect this is why most people are interested in Digital Unix compatable<br>
shared libs.  However, before we attempt to rewrite the DU libs, perhaps we<br>
should investigate possibility of getting Digital to make licenses for <br>
these libraries available at a reasonable cost.  After all, the only thing<br>
you are going to need the DU libs for is to run commercial software, so<br>
I don't think the idea of paying for them is inherently unlinuxlike.<br>
<p>
What I would really like to talk about though is Digitals plans for ELF,<br>
and I must admit that these are really questions since I have no idea<br>
what those plans are.  Right now we need the DU libs because there are<br>
DU applications that are not available for Linux.  I suspect that in the<br>
future there will be Linux applications that are not available for DU (Word<br>
Perfect comes to mind as a potential example).  If this happens I think it<br>
would be benificial for both Linux and Digital Unix if their applications<br>
were interchangable.  I know that Jon Hall has talked about making a Linux<br>
environment under Digital Unix, and that by itself would suit the needs of<br>
Digital.  However what I would really like to see when Digital moves to ELF<br>
(is that planned), is that the libs be interchangable.  The only advantage<br>
I can see in this for Digital is that it might allow them to leverage<br>
some of the work done by the Linux community.  The disadvantages I can see<br>
for Digital would be potential incompabilities with existing DU application<br>
source code, and copyright problems.  Could anyone from Digital comment<br>
on any of this?<br>
<p>
I would like to cc Jon Hall, but I have lost his email address :-(  If<br>
someone from Digital reads this, I would appreciate you bouncing him a<br>
copy.<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
Jim<br>
