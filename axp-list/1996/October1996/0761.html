<i>&gt;I really don't think that is going to work.  It would require that a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt;stuff like libc, and libX* use identical data structures etc.</i><br>
<p>
	This sounds a lot like the challenges we faced when we wanted to be<br>
able to run SVr4 binaries under Intel Linux.<br>
<p>
	Given that the machine is basically syscall compatible, you basically<br>
don't need to mess with the kernel at all.  This was the first challenge<br>
we faced (the SCO binaries and SVr4 binaries use a very similar interface,<br>
so to run static linked SCO binaries the kernel end of things needed to be<br>
done anyways).<br>
<p>
	The libraries aren't really that big of a problem..  The problem is<br>
that you need to have a publicly available dynamic loader that is ECOFF<br>
compatible where none currently exists, and for this, someone needs to sit down<br>
with the ECOFF documentation and a bunch of ECOFF libraries and figure out<br>
exactly what is needed.<br>
<p>
	Technically, the next step is to fix binutils so that it can build OSF<br>
shared libraries, but this is no 100% required, at least to start with.  When I<br>
first started with the SVr4 stuff, I was able to bootstrap things using the<br>
SVr4 linker running under Linux.  Yeah, you need the license, but if you<br>
already have it, you probably should be able to bootstrap things in this way.<br>
If everything else falls into place, then yes, you would eventually need to<br>
fix binutils so that you can generate an OSF shared library.<br>
<p>
	Once you have a dynamic loader, the next step is to come up with<br>
a libc that works.  When we did the SVr4 stuff, the hardest bit was stdio,<br>
since it was basically pretty ancient compared to anything else we had<br>
ever used.  Someone sat down and wrote a stdio implementation that was SVr4<br>
compliant (and interestingly enough it outperforms the current versions).<br>
<p>
	The main place you are limited in terms of the stdio implementation<br>
are in that stdio.h defines a bunch of macros to operate on FILE * structures,<br>
and whatever you use must be compatible.  If OSF doesn't use macros but uses<br>
functions instead, then you have no problems at all in this area.<br>
<p>
	If someone considers this a worthwhile project, I would be happy<br>
to give the benefit of my experience.  If I were to attempt to do it myself,<br>
it would probably take far too long as I have too many other things I am<br>
trying to do.  I do have access to OSF at the office, so I could poke around<br>
on my own if I really needed to.<br>
<p>
-Eric<br>
<p>
	In passing, I want to toss out one other idea.  It *may* be<br>
theoretically possible to convert an OSF binary to ELF format.  Internally<br>
they aren't that much different in a number of places, so it might be possible<br>
to do this.  If this can be done, then the need for a publicly available loader<br>
can be finessed, and all you would need would be the libraries.<br>
