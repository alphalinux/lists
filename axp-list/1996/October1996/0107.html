<p>
===========================================================================<br>
<p>
October 3, 1996<br>
<p>
Durham, NC -- Red Hat Software, Inc. is pleased to announce the<br>
availability of Red Hat Linux release 4.0 for Intel, Alpha and Sparc<br>
computers.  This release is the first synchronized release of *any*<br>
operating system for these three platforms, and represents a huge leap<br>
in reducing your administrative and support costs for your<br>
heterogeneous network.  This release offers many substantial<br>
improvements over previous releases, including additional hardware<br>
support, simplified installation, rewritten network configuration<br>
tools, dramatic performance improvements, and many more.<br>
<p>
NEW FEATURES IN RED HAT LINUX 4.0<br>
---------------------------------<br>
<p>
. Modular 2.0.18 kernel.<br>
  One kernel for all hardware, support for much more hardware. <br>
  Kernel is distributed as an RPM package.  This means that to upgrade<br>
  the kernel you only need to upgrade the kernel RPM package, which is<br>
  just a single command.<br>
<p>
. Only one installation floppy! <br>
  Two for PCMCIA and FTP installs.<br>
  Both floppies are included in the Official Red Hat Linux/Intel<br>
  boxed set product.<br>
<p>
. Easier installation. <br>
  Smarter network configuration, full "cancel" ability, simpler package<br>
  selection, package descriptions available during install, much faster.<br>
<p>
. New version of RPM.<br>
  RPM 2.2.5 includes dependencies, improved PGP/MD5/size signature<br>
  capability, dependencies, more powerful querying, dependencies,<br>
  improved multi- arch/os handling, dependencies, relocatable packages,<br>
  dependencies, support for building and installing packages as non-root.<br>
  Did I mention dependencies?<br>
<p>
. Improved X Windows support.<br>
  Easier X Windows configuration.  Just pick your video card and<br>
  monitor from the provided lists and you are done.<br>
  Latest MetroLink X server 3.1.2 (Only available with the Official<br>
  Red Hat Linux/Intel boxed set.)<br>
<p>
. Expanded Red Hat Linux User's Guide.<br>
  236 pages of installation and configuration information.<br>
  Expanded coverage of the control-panel tools.<br>
  Includes MetroLink X server configuration information.<br>
  The User's Guide is now available via FTP under the same terms<br>
  as the LDP documentation!  It is also browsable on our web site!<br>
<p>
. Improved network configuration.<br>
  New graphical network configuration control panel tool.  Allows for<br>
  simple configuration of PPP and SLIP network connections.  Makes it<br>
  simple to move your machine between networks, add ethernet cards, etc.<br>
<p>
. Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM).<br>
  PAM is used throughout for increased system security and configurability.<br>
  Shadow password support (and groundwork for future support of "long"<br>
  passwords, MD5 passwords, and other authentication schemes).<br>
<p>
. Red Baron secure web browser.<br>
  Supports forms, frames, SSL, SET.  Faster than Netscape!<br>
  (Only available on Official Red Hat Linux/Intel boxed set.)<br>
<p>
. Upgrades and Fixes.<br>
  Over 180 updated packages, and over 60 new packages.  The full package<br>
  list is available at <a href="http://www.redhat.com">http://www.redhat.com</a>.<br>
  Many, many, many security fixes -- most of which are not available<br>
  on other UNIX/Linux systems.<br>
<p>
===========================================================================<br>
<p>
FEATURES OF RED HAT LINUX 4.0<br>
-----------------------------<br>
<p>
* Installation<br>
<p>
Our third generation installation system is easier to use than ever.<br>
By presenting simple fill in the blank forms, and applying intelligent<br>
automation to network, package, and module configuration, the system<br>
relieves you of the most tedious and most troublesome aspects of<br>
installation.  Installation is supported via CD-ROM, NFS, FTP, hard<br>
drive partition, and has seamless PCMCIA support.<br>
<p>
* Package Management<br>
<p>
The RPM package system is designed to be powerful yet easy to use.<br>
These design features, along with smart config file handling across<br>
package upgrades, "shared" file handling, documentation searching<br>
support, package installation via FTP, dependencies, and powerful<br>
querying, make RPM the most advanced package system available.<br>
<p>
With our graphical package manager Glint you can track every package<br>
installed on your system, and all packages available on the CD-ROM.<br>
You can examine package descriptions and file contents before you<br>
install them.  With a few mouse button clicks you can install,<br>
uninstall, list and verify all installed packages.  No other<br>
installation system comes close.<br>
<p>
* Configuration Tools<br>
<p>
The Red Hat control panel tools cover configuration of your network,<br>
printer, filesystem, users and groups, SysV init, time and date, and<br>
modem.  PPP and SLIP configuration has never been easier!<br>
<p>
* Compatibility between Linux Platforms<br>
<p>
The Red Hat Linux 4.0 for Intel, Alpha and Sparc products are built<br>
from the exact same source packages.  This ensures maximum ease of<br>
software portability between machines running Red Hat Linux regardless<br>
of the underlying hardware architecture.  In addition, your investment<br>
in configuration of Red Hat Linux will pay off on all three platforms.<br>
<p>
* License Terms<br>
<p>
Red Hat Linux is distributed under the terms of the GPL, and is<br>
freely available from our FTP site, and dozens of mirrors.  For<br>
the first time, the Red Hat Linux User's Guide is also available<br>
freely, under the terms of the LDP license!<br>
<p>
===========================================================================<br>
<p>
STANDARDS, TESTING, AND RED HAT LINUX<br>
-------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Red Hat Linux continues to track both Linux and UNIX industry<br>
standards closely.  Red Hat Linux conforms to the Linux file system<br>
standard: FSSTND, and tracks many other Linux and UNIX standards.<br>
<p>
Testing is probably Linux's greatest strength and the origin of its<br>
remarkable stability for most applications, and Red Hat Linux benefits<br>
from this.  The truly open development model followed by Linus<br>
Torvalds and the Linux development community allows new releases of<br>
the kernel, components, and distributions to be tested by hundreds of<br>
thousands of users. Their access to everything at little or no cost,<br>
including full source code, off many sites on the Internet enables<br>
anyone to contribute to further development by not just reporting bugs<br>
but contributing patches.<br>
<p>
Red Hat Linux depends on this open development model.  We post Red Hat<br>
Linux as "freely redistributable" software for free download off of many<br>
sites on the Internet, and we are grateful for the valuable assistance<br>
we receive.<br>
<p>
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has decided<br>
to stop charging for their POSIX Conformance Test Suite 151-2, in<br>
hopes that the POSIX standard may be more broadly applied.  Red Hat<br>
Software applauds the move, and has obtained the suites for<br>
consideration.  We would encourage all Linux developers to take<br>
advantage of this development.  Comments and questions can be directed<br>
to Martha Gray &lt;<a href="mailto:gray@sst.ncsl.nist.gov">gray@sst.ncsl.nist.gov</a>&gt; at NIST.<br>
<p>
A STABLE SOFTWARE PLATFORM AND A RAPIDLY EVOLVING TECHNOLOGY<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Red Hat's software packaging scheme (RPM) provides the reliable and<br>
consistent installation on a stable environment that ISV's are looking<br>
for, and yet allows for a flexible environment for further Linux<br>
development.<br>
<p>
RPM's advanced software packaging features enable RPM packaged<br>
software to be installed easily and correctly on any Red Hat Linux<br>
platform.  Running older software versions on a new release of Red Hat<br>
Linux is generally reliable and trouble free.<br>
<p>
FREELY REDISTRIBUTABLE SOFTWARE<br>
-------------------------------<br>
<p>
Red Hat Linux is released as freely redistributable software under the<br>
terms of the GPL.  This allows anyone to use Linux without restriction<br>
and to contribute to Linux development.  It also prevents anyone or<br>
any corporation from restricting access to Linux or Linux source code.<br>
Commercially licensed software can be ported to Linux while<br>
maintaining the license terms that the author uses for any other<br>
platform.<br>
<p>
===========================================================================<br>
<p>
RPM - RED HAT PACKAGE MANAGER<br>
-----------------------------<br>
<p>
After installing Red Hat Linux once, you will never need to reinstall<br>
Linux again!  Our RPM packaging system is sophisticated enough to<br>
allow upgrading to new Red Hat Linux releases without reinstalling<br>
your system - no partitioning, no backing up all your files, no<br>
headaches.<br>
<p>
Red Hat Linux 4.0 is built on a third generation packaging system<br>
called RPM.  The RPM system features include smart configuration file<br>
handling across package upgrades, "shared" file handling,<br>
documentation searching support, and package installation via FTP.<br>
You can install, uninstall, query, verify, and upgrade individual RPM<br>
packages.<br>
<p>
The Red Hat Software web site, <a href="http://www.redhat.com">http://www.redhat.com</a>, contains more<br>
information on RPM and the RPM-HOWTO, which describes how to use RPM<br>
and build your own RPM packages.<br>
<p>
A graphical package management tool called GLINT allows you to quickly<br>
and easily manage and track your system.  It displays a hierarchy of<br>
packages represented by individual package icons, and displays<br>
progress meters during installation.<br>
<p>
We are releasing RPM under the terms of the GPL and we would like to<br>
encourage everyone to use it to package their software.  You can get <br>
RPM separately from Red Hat Linux from our FTP site.<br>
<p>
PRISTINE SOURCES<br>
----------------<br>
<p>
An important element of the design of Red Hat Linux is our commitment<br>
to the concept of "pristine sources".  Our RPM source packages include<br>
pristine, untouched sources, as well as patches and a control file<br>
which defines the building and packaging process.  It enables us to<br>
work with other members of the Linux development community easily and<br>
effectively by clearly separating and documenting the code that they<br>
contribute from any modifications that are required by Red Hat Linux.<br>
<p>
===========================================================================<br>
<p>
FTP AVAILABILITY<br>
----------------<br>
<p>
Red Hat Linux is available for the Intel, Alpha, and Sparc on our<br>
FTP site:<br>
<p>
    <a href="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/redhat-4.0">ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/redhat-4.0</a><br>
<p>
Many sites mirror the Red Hat FTP site, and may give you much better<br>
performance.  A list of these mirrors is at:<br>
<p>
    <a href="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/MIRRORS">ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/MIRRORS</a><br>
<p>
(Note that the Metro X server, Red Baron and Grail are not available<br>
 via FTP.  These packages are only available with the full boxed set<br>
 product.)<br>
<p>
RED HAT SOFTWARE WEB SITE<br>
-------------------------<br>
<p>
The Red Hat Software web site, <a href="http://www.redhat.com">http://www.redhat.com</a>, contains a<br>
wealth of helpful information, as well as a web-based ordering system<br>
for all our products.<br>
<p>
Of particular interest is the support section of the web site, which<br>
includes archives of our mailing lists, errata, Red Hat TIPS, the LDP<br>
documentation, and lots more.  See <a href="http://www.redhat.com/support">http://www.redhat.com/support</a>.<br>
<p>
UPGRADING AND EXCHANGE POLICIES<br>
-------------------------------<br>
<p>
All previous releases of Red Hat Linux (2.0, 2.1, 3.0.3) can be<br>
upgraded in place (without reformatting or repartitioning).  For<br>
those who want to upgrade, but do not want to purchase the full<br>
boxed set, the Red Hat Linux Archives 4 CD-ROM set is the right<br>
choice.  Red Hat Linux for the Intel and Alpha are both available<br>
on the Archives (Metro X, Red Baron, and Grail are only available<br>
with the full boxed set).<br>
<p>
Exchange and upgrade policies for those who purchased 3.0.3 recently<br>
are best addressed by the vendor of your product.  If you purchased it<br>
directly from Red Hat Software, contact the sales office at:<br>
<p>
phone: (800) 546-7274 or (203) 454-5500<br>
  fax: (919) 572-6726<br>
email: <a href="mailto:sales@redhat.com">sales@redhat.com</a><br>
