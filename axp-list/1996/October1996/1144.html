<i>&gt;From <a href="mailto:eric@sub2317.jic.com">eric@sub2317.jic.com</a> Sun Oct 27 10:10:33 1996</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;	I doubt that this will work.  None of the drivers currently support</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;having more than one initiator on the bus at one time.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Think again, billybob:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;	Since I wrote large parts of the scsi layer, I think I have a pretty</i><br>
<i>&gt;good idea of what is going on :-).</i><br>
<p>
Oh, yes, I know. I've been doing this stuff a while myself.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;	I believe the real problem would be if you were trying to heavily</i><br>
<i>&gt;use the disk from both machines at the same time.  It depends a bit upon</i><br>
<i>&gt;whether the devices support tagged queueing or not (i.e. multiple outstanding</i><br>
<i>&gt;requests to the same device).  If not, one host will see the device is busy</i><br>
<i>&gt;when the other one is using it.  With tagged queueing, I am not sure what</i><br>
<i>&gt;would happen, as the queue could get filled in strange ways.</i><br>
<p>
Well, actually, not quite true. The key issue here is that the<br>
two machines have to have different initiator IDs. Even non-tagged<br>
q'ing capable devices can keep track of different (single) commands<br>
from different initiators. There are notable buggy implementations<br>
of this (for example, the old CDC Wren IV, would get confused over<br>
which command came from which initiator).<br>
<p>
About t'qing: If a target is truly SCSI-2 compliant, it should sound<br>
back a QFULL set in the status byte, but I haven't seen anything in<br>
the current linux layer that deals with that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;	If the queue is filled with requests from machine A, and machine B</i><br>
<i>&gt;doesn't get it's requests satisfied in a timely fashion, machine B will assume</i><br>
<i>&gt;the bus is locked up, and start trying to unjam it - typically this would</i><br>
<i>&gt;involve either BUS DEVICE RESET or BUS RESET.  This is likely to severely screw</i><br>
<i>&gt;up machine A, since it would appear to that machine like it's requests timed</i><br>
<i>&gt;out (when in fact they were dropped if the reset used cleared the device), and</i><br>
<i>&gt;then machine A would start trying to reset the bus in order to clear the</i><br>
<i>&gt;condition...</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I ran into this case, which is why sent the patch to the AIC7770 list-<br>
a change made in August broke that which had been a pretty multi-initiator<br>
environment for some time (bouncing BUSY conditions (setting DID_ERROR)<br>
instead of letting them retry).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;	To eliminate this possibility, one would need to fix things so that</i><br>
<i>&gt;each host had knowledge of the other one, so that it could make allowances</i><br>
<i>&gt;for the problems.  Ideally the two hosts could communicate (provided that</i><br>
<i>&gt;you could put them in target mode), to swap notes about what devices are</i><br>
<i>&gt;in use and what devices are busy, but this would require a fairly complicated</i><br>
<i>&gt;interaction.</i><br>
<p>
I've certainly done the latter, but it really isn't necessary to do the<br>
former when you have a stable system that:<br>
<p>
	a) Has patchable timeouts (fixed compile time timeouts are a bad<br>
	idea- any number that you pick will certainly be wrong in the future).<br>
<p>
	b) Truly handles command timeouts, with increasing backoff.<br>
<p>
Even with the above being not entirely the case, I've made a pretty<br>
stable multi-initiator system (with the latest &amp;&amp; greatest, after I<br>
fixed the aic 'fixes'). I ran for a 4 hour burn in beating the<br>
crap of the same disk from both systems.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;	A simpler solution would be to make use of a feature of SCSI that was</i><br>
<i>&gt;designed for exactly this case.  You can 'reserve' a device, such that any</i><br>
<i>&gt;other hosts on the bus would find out that the device is busy.  I would</i><br>
<i>&gt;hesitate to use this in the normal case because it adds additional overhead to</i><br>
<i>&gt;command processing, but it would probably be the easiest solution to implement.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
No. No. No. RESERVE/RELEASE is not the answer. You'd have to do it on<br>
a per-command basis if you're actually sharing peripherals completely.<br>
RESERVE/RELEASE is only really for the HA/Cluster type systems, and even<br>
then you have to really do things like 3rd party reservation to make<br>
them reliable (some fella up back east has done some modified reserve/release<br>
f/w case where the reservation times out: this allows a really cheap DFS<br>
implemntation... but I really don't like modified f/w...)<br>
