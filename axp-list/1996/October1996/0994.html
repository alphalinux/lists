<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; Mikael Nykvist said:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; With the recent release of programming info for the Matrox millenium, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; a couple of guys have decided to write an xf86-server I thought it was</i><br>
<i>&gt; time to ditch my old tired Trio64 based card and buy something nice, ie an</i><br>
<i>&gt; Matrox Millenium.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now to the problems (and a 'solution' later me and Andreas J found).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1. newest milo hangs (both with digital x86 emu and the free one) when it</i><br>
<i>&gt;    tries init the gfx bios. </i><br>
<p>
I don't think you waited long enough... :-(<br>
<p>
Unless you have the *very* latest MILOs with the latest DEC BIOS emulator (I<br>
think it identifies itself as "2.02-ebsdk", and I'm not sure Dave Rusling<br>
has released them yet), the MGA causes *long* delays during its init. And I<br>
am talking more than 30 seconds here, especially on a slow box like NONAME.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2. newest srm also hangs when trying to init the card (whoops, I started</i><br>
<i>&gt;    to loose faith here..:-)</i><br>
<p>
Not too surprised, its BIOS em is prolly older than MILO's... :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3. arc manages to init the card correctly! Hmm, I thought the x86-emu in</i><br>
<i>&gt;    arc/srm/milo was the same thing nowadays.. Obviously not.</i><br>
<p>
Ah, you're lucky! My old EB66 (BIOS em 1.15) doesn't quite get there, lots<br>
of fuzzy characters, and some missing, etc. Good thing I know what it's trying<br>
to say... :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This was a good thing. Now to boot linux. I setup arc to boot milo. milo</i><br>
<i>&gt; nows boot (and can boot linux without a problem), *BUT* arc sets the</i><br>
<i>&gt; gfx card in some videomode (640x480 or something), and milo does *NOT*</i><br>
<i>&gt; manage to reinit (it doesn't hang while trying to do it though) the card</i><br>
<i>&gt; so the gfx-card stays in the same resolution which results in no screen</i><br>
<i>&gt; output (I can see the screen scoll and stuff, but its not in 80x25</i><br>
<i>&gt; textmode which linux thinks it is..).</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I've seen this happen as well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Bad. Well, because the card is init'd ok, and seemed to work ok, we</i><br>
<i>&gt; decided to just change video-mode instead of re-init the card. We wrote a </i><br>
<i>&gt; simple svgalib proggie which changed resolution (we used basic vga</i><br>
<i>&gt; videoregs settings, and used the fonts we got from dumping them from a</i><br>
<i>&gt; trio64 card. Voila! Works excellent. </i><br>
<p>
Excellent!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So at the moment, we have removed the x86-emu at all in milo and instead</i><br>
<i>&gt; just changes resolution in milo...</i><br>
<p>
Yes, we did that early on as well, when booting from ARC or SRM that we could<br>
trust to do the right thing for the card.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; * Why does the x86 emulator in arc-srm/milo differ?</i><br>
<p>
There's actually 2 emulators available as part of MILO; the original was a<br>
tweaked version of a free x86 emulator, which never did a good job with a<br>
number of cards (Mach84 comes readily to mind, although most S3's were/are<br>
fine). The other is a proprietary emulator done by DEC to be part of ARC and<br>
SRM, and now, MILO. Its not available as source, as the free one is. Now, as<br>
new machines are released, they go out the door with whatever the latest<br>
version of the BIOS em is available to them. There's also constant work done<br>
on the BIOS em, as newer VGA cards come out that make it fall over... :-) So<br>
it's very easy to get "version skew". The latest ARC/AlphaBIOS firmware for<br>
most platforms is available for FTP from: <a href="http://www.windowsnt.digital.com/">http://www.windowsnt.digital.com/</a>.<br>
The latest SRM's are available on the Firmware CD distributed to support<br>
Digital UNIX and VMS, and require a license.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; * Why can't you compile milo as elf? (Tons of stuff about 'relocation</i><br>
<i>&gt;   failed' when it tries to link it, we had to compile it as ecoff</i><br>
<i>&gt;   (ofcourse we recompiled davids free 86 emulator as elf, so we are not</i><br>
<i>&gt;   trying to link togheter with ecoff libs or anything stupid like that.)</i><br>
<p>
That capability is coming real soon now; watch this space for Dave Rusling<br>
to announce when he has it ready.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; * Does any1 have an idea of a "better way" to do it (Hopefully ditch arc</i><br>
<i>&gt;   if possible..)?</i><br>
<i>&gt; * Any chance of getting 'reboot' to work when you boot arc-&gt;milo-&gt;linux ?</i><br>
<p>
This should work now; "reboot" should end you back up in MILO. If it doesn't,<br>
let us know.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Thats it! Now we have just to fix an xserver, an 8M millenium seems like </i><br>
<i>&gt; a waste for a textconsole ;) Keep up the good work guys (and girls</i><br>
<i>&gt; ofcourse)!</i><br>
<p>
Once XFree86 3.2 is released, I will release a set of patches to it, along<br>
with making binaries available, for the Matrox Millenium server that will<br>
be part of that release (but INTEL-tested only).<br>
<p>
I have the server running quite happily now, on both EV4 and EV5-based boxes,<br>
with 2Mb and 8Mb VRAM installed. It seems to work well at 8, 16, and 32-bit<br>
depths, though is not well tested at the deeper ones. And, yes, QUAKE runs<br>
quite well... :-)<br>
<p>
Note that successful use of the server will *require* some kernel patches,<br>
which will also be available as part of a later LINUX source release or as<br>
a separate patch set.<br>
