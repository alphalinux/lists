Heya!<br>
<p>
These problems I will describe might be bugs in the x86 version also, but<br>
I haven't tested that yet. Some of the bugs might be because I screwed up,<br>
so please correct me if you see anything strange...<br>
<p>
System: noname,newest milo from 'test-images' ...<br>
<p>
I did a *ftp* install from scratch<br>
<p>
Install problems:	* name-resolving isn't working (I tried 2<br>
			  different ns's, which I *know* was working at<br>
			  the time being, using ip-nr's worked ok)<br>
<p>
			* I tried installing from ftp.ibp.fr, which is a<br>
			  very fast mirror for me, but I noticed that the<br>
			  install *needs* passive transfer mode, which<br>
			  their server doesn't support. This 'error' <br>
			  made the whole install abort and the machine <br>
			  rebooted..Hmmm, maybe needs some error-recovery?<br>
<p>
Ok, damn, just for finding out I wasn't doing anything wrong, I started to<br>
install directly from ftp.redhat.com (just wanted to see that the<br>
installation started, dl the whole from that server would have taken<br>
days..). Ok started correctly, formatted the partions, got some small<br>
files but then:<br>
<p>
			* Got an ftp-timeout (I guess to many ppl<br>
			  wants the 4.0 release :-) and the installation<br>
			  aborted and yet another time the machine rebooted...<br>
<p>
Ok, started again, and I'm using the ftp.gwdg.de mirror now. <br>
<p>
			* Because I formatted the partitions when I<br>
			  tried installing directly from ftp.redhat.com <br>
			  I thought I didn't need to do it again so I <br>
			  skipped it... Bad move, because the previous<br>
			  install had kept a bad rpm database, which<br>
			  this new install didn't remove first, and<br>
			  ofcourse the machine rebooted yet another <br>
			  time...<br>
<p>
			* I selected *all* sets, except "print server" and<br>
			  "news server", but the installationen only<br>
			  installed 128 packages. Just the very basic <br>
			  packages got installed, nothing fancy like X<br>
			  got installed... (I can send you the install.log<br>
			  if you want to)<br>
<p>
Well, the install now finishes, the machine reboots and everything works <br>
nicely :-) Except for all the missing packages that is, but I just ftp'd<br>
all the packages manually and installed them by hand with rpm.<br>
<p>
Ok, now some bugs in the system:<br>
<p>
	* xload exists in both X11R6-contrib and procps-X11<br>
	* Several manpages exists in both libgr-devel and netpbm<br>
	* /usr/bin/play exists in both sox and exmh<br>
	* /var/log/wtmp is missing (just a simple touch fixes it)<br>
	* depmod is 'missing', but is called from rc.sysinit<br>
	* fdisk's disklabel support is bad, it insist on all partitions<br>
	  starting on cylinder 1<br>
	* finger(d) output is to wide (no need to print the whole 32char<br>
	  field)<br>
	* joe segv's due to an global non-initialed var. This is *not* an<br>
	  bug in joe, it should really work (and it works on x86, and<br>
	  ecoff/axp) so something is broken in elf (ld.so probably). I<br>
	  think Andreas Johansson sent a mail about this a while ago.<br>
	<br>
Oh, and the note about 'disklabel-type' partitiontables in the<br>
RH-4.0-Manual is wrong. It says that the first partition should normally<br>
be swap. This is not the case, the bsd style says that partion 1 (a)<br>
should be the rootpartition, 2 (b) should be swap, (c) should be the whole<br>
disk, and from here you can have whatever partitions you like...<br>
<p>
And at last some suggestions for the install..<br>
<p>
	* Have some selectable list of ftp-sites to install from (ofcourse<br>
	  there should be a 'custom' entry where you can put in whatever<br>
	  you like).<br>
	* Maybe a simple 'ftp-browser' when you use the 'custom ftp-site'<br>
	  because it can sometimes to be hard to remember the exact <br>
	  path..<br>
	* Include minlabel on the rootfs because of the crappy fdisk <br>
	  disklabel support<br>
	* The possibility to abort the installation<br>
<p>
Thats it! <br>
<p>
Now I have to play with all the 380 packages of goodies :-) Keep up the <br>
good work! <br>
