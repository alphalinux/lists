<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Robert Allen Barker said:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 	I am having a bit of trouble installing redhat on a new PC164.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 	Everything goes well and MILO comes up but whenever I do anything</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that casues milo to detect the SCSI controller it hangs after printing two</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; lines, the second line saying that the NCR810 is assigned IRQ16 (which is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; correct and the same as on the EB164). Thats the last thing that happens. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; However, about 1 time in 5 it will get past this point and everything seems</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to work, I can read drives and cd roms, and run programs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This SCSI card wants to be IRQ16 only so I have it placed in the last 64 bit</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; slot, which seems fine on the EB164. I have tried both versions of MILO</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; mentioned above. I have tried slowing the PCI bus down as well as the CPU </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; with no change.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't understand the part about "wants to be IRQ16". As it's a PCI bus</i><br>
<i>&gt; card, it should be able to be any IRQ that the OS wants it to be. It's IRQ16</i><br>
<i>&gt; because you placed it in a specific slot, and the card is configured for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; particular INT[ABCD]. Since the PC164 uses IRQ16 for slot 0 INTA, I assume</i><br>
<i>&gt; that INTA is what the card asserts, and that it's in slot 0.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Have you tried moving the card to the other PCI slots, especially the 32-bit</i><br>
<i>&gt; ones? (From the above description of things you've tried, I expect so). Did</i><br>
<i>&gt; you notice any change in behaviour?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; --Jay++</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I have tried all slots and int lines A,B,C, and D. when MILO goes to<br>
look for devices I always see the following line rerardless of which<br>
slot/int lines:<br>
<p>
scsi-ncr53c7,8xx : at PCI bus 0, device 6, function 0<br>
scsi-ncr53c7,8xx : NCR53c810 at memory 0x1000000, io 0xb000, irq 16<br>
 <br>
if the card is NOT the last slot (64 bit) AND int line A then I get a scsi<br>
device time out message and the system hangs. Thats why Isay the card wants<br>
to be int 16 everywhere, though I admit I don't know what I mean by that.<br>
This happens with both the EB164 aand PC164 and this is not really a problem<br>
with MILO in that MILO, NT3.51, NT4.0, and DEC UNIX 3.2D all hang in some<br>
fashion if the card is not set that way. The interesting thing is that the<br>
the ARC console and SRM seem to work fine no matter where the card has been<br>
placed making me think they are no using interrups for the scsi card. I<br>
agree this seems strange but believe it has something to do with the card.<br>
Its a cheapy from Taiwan and perhaps should be tossed but I don't because<br>
none of my 9 spare scsi controllers in my drawer will support all 4 OSs.<br>
<p>
When I mentioned a problem with MILO with the PC164 its becasue the card<br>
sporatically casues a problem even when in the last slot of the PC164. I<br>
have discovered that it usually hangs after a power down cycle but after a<br>
soft boot seems to behave well.<br>
<p>
I doubt if this problem has anything to do with MILO so the header to my<br>
message was poorly chosen. I thought it might be of interest though as I too<br>
thought MILO and later the kernel would lay out the PCI bus to their liking.<br>
The only thing I can think of is that the designers have done something<br>
funny with the interrupt number register in the cards configuration space.<br>
