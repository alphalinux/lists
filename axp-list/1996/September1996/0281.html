Hi,<br>
Some months ago i reprogrammed the XF86_S3 X server. It was much too<br>
slow on Alpha and, more important, didn`t use the new mmio mode of the<br>
newer S3 chips. I want to use the Trio64V+ (and, later, ViRGE) for<br>
framegrabbing.<br>
There were still some errors which were mostly corrected by Harald<br>
Koenig whom you may know - many thanks.<br>
A second goal popped up some days ago. There might be a need to use more<br>
than one S3 card in a system.<br>
I have the RedHat 2.1 release right from the CD, fairly old stuff i<br>
know. That's kernel 1.3.57. The boot software is the ARC console.<br>
<p>
What happened:<br>
The new mmio mode requires a 64 MB window of aligned physical address<br>
space on the PCI. 0x1010000 bytes are 'mmap'ed. To my best knowledge the<br>
XF86_S3 makes only 32bit accesses to the S3 registers, at least in my<br>
original version. Because there were severe problems with the 968,<br>
Harald changed that to 16 bit accesses, so it works for the 968 on the<br>
xx86. My Trio64V+ never had that problem, neither on Alpha nor Intel.<br>
At the moment I don't know what 'gcc' makes with narrower accesses on<br>
Alpha, i suppose it`s a 32 bit read, modify with masking and write back.<br>
Because there is a wonderful mess with write only and read/write<br>
registers in the S3 chips i tried to stay with clean 32 bit write<br>
accesses - that has the nice side effect to be faster. Accesses to the<br>
S3 command register are serialized with an 'mb' of course.<br>
All this hopefully means that the direct register access happens in<br>
dense address space without using the HAE.<br>
<p>
1. I never was able to read a S3 register in the new mmio mode. The<br>
machine simply hangs. That doesn't hurt much for the graphics, the<br>
graphics processor status register can be read with the 'in()'<br>
emulation.<br>
But i can't program the registers for frame-grabbing, some of these MUST<br>
be read, which aren't accessible in I/O space. I don't have this problem<br>
on Intel.<br>
2. I want to get rid of the I/O accesses because i want to use more than<br>
one card at once. I put 2 S3 cards into the system. The ARC console<br>
prompted not even a single character. Then i removed the BIOS PROM from<br>
the second card. Now i got the message from the BIOS on the first S3<br>
card and the saw the line from the ARC console about 'emulation' ..<br>
Nothing more. In my Intel box i have no problems with booting the system<br>
with two cards. I can't do anything with the second one though.<br>
This is a problem of the boot firmware and may be solved in<br>
the meantime.<br>
3. After turning control to Milo and Linux often some or all characters<br>
displayed are garbage. It's random behaviour, about half of all cases<br>
it's all o.k. The system works fine, only the font loading produces<br>
garbage. Maybe that's fixed too.<br>
4. I connected a serial terminal to ttyS0 in the hope that i could get<br>
some message after a register read and before the crash. Wishful<br>
thinking. Instead the ARC console choose to turn off the graphics card<br>
and use the serial terminal exclusively. The S3 BIOS is not executed any<br>
more and the S3 card is therefore not usable in the system. After<br>
removing the serial line the card worked as before (fancy autodetect<br>
feature)<br>
7. If all wents well i have to program these damned I/O registers for<br>
the second S3 card. Apparently this can work only if it is up in the new<br>
mmio mode, else the first one gets disturbed. If i am very lucky there<br>
is no need to read them. The reads can happen only is sparse address<br>
space, because you first have to program the 8 bit wide index register,<br>
then read the nearby 8 bit wide data register. Is this supported in any<br>
way in the 'libc' or how could i do that?<br>
8. Understanding that i have an outdated system, how can i update it in<br>
the meanwhile? The best thing would be a CDROM from RedHat with ELF<br>
support, but when? Of course i can compile newer kernels, but do i have<br>
to patch them? What's with gcc changes and libc and and and ..<br>
 <br>
Hoping that somebody helps me out. In any case i was very pleased to<br>
hear that Digital Semi has a fulltime Linux group. Great!<br>
<p>
Greetings <br>
