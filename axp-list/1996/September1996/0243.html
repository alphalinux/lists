Some months ago, I encountered the same problems with "more"; I had used as <br>
source code for "more" the Slackware Linux/Intel 1.x source code distribution, <br>
and had built it on a DEC Alpha system running the "old" Linux/Alpha <br>
distribution termed "BLADE 0.3", including an "old" libc. Here are things <br>
discussed on these topics:<br>

* &gt; I first added lines like:<br>
* &gt; 	  otty.c_lflag &amp;= ~(ICANON|ECHO);<br>
* &gt;         + otty.c_cc[VMIN] = 1;   /* be sure it is 1 */<br>
* &gt;         + otty.c_cc[VTIME] = 0;  /* be sure it is 0 */<br>
* &gt; without success.<br>
<p>
* This one fixes more in util-linux-2.5 as well.  I suspect it shouldn't<br>
* be necessary.  It starts to look to me like TCGETA may not return the<br>
* correct values.  Looking at linux/include/asm-alpha/termios.h, we find<br>
* that trans_to_termio() sets the _VMIN and _VTIME entries *only* if the<br>
* ICANON flag is set in c_lflag whereas the x86 version always copies<br>
* everything unconditionally.<br>
<p>
* &gt; Then I noticed that ioctl() was called with (sometimes) a pointer to a<br>
* &gt; `struct termio' as 3rd argument, while (on Linux/Alpha/BLADE_0.3)<br>
* &gt; the Vxx array indexes differed beetween termio.c_cc[] and termios.c_cc[]<br>
* &gt; ... and in system headers VMIN * &amp; co are overriden to suit the<br>
* &gt; `struct termio' variants only when &lt;termio.h&gt; is included  ... and it's<br>
* &gt; not the case in more.c.<br>
<p>
* termio and termios are not compatible on Linux/Alpha (in fact, you get<br>
* an error message when trying to include both header files).  As long<br>
* as one sticks with one or the other, everything will (should) work<br>
* fine though.  So the real bug may have been that the old more.c<br>
* included termios.h when it should have included termio.h (this is<br>
* correct in the version distributed by Red Hat).<br>

* The more in Red Hat does not include sys/ioctl.h.  But it's a mess<br>
* anyways.  I'm not going to be able to look into this soon (I'm having<br>
* plenty fun with glibc already), but if somebody could track this down<br>
* (e.g., *why* are termio and termios incompatible?  what does OSF/1<br>
* do?  etc) it surely looks like something that should go into 2.0.<br>
* The reason I'm pushing glibc (besides being good in itself) is that<br>
* it will require a few kernel changes as well---needless to say, 2.0<br>
* sounds like a target for these...<br>

* OK, here is the scoop:<br>
*<br>
* The OSF/1 (and System V?) version of termio interprets termio.c_cc[4]<br>
* and termio.c_cc[5] as VEOF and VEOL if ICANON is set in<br>
* termio.c_lflag.  If ICANON is not set, those fields are interpreted as<br>
* VMIN and VTIME, respectively.  What more does is get the current<br>
* termio structure, turn off ICANON (as well as making some other<br>
* changes), and then it sets the new termio structure.  Since the old<br>
* structure was gotten with ICANON set, the values in termio.c_cc[4]/[5]<br>
* are the VEOF and VEOL values but when they are set, they are<br>
* interpreted as VMIN and VTIME...  So it really is necessary to set<br>
* VMIN and VTIME in more---it's not a kernel problem (but it sure is<br>
* ugly...).<br>
*<br>
* I guess the solution is to encourage everyone to use termios (that's<br>
* why less is more... :-)<br>
<p>
Summary: when using early (1995) versions of Linux/Alpha system headers and <br>
libc, there were terminal I/O buffering problems in the AXP executable <br>
obtained for classic Linux commands relying on the old-styled "termio" API, <br>
such as the "more" command.<br>
I made changes both in system headers and the source code for "more" <br>
--"ispell" is perhaps another example-- to fix such problems.<br>
<p>
I can't say if the problem you recently encountered with "elm" is the same or <br>
not: while I built a working "elm" on Linux/Alpha, I have no longer my source <br>
code on-line. As far as I remember, for commands relying on the "curses" API, <br>
I used the "ncurses" Linux/Alpha library variant instead of the "curses" <br>
variant. However, I don't know if these two variants are supported in today <br>
RedHat distributions for Linux/Alpha.<br>
<p>
Note: the Elvis "vi" clone uses a custom version of "curses" that is embedded <br>
within the source code for this command. This could explain why "vi" works <br>
while "elm" does not.<br>
