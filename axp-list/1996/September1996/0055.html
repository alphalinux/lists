<i>&gt; &gt; It was sort of odd... first sign of trouble was init dying.  (Yikes!)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, I think I've seen this before - init dies, and then it's all down-hill</i><br>
<i>&gt; from there.</i><br>
....<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do you have an oops from init? That's the interesting one.. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Alternatively, the reason for the problems might be just a bug in the shared</i><br>
<i>&gt; libs causing init to die, not a kernel problem at all.</i><br>
<p>
I have seen yesterday something suspiciously like this, but this was<br>
2.0.14 on a Cabriolet board and otherwise Red Hat 3.0.3, i.e. no shared<br>
libraries at all.<br>
<p>
I was able to watch how things evolved in a span of many hours, as I<br>
happened to be logged on remotely but was unable to do anything.<br>
<p>
No violent happenings, no oopses or other visible traces (syslogd<br>
possibly went away early).  Just various daemons quietly going away.<br>
Initially I was able to stop and restart inetd services, and this gave<br>
me a short window in which it was possible to get another login, but<br>
soon telnetd went away once again and could not be revived.  ftp worked<br>
**from** an affected machine for many hours yet, but no way to ftp to<br>
it.<br>
<p>
When I noticed that something weird is starting I tried 'shutdown -r'.<br>
It was going through initial messages but that was it.  Repeated<br>
attempts did not have any real effect.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (The system usually continues to limp along, but you get panic messages for</i><br>
<i>&gt; anything that causes a child to be inherited by the non-existent init. At</i><br>
<i>&gt; least that's how I seem to remember it). </i><br>
<p>
There was no panic messages.  Everything was quiet but with time more<br>
and more daemons were turning into zombies, at least according to ps.<br>
Eventually, after some six hours or so, most likely init itself died<br>
and the whole machine wedged solid to be revived only with a power<br>
switch and a prolonged fsck (some incoming mail ended in /lost+found).<br>
<p>
I am not 100% sure that this is exactly the same, but if it is it is<br>
not limited to 2.0.17 and shared libraries.<br>
<p>
   Keep on hackin'<br>
