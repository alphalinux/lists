<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You mention that the UDB was never intended for performance work.  That's</i><br>
<i>&gt;ok, cause I just want a web server to act as a virtual web host.  I see the</i><br>
<i>&gt;system demands being mostly TCP/IP and disk access.  There may be databases</i><br>

<i>&gt;server software is multi-threaded not fork().  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Do you feel that this would be an acceptable use of a UDB 266?</i><br>
<i>&gt;        If I compiled the server deamon with the digital compiler, should I</i><br>
<i>&gt;            get a boost in performance (vs. gcc)?</i><br>
If you are thinking of buying a UDB 233 then you would probably be better<br>
off with a system based on the "noname" or AXPpci33 board. This is the 21066<br>
chip on a AT factor PCI/ISA motherboard which many DEC TOEMs, (including<br>
ourselves) integrate into an enclosure as a more similar system to a normal p.c.<br>
This way you can have your choice of components, and no upgrade, hardweare<br>
choice issues. Finally, DEC UNIX is not available on the UDB, so this would<br>
be your least expensive route to DEC UNIX on Alpha.<br>
Bear in mind in either case that the "older" 21064 and 21066 chips are not<br>
very fast, and from a performance point of view a Pentium may be a better<br>
choice in the lower end.<br>
If all you are doing is a small server then the 166MHz UDB is not a bad<br>
machine. I have one site where we are handling 54 Samba users, Smail, Simeon<br>
mail IMAP server, and NIS to the head office on a DEC 3000-300 which is an<br>
older 21064 100MHz machine with 96 MB RAM, and it keeps up just fine.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Would you compare Linux and Digital Unix?  I'm looking for things like</i><br>
<i>&gt;performance, ease of administration, etc.  </i><br>
Linux is experimental, so what I say today is probably obsolete next week.<br>
Still it is a good platform in general, albeit new. Performance of compilers<br>
and some libraries ( esp. floating point and math in general) is much better<br>
on DEC UNIX, although Digital has promised us a compile of their advanced<br>
math libs soon for Linux users. Admin? Depends on what you are used to.<br>
Digital does not make a simple UNIX, but if it is what you are accustomed to<br>
it works just fine.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If I have the GCC libs, can I use the Digital compiler "out of the box"?  </i><br>
Ummm, not exactly<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How is the alignment requirement handle?  </i><br>
Depends on what you are doing and how current your patchlevels on software are.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Does the Digital compiler correct alignment errors or at least notify me</i><br>
<i>&gt;during compile?  </i><br>
Usually.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Are there any hardware compatibility issues that I should be aware of?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Which TGA model does the QS1 motherboard have?</i><br>
DEC 21030 chip usually bundled with 2MB DRAM and Brooktree RAMDAC. Bear in<br>
mind this is _not_ a video card, the chips are part of the UDB motherboard<br>
package. It is _similar_ to a TGA in that chips are the same. This is an<br>
8bit color video setup.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Does v3.2 come with an X server that supports the TGA ZLXp-E2 or E3?</i><br>
<i>&gt;And lastly, what is list price for v3.2c?</i><br>
DEC UNIX does support these, please note that current rev. is 4.0.<br>
<p>
UNIX license cost varies with CPU.<br>
 2 user DEC UNIX license pack and SRM  for a AXPpci233 board is about $800 <br>
        ( U.S.dollars).<br>
The package with CDs and DOCS costs about $275, and does not vary with CPU.<br>
<p>
3 Year upgrade and docs subscription costs additional.<br>
<p>
Support agreements, ditto...<br>
<p>
Conclusions:<br>
Cheapest Linux platform at Pentium level or better: UDB 166<br>
If you are thinking of a 233UDB buy a Pentium or Cyrix 6x86. More bang for $.<br>
If you want faster yet buy a 20164A or 21164. Not very cheap, but beats<br>
Pentium Pro by amount varying with $ spent. <br>
A UDB 166 ( VX40B-F2) cost under $800 U.S.<br>
<p>
A good Pentium 166 system costs about $2000 or less.<br>
<p>
A decent 21066 - 233 axpPCI (noname) system costs about $ 4000 with Linux,<br>
and about $ 5000 with DEC UNIX ( 64MB, 1GB SCSI, better video, ether,<br>
CDROM,etc..)<br>
<p>
A 21064A-275MHz in an equivalent system costs about $6000 to $8000.<br>
<p>
This is sort of a quick price/performance scale.<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
Cheers,<br>
        Maurice<br>
