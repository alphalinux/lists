<i> &gt; Now that I'm looking over this more carefully, it looks like the</i><br>
<i> &gt; problem might be that the de4x5 driver is picking up the ethernet</i><br>
<i> &gt; interface when in fact (since it's a dc21040), we should be using the</i><br>
<i> &gt; tulip driver...  I'll look into this some more...  I think I'll also</i><br>
<i> &gt; try tossing in a different ethernet card (a de4x5, since the faq</i><br>
<i> &gt; doesn't say that the dc21040 is supported).</i><br>
<p>
No, that would be a waste of time.  The de4x5 is the right driver for<br>
the 21040.  The tulip driver is an alternate driver which is not known<br>
to work on the Alpha (and I don't think there is much reason to port<br>
it either---the de4x5 driver works very well).<br>
<p>
Not sure why you're having problems with the driver.  It may be there<br>
is something funky about the interrupt handling in the AS255.  Without<br>
access to an AS255, it's kind of difficult to find out what's going<br>
on.  Maybe somebody else can help?<br>
<p>
The one thing you could try is compile a later version of the kernel.<br>
There have been some bug fixes in the PCI code w.r.t. bridge support.<br>
But given that the 255 is touted as an entry-level machine, I doubt<br>
that it contains a PCI bridge.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; The problem is that X sort of comes up, but the image is completely a</i><br>
<i> &gt; mess.  It looks like it's not writing properly to video memory.  The</i><br>
<i> &gt; xtga beta v0.0 readme says that only 8 bit X is currently supported,</i><br>
<i> &gt; but the X server only comes up when we configure for 24 bits</i><br>
<i> &gt; (presumably because the card has 24 bitplanes).  Is this still the</i><br>
<i> &gt; case for the beta 0.2 server (which I just downloaded from</i><br>
<i> &gt; ftp.digital.com)?  I'm not using the EV5 server.  Should I?  It didn't</i><br>
<i> &gt; seem to work at all.  Or do I need to swap video cards?</i><br>
<p>
I think you're out of luck.  Either get an 8 bit TGA, or get some<br>
other PC card (#9 GXE 64 works quite well, for example).  The TGA X<br>
server is much faster, so if you want to impress people, stick with an<br>
8 bit TGA.<br>
