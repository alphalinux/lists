Stephen Gaudet of DCG Computers Inc. &lt;<a href="mailto:sjg@dcginc.com">sjg@dcginc.com</a>&gt; writes:<br>
<i>&gt; So, bottom line it has a two year warranty on all parts and labor.  And as</i><br>
<i>&gt; you well know we've been clocking chips up since the first Jensen rolled off</i><br>
<i>&gt; the line and NEVER replaced a burnt out processor yet!</i><br>
<p>
In my opinion, if the only ill effect of exceeding the rated speed on a<br>
processor was burning them out from time to time, that would be entirely<br>
trivial.  If I could had an application where I actually *needed* a<br>
10-15% performance increase, and only had to replace burned out processors<br>
once in a while, I would seriously consider it.<br>
<p>
But the reality is that the integrity of my data is of far greater<br>
importance to me.<br>
<p>
The Alpha's built in ECC does a great job of detecting errors in the<br>
rest of the computer.  But what will detect errors in the Alpha?<br>
<p>
Semiconductor manufacturers invest a great deal of effort in characterizing<br>
the performance of each new chip they design, and each change to the<br>
fabrication process.  They also tests on each part they ship in order to<br>
guarantee that it meets the rated specfications over the entire operating<br>
voltage and temperature ranges.<br>
<p>
The designers know exactly where the critical paths in the chip are, so they<br>
know how to test for worst case conditions.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, most third party vendors just pop the chip into a<br>
board, crank the clock speed up, and verify that it seems to run Doom<br>
or Minesweeper properly.  Of course, this doesn't give any indication as<br>
to whether some critical path in the chip is close to the limit and likely<br>
to cause occasional errors.  After all, once the third party vendor sells<br>
the box, what does he care if one in ten billion add instructions gives<br>
the wrong answer (for example).  After all, if the customer notices the<br>
failure at all, he'll have a hard time proving it and demanding a refund.<br>
<p>
In my experience, all semiconductor vendors are willing to evaluate OEM<br>
customer requests for deviations from specifications.  In some cases,<br>
they are willing (for a price, or a guaranteed sale) to expend the<br>
engineering effort needed to determine that a particular specification of<br>
a part can be safely exceeded under controlled conditions.  For instance,<br>
it is not uncommon to get a specification waiver stating that a part can<br>
be operated at some particular higher clock frequency provided that another<br>
specification such as voltage or temperature is restricted to a narrower<br>
range.  Perhaps DCG has such an arrangement with DEC?  Of course, if they<br>
did then what they are doing isn't really overclocking at all.<br>
<p>
Perhaps I am being overly harsh.  Perhaps DCG Computers Inc.  does in fact<br>
have some state-of-the-art semiconductor test equipment, and perhaps they<br>
actually have licensed a good set of test vectors from Digital Semiconductor.<br>
I'm sure Mr. Gaudet will be happy to explain to us what steps DCG takes to<br>
insure the integrity of their overclocked systems.<br>
<p>
Until then, I am going to have to content myself with Alphas that merely<br>
run at their rated clock speed.<br>
<p>
IMNSHO, any reseller selling overclocked systems *without* some sort of<br>
comprehensive testing approved by the semiconductor manufacturer should<br>
be stripped of their "authorized" status.<br>
<p>
I would by lying if I claimed never to have overclocked any systems or<br>
chips myself.  But I do it out of curiousity, in an attempt to guage (in<br>
an extremely rough sense) the amount of margin in the specifications.<br>
And I only do it for long enough to satisfy that curiousity.  I certainly<br>
don't sell overclocked products; it is bad engineering practice and a<br>
possible source of liability, not just for my company, but for me<br>
personally.<br>
