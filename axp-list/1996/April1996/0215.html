Eric,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The problem is that the extra terminator that shouldn't be present is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;one built into the PCI riser card, and there is no obvious way to disable</i><br>
<i>&gt;it, short of desoldering the resistor pack.  I've heard numerous claims</i><br>
<i>&gt;(but not from Digital) that it is automatic.  If someone would care to</i><br>
<i>&gt;explain how a resistor pack can be automatic, maybe I'd be more inclined</i><br>
<i>&gt;to believe it.</i><br>
<p>
OK, I got curious about this, having been inside a UDB a number of times,<br>
I've even got a few extra risers with various configurations (more later).<br>
I've *many* times used external CDROM and disk off the external SCSI port,<br>
and *never* experienced a problem. Can't tell you how many test RH installs<br>
I've done on UDB's with external CDROM... :-)<br>
<p>
Anyway, I popped open one box: no terminators on the riser. I looked at a few<br>
extra risers: no termination. My belief is that termination is normally done<br>
*not* with resistors on the riser, but with the external SCSI connector itself;<br>
ie it terminates if nothing is plugged into it, and doesn't if something *is*.<br>
Isn't this typical of this type of setup nowadays?<br>
<p>
Now, Eric, I believe you must have some strange variation of riser card; I've<br>
seen a number of different ones, and none have had termination like you<br>
describe. I think you/we ought to see about getting a replacement for it.<br>
It almost sounds like a proto, as I'm sure that production models wouldn't<br>
be set up this way.<br>
<p>
I've seen a number of these risers, some without the PCI bus slot on them, so<br>
that a 3.5 inch disk would fit inside (I've got a 233MHz model, 1MB cache,<br>
with a SCSI Fireball inside); that one goes along with a small plate that<br>
gets suspended inside and holds the drive. There are lots of little widgets,<br>
ie risers with variations, like one with no PCI slot, only external SCSI and<br>
internal power feed, so that one could hook up an internal IDE disk. I don't<br>
even know if all these widgets even have separate part numbers, maybe someone<br>
else knows.<br>
<p>
Anyway, Eric, I think you've got a dud riser; lets see what we can do about it.<br>
