<i> &gt;         Can someone tell me what the status of glib.c for linux-alpha is?</i><br>
<i> &gt; I have some C++ codes that need work.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I can.  The latest glibc snapshot plus some additional patches by<br>
me allow glibc to compile and work.  There are still quite a few<br>
header files that are either wrong (they should be based on the Linux<br>
kernel headers, but instead define their own, sometimes incompatible<br>
constants etc.) or simply missing.<br>
<p>
The FSF maintainer of glibc should be back from vacation shortly and I<br>
hope we'll be able to resolve the remaining header file issues soon.<br>
(Note: as mentioned earlier, I'm buried with work until after first or<br>
second week of May. Till then, I have practically no time for Linux<br>
work.)<br>
<p>
Emacs used to work under glibc but the newest pretest doesn't.<br>
Similarly, ghostscript works worse when using glibc compared to the<br>
old libc.  I suspect memory manager problems, so that needs to be<br>
debugged.<br>
<p>
strptime() is missing; if somebody knows of a version that is *really*<br>
in the public domain, let me know.  Don't bother if it's not public<br>
domain since FSF is rather picky about copyright issues.  Even better<br>
would be if it had been written by sometbody who has signed a<br>
copyright assignment with FSF already.<br>
<p>
Timezone support doesn't seem to work quite yet either.  Even after<br>
setting TZ and/or /etc/localtime to "US/Arizona", I either get GMT or<br>
EST.<br>
<p>
/etc/host.conf support is missing.  I started implementing this and<br>
made good progress, but see above comment regarding time...  If<br>
somebody has good documentation on what some of the options in there<br>
really are supposed to do, I'd love to hear about it (the existing<br>
code in HJ's libc is, shall I say, "suboptimal").  E.g., what are<br>
"trimdomains" *really* used for?<br>
<p>
Despite all these missing things, it is possible to compile<br>
non-trivial C++ programs with glibc+libg++.  The problem is that glibc<br>
and the old libc are not binary compatible and the header files are<br>
wildely different.  Thus, putting together an environment that would<br>
allow coexistence of the old libc and glibc would be quite<br>
timeconsuming (e.g., consider /etc/localtime).  glibc definitively<br>
isn't ready to substitute libc.<br>
<p>
Sorry for not having better news, but let's not forget that for a fair<br>
number of developers Linux is still basically a hobby.<br>
<p>

<p>
PS: I don't want to sit on the patches I have.  If somebody else wants<br>
to take over, just give a holler.  I have a long list of other things<br>
that I'd love to hack on.<br>
