#&gt; Hello Mihaly<br>
#&gt; <br>
#&gt; &gt;I've an ALPHA based MULTIA with 32MB of RAM.<br>
#&gt; &gt;There are 4 8MB 72 pin modules. There are 20 NHY514400, and 4  511000<br>
#&gt; &gt;chips on a single module. What kind of  module is this? Maybe this is a<br>
#&gt; &gt;2x42bit organisation? Or it is a simple 36bit module?<br>
#&gt; &gt;Any hints? What does it means ECC? Is there any error<br>
#&gt; &gt;correction/detection, or there is a simple parity check only?<br>
#&gt; <br>
#&gt; What you have is x36 memory with true parity, not ECC.  You need x36 ram,<br>
#&gt; 70ns or faster with TRUE parity to run on an Alpha system.<br>
#&gt; <br>
#&gt; Cheers,<br>

The Multia (aka UDB) uses the 21066 Alpha processor, which has a built-in<br>
memory controller. The memory controller supports an external memory bus<br>
that is 64 bits wide.<br>
<p>
Normally, a 36-bit SIMM is used to provide 4 bytes of data with one parity bit<br>
for each byte. Each 'byte' lane has a separate CAS control signal allowing bytes<br>
(with their associated parity bit) to be written independently.<br>
<p>
The 21066 memory controller can *only* do 64-bit accesses to memory. If your<br>
code does a 32-bit write that is handled by the memory controller as a<br>
read-modify-write cycle. Therefore, all of the SIMM's CAS signals are wired<br>
together.<br>
<p>
Since the memory is 64-bits wide and the SIM provides 32 bits (plus 4 parity),<br>
SIMMs must be fitted in pairs (2-at-a-time). The 8 'parity' bits on the SIMM<br>
are used to provide ECC (error correcting code) detection and correction. It<br>
can correct 1-bit errors, detect 2-bit errors and detect 4-bit nibble errors.<br>
<p>
So, because it only does 64-bit memory accesses, the 21066 is able to provide<br>
ECC, whilst using Parity DRAM SIMMs.<br>
<p>
Now, for completeness it is worth explaining what is meant by "true" parity<br>
SIMMs. Parity SIMMs have a memory chip holds bit 9 for each of the 4 bytes. Some<br>
SIMMs (not-true-parity SIMMs?) have been designed to be cheaper by adding a<br>
parity generator *instead* of the memory chip that holds bit 9 for each of the 4<br>
bytes. When you write to such a device, parity is ignored. When you read from<br>
such a device, parity is calculated from the 8-bit data and driven out (with<br>
slightly worse timing). These SIMMs will not work in all systems because they<br>
make an assumption about what data is stored in the specific bit.<br>
<p>
<p>
Mihaly, in response to your specific question, I cannot figure out what<br>
those SIMMs you have could be. The NHY514400 parts are probably 4-bit wide<br>
and the 511000 are probably 1-bit wide. If your multia is working then I'd<br>
guess that they must be 36-bit SIMMs. Note that it is possible to turn off<br>
ECC checking, which would allow you to use 32-bit SIMMs (but at your<br>
own risk...). <br>
