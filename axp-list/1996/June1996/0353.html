...this is just a follow-up to Harald's report of a problem<br>
he was having with g77-0.5.17 (Craftworks' version, I believe).<br>
<p>
At first I thought the only "problem" was that he hadn't<br>
specified -finit-local-zero, as the crash was due to trying<br>
to print an uninitialized floating-point value, that happened<br>
to be a denormal.<br>
<p>
Then I noticed he mentioned this in the header, and also pointed<br>
out a problem in earlier printouts, in that the value printed<br>
for a SQRT(AMAX1(...)) result could be right or wrong, depending<br>
on what -O level was used.<br>
<p>
I've investigated that problem, using the g77/Alpha development<br>
version I've been working on, and it appears to be a gcc back<br>
end bug.  The cmpt*/fcmov* pairs just prior to calling sqrt<br>
are incorrectly coded, causing incorrect results from the<br>
AMAX1 intrinsic.  (Fixing these pairs in the generated .s<br>
file and assembling that file produces a program that works<br>
properly.)<br>
<p>
I've reported this problem to two of the gcc maintainers, and it<br>
turns out they might already have a fix, if not, it seems likely<br>
to be easy to fix.<br>
<p>
In any case, I just wanted people to know that g77/Alpha work is<br>
indeed proceeding.  Aside from this outstanding problem, which I<br>
expect will be resolved shortly, I have no known outstanding bugs<br>
in the development version of g77/Alpha that I can reproduce.<br>
(There are two bug cases reported on g77/Alpha using an OS other<br>
than Linux, but I cannot reproduce them -- I might look into these<br>
further.)<br>
<p>
Of course, testing is being done by a very small number of people,<br>
and it's as yet unclear how or when the development version will<br>
be made available for public use.  Further, I haven't investigated<br>
any of the performance issues yet.  (I did notice that the buggy<br>
cmpt*/fcmov* pairs could each be reduced to one instruction; maybe<br>
I'll get into writing peephole or other optimizations for gcc's<br>
Alpha support down the road.)<br>
<p>
At least, thanks to Craftworks, Carrera, and DCG, for lending me<br>
this Linux/Alpha workstation, there has finally been real progress<br>
getting g77 to work on this machine (and, perhaps, resulting in a<br>
fix to gcc that could make C code using floating-point work as well).<br>
