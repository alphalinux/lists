Hello udb owners<br>
<p>
Enclosed is the directions to load a udb on Red Hat.  No guaratees!<br>
<p>
Directions to install RedHat 3.0.3 Linux Alpha on UDB <br>
<p>
(The same should apply for the PC64 and EB164 motherboard, just the milo)<br>
(&amp;.img files are different)<br>
<p>
Instructions on how to a system from scratch, starting with <br>
<p>
	o Red Hat 3.0.3 Linux Alpha CD-ROM <br>
	o 3 blank floppies<br>
		linload.exe &amp; "milo"&lt;dos format&gt;<br>
		udb.img  &lt;BOOT&gt; &lt;use noname.img&gt;<br>
		ramdisk.img &lt;ROOT&gt;<br>
	o PC running dos (or something that will allow you to make these diskettes)<br>
<p>
* Create linload.exe &amp; milo DOS floppy:<br>
<p>
	Insert the Red Hat CD into a DOS based PC system and access the CD.  <br>
You will find linload.exe in under milo\arc\, find linload.exe, copy it onto <br>
your DOS floppy.<br>
	<br>
	On same floppy as linload.exe, install milo, here's how:<br>
	For the UDB go to milo\images\udb\, copy milo onto your <br>
floppy.<br>
	<br>
* Create the boot floppy by installing a write-enabled blank floppy in your PC<br>
floppy drive follow the following instructions:<br>
<p>
	First, because MILO can't read a DOS floppy you will have to copy <br>
"rawrite" into your DOS directory as follows"<br>
<p>
	In \dosutils on your Red Hat CD you'll see rawrite.exe copy it into your <br>
directory on your PC where DOS resides, ie:\dos.  Once rawrite is there than<br>
you <br>
can do a rawrite from your Red Hat CD onto your installed floppy.<br>
<p>
	On the Red Hat CD find \images\1390\noname.img, type in the following:<br>
	rawrite -f noname.img -d a: -n, should be no response errors.<br>
	FYI; a PC will be unable to read this floppy image now.<br>
<p>
	Pull out the floppy, mark it "UDB.IMG", this is now your BOOT floppy,<br>
	install a new floppy into your drive.<br>
	<br>
	Same applies for the PC64 &amp; EB164, \images\1390\cabrio.img type in the<br>
following:<br>
	rawrite -f cabrio.img -d a: -n, should be no response errors.<br>
	FYI; a PC will be unable to read this floppy image now.<br>
<p>
* Create the ramdisk image floppy as follows:<br>
<p>
  	Again on the Red Hat CD find \images\ramdisk.img, then <br>
	rawrite -f ramdisk.img -d a: -n, should be no response errors.<br>
<p>
	Pull out the floppy, mark it RAMDISK.IMG, this is now your ROOT floppy.<br>
<p>
We are now ready to load Red Hat Linux onto your Multia system.<br>
 <br>
* Turn on the power to the system. It will think for a while (perhaps 30<br>
  seconds) before displaying anything on the screen -- don't let that<br>
  throw you.<br>
<p>
  Ultimately you'll see a blue screen, a couple of "Initializing"<br>
  messages, and probably an odd-colored screen that says "Warning: the<br>
  firmware has found a problem". You can ignore these.<br>
<p>
  When you see the boot menu, and the countdown timer, press down arrow<br>
  to stop it from remote booting.<br>
<p>
  It's also possible that you'll see "Error: Device error, press any<br>
  key to continue" -- especially if you have a factory-fresh UDB.<br>
  Press some key, then press the "down arrow" key immediately, as<br>
  you'll probably be at the boot menu.<br>
<p>
* You're now at the Boot menu. Select "Supplementary menu", then<br>
  "Display hardware configuration." Note the amount of physical<br>
  memory, *as* *displayed*! The SIMMs in the UDB have lots and lots of<br>
  chips, and might fool you into believing you have more memory than<br>
  you really do.<br>
<p>
* Now zip through the "Press any key to continue" displays, and note<br>
  the many interesting things that the ARC console can tell you about<br>
  your system :-)<br>
<p>
* Back at the "Supplementary menu," select "Set up the system...",<br>
  then "Manage boot selection menu...", then "Delete a boot<br>
  selection...". Delete any and all existing boot selections!<br>
<p>
* Now, from the "Boot selections menu," select "Add a boot<br>
  selection..."<br>
<p>
* At "Select a system partition for this boot selection," select<br>
  "Floppy disk 0". <br>
<p>
* At "Enter the osloader directory and name:...", delete the existing<br>
  text and enter "linload.exe"<br>
<p>
* To "Is the operating system in the same partition as the osloader,"<br>
  select "Yes"<br>
<p>
* At "Enter the operating system root directory," delete all characters <br>
  from the default response, and enter "milo".<br>
<p>
* At "Enter a name for this boot selection," delete the existing<br>
  answer and type "floppy milo"<br>
<p>
* To "Do you want to initialize the debugger at boot time," select<br>
  "no"<br>
<p>
* Back at the boot selection menu, select "Change a boot selection",<br>
  and then select "floppy milo" (which should be the only selection at<br>
  this point), and press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* Press ESCape to exit from this menu.<br>
<p>
* DownArrow to  "Supplementary menu, and save changes...", then press<br>
  ENTER.<br>
<p>
* Now it gets exciting! Put the milo floppy in the floppy drive,<br>
  and select "Boot menu", then "Boot floppy milo".  If all goes well,<br>
  you'll see some load messages, and the floppy will chug for a while,<br>
  then you'll see the "MILO&gt;" prompt.<br>
<p>
* Insert the BOOT floppy, and type<br>
<p>
	boot fd0:vmlinux.gz root=/dev/fd0 load_ramdisk=1<br>
<p>
* You'll see some "scsi:" messages go by, and quite possibly a<br>
  "machine check" message or two -- you can ignore all of those. Then<br>
  you should see a series of hash marks ("###"), and a bunch more<br>
  messages, until you see<br>
<p>
	"VFS: Insert ROOT floppy to be loaded into ramdisk and press ENTER"<br>
<p>
  At this time, remove the boot floppy and insert the ramdisk floppy,<br>
  and press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* Linux will print a series of &lt;5&gt;/ across the screen as it loads the<br>
  ram disk; it will then start the Red Hat installation.<br>
<p>
* To "What type of source installation media do you want to use,"<br>
  type "1" (for CD-Rom installation), then press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* A few more messages will appear, including one that says something<br>
  about "invalid arguments," that you can ignore.<br>
<p>
    When it asks you to insert your boot floppy, remove the ramdisk<br>
  floppy, insert the boot floppy, and press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* When it asks "Do you need to partition your disks," select "yes" by<br>
  pressing ENTER.<br>
<p>
* A screen titled "Disk Partitions" is displayed. Press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* Some error messages will appear. Ignore them.<br>
<p>
  A screen titled "Disk Partitioning" is displayed. Ensure that the<br>
  "fdisk" entry is highlighted, and press ENTER.<br>
<p>
*****************************************************************************<br>
   If you can't get into fdisk as described above do the following:<br>
<p>
At this point the system get a mini load installed and next step is to <br>
prepare the hard disk.  Your going to need to partition the hard drive.  <br>
The screen will come up to ask you if you want to do it but, will not respond.  <br>
Therefore, highlight "done" and move to installation screen.  At installation <br>
screen highlight "shell", Alt F2, this will take you to a #.  From here you <br>
want to type in "cd /usr/bin ".<br>
<p>
Type "mke2fs /dev/sda"<br>
type "fdisk"<br>
type "x" takes you to an expert screen<br>
<p>
enter in the cylinders, sectors and heads of your hard disk, i.e.:<br>
	c=cylinders	2112<br>
	h=heads		16<br>
	s=sectors	63<br>
should show 2128896 blocks, done by 2112x16x63=<br>
<p>
type "r" to return to menu, also saves parameters<br>
<p>
Partition disk as follows:<br>
A = "/" 	for root<br>
B= "/usr" 	for user<br>
C= "swap"	needed for swap space, usual rule is 2x memory size, <br>
ie: 32mb x 2 = 64mb swap.<br>
<p>
Type "t" to change partition "A" to 4<br>
	Changed system type of partition 1 to 4 (DOS 16-bit &lt;32M)<br>
<p>
Type "t" to change partition "C" to swap, enter "82 " for Linux swap code.<br>
<p>
Type "p" to verify that the partitions have been entered properly.<br>
<p>
Type "w" to write table to disk.<br>
<p>
At # hit Alt F1 to get back to Linux install program<br>
<p>
Choose "Express"<br>
<p>
Express will walk you through setup and format the partitions as follows:<br>
/dev/sda3 = swap<br>
/dev/sda1 = /<br>
/dev/sda2= /usr<br>
<p>
***************************************************************************<br>
<p>
	IF FDISK works from Red Hat installation then:<br>
<p>
* When it asks "Which disk do you want to partition," and highlights<br>
  "/dev/sda", press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* (You'll see a couple of "kernel: unaligned trap" messages now, and<br>
  through the next couple of steps. you can ignore them.)<br>
<p>
Delete any existing disk partitions, as follows (ignore warnings<br>
  and error messages in this step):<br>
<p>
	Command (m for help): d<br>
	Partition number (1-4): 4<br>
	Command (m for help): d<br>
	Partition number (1-4): 3<br>
	Command (m for help): d<br>
	Partition number (1-4): 2<br>
	Command (m for help): d<br>
	Partition number (1-4): 1<br>
<p>
  Now create the desired partitions, please note every drive is different.  THIS<br>
IS ONLY AN EXAMPLE:<br>
<p>
	Command (m for help): n<br>
	Command action /e extended /p primary partition: p &lt; / root&gt;<br>
	Partition number (1-4): 1<br>
	First cylinder (1-324): 1<br>
	Last cylinder or +size ...: +1440K   (***** This must be followed*****)<br>
<p>
	Command (m for help): t<br>
	Partition number (1-4): 1<br>
	Hex code (type L to list codes): 4<br>
	Changed system type of partition 1 to 4 (DOS 16-bit &lt;32M)<br>
<p>
	Command (m for help): n<br>
	Command action /e extended /p primary partition: p &lt;/usr&gt;<br>
	Partition number (1-4): 2<br>
	First cylinder (3-324): 3<br>
	Last cylinder or +size ...: 291    (** make this a big as possible **)<br>
					   (** remember about swap, though **)<br>
	Command (m for help): n<br>
	Command action /e extended /p primary partition: p &lt;/swap&gt;<br>
	Partition number (1-4): 3<br>
	First cylinder (292-324): 292<br>
	Last cylinder or +size ...: 324	 (** I try to make it twice memory size **)<br>
					 (** however, some make it same as mem size**)<br>
	Command (m for help): t<br>
	Partition number (1-4): 3<br>
	Hex code (type L to list codes): 82<br>
	Changed system type of partition 2 to 82 (Linux swap)<br>
<p>
	Command (m for help): w<br>
<p>
* After a few initimidating messages which you can ignore, you'll see<br>
  "Hit enter to continue" -- press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* Back at the "Disk partitioning" screen, downArrow to "done", then press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* At the next screen, downArrow to "Continue", then press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* At the "Add swap" screen, press ENTER to select "Yes".<br>
<p>
* After a brief pause, you'll see the "Format Swap" screen, which will<br>
  say "This may take a minute" -- wait patiently.<br>
<p>
* At the "Net Config" screen, press ENTER to select "Yes".<br>
<p>
* At the "Filesystems" screen, press spaceBar to select /dev/sda2, and<br>
  press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* At the next screen, asking "Are you absolutely certain...", press<br>
  ENTER.<br>
<p>
* Now comes the package selection. Press upArrow or downArrow to get<br>
  to a package name, and then press spaceBar to select the package.<br>
  (If you accidentally select the wrong package, press spaceBar again<br>
  to de-select it.)<br>
<p>
  Select the following packages: (** for 300mb disks your limited to this **)<br>
<p>
	Shells<br>
	Communications<br>
	Printing<br>
	Networking<br>
	Network Admin<br>
	Networking Servers<br>
	Development Libraries<br>
	Games<br>
	Development<br>
	Mail<br>
	Sound<br>
<p>
  When everything has been selected, press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* The installation procedure will now format the SCSI disk and install<br>
  the packages that you've selected. This will take about an hour,<br>
  so go do something else while it finishes.  Also if the screen goes black<br>
  which it will, hit space bar to bring it back.<br>
<p>
* Ultimately, you'll get to a screeen that says "Package Installation<br>
  is complete." Press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* At some point you'll be asked about graphics adapter.  If your using TGA<br>
  than select the ATI Mach card it will ask you less questions.  Don't probe<br>
  for clocks and such, just get through the install. <br>
<p>
* The kernel image from the boot floppy will now be copied to your<br>
  system, and then a screen asking "Which type of mouse do you have?"<br>
  DownArrow to the option "ps2-bus : C&amp;T 82C710 or PS/2 sytle (aux port)"<br>
  and press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* Now comes "Networking has already been configured (probably for an<br>
  NFS install). Do you wish to use this configuration..." Unless you<br>
  have some good reason not to, press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* Now comes "Select the devide (serial port) to which your modem is<br>
  connected." The basic UDB has no modem, so press ENTER to select<br>
  "&lt;none&gt; : No Modem".<br>
<p>
* "Is your system clock set to local time or GMT?" Press ENTER to<br>
  select "ARC Time".<br>
<p>
* "Pick a time zone." DownArrow to your timezone, and press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* "Select a keymap." DownArrow to the correct selection ("us.map" for<br>
  the U.S.), and press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* "Do you want to create a user account?" Press ENTER to select "yes."<br>
<p>
* "Enter a name for the user account..." -- type "guest" (all<br>
  lowercase!) and press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* "If your home directories ... Do you want to create a home directory<br>
  for guest?" -- press ENTER to select "yes."<br>
<p>
* "Do you want to create another user account?" -- RightArrow to<br>
  select "No" and press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* "You will now enter a password for the root user (super-user). If<br>
  you forget this password, you must re-install the system!" -- Press<br>
  ENTER.<br>
<p>
* Now, in the black area at the bottom of the screen, you will see<br>
<p>
	Changing password for root<br>
	New password (? for help):<br>
<p>
  Type "root" (all lowercase, it won't echo), and press ENTER.<br>
<p>
	New password (again):<br>
<p>
  Again, type "root" and press RETURN.<br>
<p>
* The system will display a screen that says "Your installation is<br>
  finished... Shutdown now?" Press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* Now you will see a message that says "When you hit enter your<br>
  computer will be rebooted. Be sure to remove the boot floppy from<br>
  your floppy drive!" Press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* Remove the boot floppy, and insert the milo floppy.<br>
<p>
* Turn the power off, and then on again. (The UDB has no reboot<br>
  switch.)<br>
<p>
* Press ENTER to select "Boot floppy milo".<br>
<p>
* Ultimately the screen will go dark and you'll see a couple of milo<br>
  messages, culminating in the "MILO&gt;" prompt.<br>
<p>
  Type "boot sda2:vmlinux.gz" and press ENTER.<br>
<p>
  The system will now take a couple of minutes to boot...<br>
<p>
* You should now see the messages<br>
<p>
	Red Hat Linux release 2.1<br>
	Kernel 1.3.xx on a alpha<br>
<p>
	login:<br>
<p>
  Login as root (password "root").<br>
<p>
* Change the guest password:<br>
<p>
	1. Enter the command "passwd guest" and press ENTER.<br>
	2. At the bottom of the screen, you will see the message<br>
	   "/usr/lib/npasswd/npasswd.motd (END)" -- press the letter<br>
	   "q" (lowercase!)<br>
	3. Now, when it says "New password (? for help):", type<br>
	   "guest" (it won't echo) and press ENTER.<br>
	   To "New password (again):", again type "guest" and press<br>
	   ENTER.<br>
<p>
* With the milo &amp; linload.exe floppy installed enter the following <br>
  command (neatness counts a whole lot on this step, so be careful!)<br>
<p>
	dd if=/dev/fd0 of=/dev/sda1 bs=10240<br>
<p>
     Should look like this:<br>
<p>
	[root@dcg /root]# dd if=/dev/fd0 of=/dev/sda1 bs=10240<br>
	144+0 records in<br>
	144+0 records out<br>
	[root@dcg /root]# <br>
<p>
* Shutdown the system with the command "shutdown -h now".<br>
<p>
* When you get to the message "The system is halted, INIT: No more<br>
  processes left in runlevel 0," turn off the power, remove the milo<br>
  floppy, and turn the power back on.<br>
<p>
<p>
* When you get back to the blue screen, you will see a couple of<br>
  "Initializing ..." messages, and then a screen that says "Something<br>
  is inconsistent."<br>
<p>
  Finally, you will get to the boot menu. DownArrow to "Supplementary<br>
  menu...", and press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* DownArrow to "Set up the system..." and press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* DownArrow to "Manage boot selection menu..." and press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* "Add a boot selection..." should be highlighted now. Press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* "SCSI Bus 0 Hard Disk 0 Partition 1" should be highlighed now. (If<br>
  it isn't, downArrow to it. If it's not even there, downArrow to "New<br>
  system partition" and select it from there.) Press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* "Enter the osloader directory and name:" -- BACKSPACE over the<br>
  existing text and enter "linload.exe", the press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* "Is the operating system in the same partition as the osloader:" --<br>
  press ENTER to select "Yes."<br>
<p>
* "Enter the operating system root directory: -- BACKSPACE over the<br>
  existing text and enter "milo". <br>
<p>
* "Enter a name for this boot selection:" -- BACKSPACE over the <br>
  existing text, enter "LINUX", and press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* "Do you want to initialize the debugger at boot time:" -- press<br>
  ENTER to select "no."<br>
<p>
* ESC back one screen.<br>
<p>
* DownArrow to "Change a boot selection..."<br>
<p>
* Press ENTER to select "LINUX".<br>
<p>
* DownArrow to select OSLOADOPTIONS, and press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* BACKSPACE over the existing text "debugger" and type,<br>
  as above, enter "boot sda2:vmlinux.gz". Then press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* Press ESC (the "ESCAPE" key) to get back to the "Boot selections<br>

<p>
* "Should the system autoboot?" -- press ENTER to select "Yes."<br>
<p>
* "Enter Countdown value (in seconds): 10" -- BACKSPACE over "10" and<br>
  type "30", then press ENTER.<br>
<p>
* DownArrow to "Supplementary menu, and save changes...", and press<br>
  ENTER.<br>
<p>
* RESET system and it should now default to "LINUX" and boot up when count<br>
down time is reached.<br>
<p>
Notes:<br>
<p>
1. You should edit /etc/hosts to remove your own network address from<br>
   the system if you will be shipping the system to someone else.<br>
   (Just change the address from whatever you used originally to<br>
   "127.0.0.1".)<br>
<p>
============================================================================<br>
<p>
Configuring the X TGA server<br>
<p>
Preperation:<br>
Delete the old Xserver(selected during the redhat install)<br>
This is located in the dir: /usr/X11R6/bin/  usually called either XF86_S3<br>
or XF86_MACH64<br>
<p>
obtain the latest Xserver and README/Config file from either:<br>
<p>
ftp.digital.com/pub/Digital/Linux-Alpha/X11<br>
<p>
or<br>
<p>
on the Red Hat CD \X<br>
<p>
The files are:<br>
axpbin-Xtga-BETA-0.2.gz         ;Xserver<br>
axpbin-Xtga-BETA-0.2.README     ;README/Config<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From the CD do the following:</i><br>
<p>
root]# cd /<br>
root]# mount /dev/scd0 mnt<br>
root]# cd mnt<br>
root]# ls (should see the CD Rom)<br>
<p>
gunzip the Xserver<br>
copy/rename it to the dir: /usr/X11R6/bin/ renamed to XF86_TGA<br>
<p>
chmod 4711 XF86_TGA<br>
<p>
copy/rename the README to: /etc/X11  renamed to XF86Config<br>
edit it with vi comment out all the instructions in the beginning with #<br>
<p>
(This is at the top with notes from Jay Estabrook.  You have to comment )<br>
(out the notes or the X server will not start properly)<br>
<p>
from the root issue:<br>
ln -sf /usr/X11R6/bin/XF86_TGA /etc/X11/X<br>
<p>
this relinks the server to X windows<br>
<p>
type startx<br>
<p>
===========================================================================<br>
<p>
This should get the X server up and running.:-&gt;<br>
