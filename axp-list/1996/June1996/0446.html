<i>&gt; Well, for those of you who don't want to switch to a whole new driver</i><br>
<p>
What about this "whole new driver"? Are you speeking about a 3rd one?<br>
The original BSD driver and the Drew's driver are the same age.<br>
The current version of the BSD ncr driver for linux is very closed to the <br>
original one. Obviously, I have added some new code in order to take <br>
advantage of Linux and fixed some bugs (and perhaps added some bugs too).<br>
<p>
Scsi drivers, especially for ncr scsi controller, are very hard to write <br>
and to test.<br>
The FreeBSD ncr driver has been ported to NetBSD and Linux and IMHO can be <br>
adapted to other UNIX systems.<br>
<p>
As we share xfree86 drivers (S3,Mach64,etc..) among (free or not) unix systems, <br>
we should be able to share scsi drivers.<br>
IMHO, The only reason that may explain this situation is that free OSes must <br>
ensure support of POSIX, SYSV and/or BSD system services or emulations in order i<br>
to have some chance to be ever used. So, a xfree86 driver just need to map some <br>
IO space and physical memory (mmio, frame buffer) with system specific code <br>
and just run in user space.<br>
It is more easy to make them portable. No need to reinvent the wheel or to <br>
confront dynausors for that stuff.<br>
<p>
I would be very interested in the actual percentage of systems running a <br>
free UNIX and using a ncr53c8xx scsi controller.<br>
Dec Alpha hardware is a special case.<br>

<i>&gt; because of the ncr810 DISCONNECT bug, here is something to try: just</i><br>
<i>&gt; delete the following lines in linux/arch/alpha/kernel/irq.c:device_interrupt:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;	if (action) {</i><br>
<i>&gt;		/* quick interrupts get executed with no extra overhead */</i><br>
<i>&gt;		if (action-&gt;flags &amp; SA_INTERRUPT) {</i><br>
<i>&gt;			while (action) {</i><br>
<i>&gt;				action-&gt;handler(irq, action-&gt;dev_id, regs);</i><br>
<i>&gt;				action = action-&gt;next;</i><br>
<i>&gt;			}</i><br>
<i>&gt;			ack_irq(ack);</i><br>
<i>&gt;			return;</i><br>
<i>&gt;		}</i><br>
<i>&gt;	}</i><br>
<p>
Removing some code is a very nice way for debugging.<br>
Note that I just looked into the source code and I think that I've guessed <br>
something. IMHO, some other drivers will be happy of this change too.<br>
<p>
You can note the following too:<br>
We are currently using fast scsi-2 data transfer at up to 10 MB/sec with <br>
singled ended devices. IMMHO that is not recommended but I do it.<br>
However, I have checked that scsi parity checking is enabled for my hard disks <br>
and that the controller and the driver I use check scsi parity.<br>
<p>
Are pci scsi controllers from Buslogic and Adaptec supported under <br>
Linux/Alpha? (My question is perhaps silly since I just begin with Alpha systems <br>
and, at the moment, I donnot have access to Linux/Alpha boxes)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have tried this on a Cabriolet with disconnect enabled and have not</i><br>
<i>&gt; been able to crash the machine anymore.  Not proof positive, but it</i><br>
<i>&gt; looks good.  Could other people try this and let me know whether it</i><br>
<i>&gt; works?  In particular hearing from people with SCSI tape drives would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be interesting.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Linus found this bug while we were discussing how to best fix a bug in</i><br>
<i>&gt; _another_ driver (qlogicisp1020).  Turns out that both the Alpha</i><br>
<i>&gt; version and the x86 version had seemingly sane interpretation of what</i><br>
<i>&gt; the SA_INTERRUPT flag meant.  Problem is: the two interpretations were</i><br>
<i>&gt; different!  Overall, this had the effect of leading to race conditions</i><br>
<i>&gt; in certain drivers (notably the qlogicisp).  Now that everything is in</i><br>
<i>&gt; sync, it works much better.  It also means that for the Alpha, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; setting of SA_INTERRUPT has no effect whatsoever.</i><br>
