Hello:<br>
<p>
I am new to the list.  I've got an Alpha XL 233, with 32Mb of RAM, a 2 Gb <br>
drive, CD-ROM, and a SCSI bus.  The machine was purchased with intentions <br>
as a Windows NT file &amp; print server.<br>
<p>
With much prodding, I was able to convince the "powers that be" at my <br>
organization to let me try out Linux on Alpha, so that I may attempt to <br>
prove, over the summer, that it is an *free*, attractive alternative to <br>
NT.  We have been using Linux on an Intel box as an Internet server since <br>
October, and I must say it's worked splendidly.<br>
<p>
The purpose of my test is to demonstrate the Alpha as:<br>
<p>
- a file &amp; print server using SAMBA.<br>
- a network FAX server<br>
- an Internet server<br>
<p>
All tasks should be ideally suited to Linux.<br>
<p>
I have the go-ahead for this for the beginning of July, but I have a few <br>
questions before I begin.  The most worriesome to me is that the machine <br>
comes with a Matrox Millenium card, and I have since heard that Matrox is <br>
unwilling to provide programming information for the card without a <br>
non-disclosure agreement.  I had intentions of running X, to show that <br>
Linux can be just as "user friendly" as the next GUI.<br>
<p>
What are my options as far as the video card goes?  As long as I can run<br>
the card in 256 colour mode at least 640x480 it shouldn't be a problem. <br>
BTW...exchanging the card, nor buying a commercial X-server are *NOT*<br>
options -- heck, I can't even convince my organization to spring the $100<br>
on the Red Hat CD.  :-(  As I said, I am going to prove Linux's worth as a<br>
*free* alternative. <br>
<p>
I want to install the Red Hat 3.0.3 release from FTP.  From what little I <br>
know about Alpha Linux, I create some kind of boot floppy, and MILO <br>
floppies, and then from there I can perform the entire installation via <br>
FTP.  If so, this is ideal!<br>
<p>
I have visited the Alpha Linux home page at <br>
<a href="http://www.azstarnet.com/~axplinux/FAQ.html">http://www.azstarnet.com/~axplinux/FAQ.html</a> but it seems to be a little <br>
out-of-date as far as specific information on Red Hat goes.<br>
<p>
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  I'm really looking forward to<br>
trying out Linux on this beast.  Actually, it's keeping me awake at<br>
night.  :-)<br>
<p>
BTW...any chance the JE extensions are included in the Red Hat release?<br>
