<p>
This is true. I went in expecting not much in the way of performance, and was <br>
pleasntly suprised. I'd been told I should expect "about pentium-66 or -75" level <br>
perfomance, and am getting closer to pentium-120 or -133 performance. At least from <br>
what I can tell from BNB. <br>
 <br>

<p>
Thought it was 437 MHz 21164? And how is the 21264 coming along? Haven't heard much <br>
about it for a while. <br>
<p>
But I don't think that little multia box has the kind of air flow required to keep <br>
a 21164 cool. <br>
<p>
Ok you DEC experts (and/or employees) out there. I'm pretty new to the Alpha <br>
series, and am trying to get a handle on what processor does what.<br>
<p>
So far the list seems to be:<br>
<p>
21064AA<br>
21064A<br>
21066<br>
21068<br>
21164<br>
21164A (future?)<br>
21264  (future)<br>
<p>
What clock rates are/were those processors available in? Are all of them at least <br>
2-issue? Do the cores vary between the 21064 and 21066/21068? I take it "21064" <br>
means "21st century processor, 64 bit?" :) (had to ask)..<br>
<p>
I keep hearing "EV4, EV45, EV5, EV56" and gather that the "EV45 and EV56" are <br>
optical shrinks from the EV4 and EV5 - but what ARE the ev4 and ev5? I just got a <br>
166 MHz 21066-based UDB - what core is that, EV4 or EV45? <br>
<p>
Are there different revisions of the Alpha instruction set (similar to MIPS-I, <br>
MIPS-II, MIPS-III and MIPS-IV)? If there are, what are they? <br>
<p>
Where would I go about getting 21066 databooks? <br>
<p>
What are the better compilers for the 21066? I am aware that Microsoft has an Alpha <br>
emitting version of MSVC, but my local egghead salesman looked at me funny when I <br>
asked if they had that version of MSVC. <br>
<p>
What Operating Systems can the UDB run? I know NT 4.0 runs on it (running now) and <br>
know Linux runs on it. What about OpenVMS and OSF/1? <br>
<p>
Sorry for the battery of questions, just curious..<br>
