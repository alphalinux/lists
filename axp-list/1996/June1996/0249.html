Vareck Bostrom &lt;<a href="mailto:bostrov@teleport.com">bostrov@teleport.com</a>&gt; writes about the UDB:<br>
<i>&gt; I'd been told I should expect "about pentium-66 or -75" level perfomance,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and am getting closer to pentium-120 or -133 performance.</i><br>
<p>
My Pentium Amateur 133 MHz systems is noticably faster for non-floating-point<br>
applications than my 233 MHz Multia, so I would guess that a 166 MHz Multia<br>
would be a little slower than a 90 MHz Pentium Amateur.  Of course, a good<br>
bit of the performance difference is that GCC generates better code for<br>
the Pentium than for the Alpha.  As the Alpha GCC matures I'm sure the code<br>
quality will improve substantially.<br>

<i>&gt; Thought it was 437 MHz 21164?</i><br>
<p>
When they first announced it (i.e., working silicon, not a shipping product),<br>
they claimed 417 MHz, probably because that was what it took them to achieve<br>
500 SpecInt92.  They are shipping 366 MHz and 400 MHz, with 500 MHz expected<br>
before the end of the year.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And how is the 21264 coming along? Haven't heard much about it for a while. </i><br>
<p>
If you've heard anything about it at all, that's more than I have.  Please<br>
let me in on the secret!  :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But I don't think that little multia box has the kind of air flow required</i><br>
<i>&gt; to keep a 21164 cool. </i><br>
<p>
There would be a 3 W reduction in CPU power dissipation by switching from<br>
the 233 MHz 21066A to the 366 MHz 21164A.  The press release for the 417 MHz<br>
21164A gave a 20 W figure, the same as the published spec for the 266 MHz<br>
part.  Of course, other parts of the system might dissipate a bit more power,<br>
but since nothing else in the box is running anywhere near as fast as the CPU,<br>
this should be fairly minor.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ok you DEC experts (and/or employees) out there. I'm pretty new to the Alpha </i><br>
<i>&gt; series, and am trying to get a handle on what processor does what.</i><br>
<p>
You need a copy of "Alpha Implementations and Architecture" by Dileep P.<br>
Bhandarkar, Digital Press 1996, ISBN 1-55558-130-7, DEC order number<br>
EY-T141E-DP.  I can't wait to get the second edition! :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So far the list seems to be:</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 21064AA</i><br>
No such beast.  You probably mean 21064-AA, which was the part number for a<br>
150 MHz 21064 (i.e., not a 21064A)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 21164A (future?)</i><br>
Present.  (well, in my future)<br>
<p>
Here's a summary of the info I have at hand:<br>
<p>
	name	speed		part number	process		power supply<br>
----	------	-------		-----------	-------		------------<br>
EV4	21064	150 MHz		21064-AA	0.75 u		3.3 V 23 W<br>
EV4	21064	166 MHz		21064-CA	0.68 u		3.3 V<br>
EV4	21064	200 MHz		21064-BA	0.68 u		3.3 V 30 W<br>
<p>
LCA4	21066	166 MHz		21066-AA	0.68 u		3.3 V<br>
<p>
LCA4	21068	100 MHz		21068-AA	0.68 u		3.3 V<br>
<p>
EV45	21064A	200 MHz		21064-AB	0.5 u		3.3 V<br>
EV45	21064A	225 MHz		21064-BB	0.5 u		3.3 V<br>
EV45	21064A	233 MHz		21064-BB	0.5 u		3.3 V<br>
EV45	21064A	275 MHz		21064-DB	0.5 u		3.3 V 33 W<br>
EV45	21064A	300 MHz				0.5 u		3.3 V<br>
<p>
LCA45	21066A	233 MHz		21066-AB	0.5 u		3.3 V 23 W<br>
LCA45	21066A	166 MHz		21066-BB	0.5 u		3.3 V<br>
LCA45	21066A	100 MHz		21066-CB	0.5 u		3.3 V<br>
<p>
EV5	21164	266 MHz		21164-AA	0.5 u		3.3 V<br>
EV5	21164	300 MHz		21164-BA	0.5 u		3.3 V 50 W<br>
EV5	21164	333 MHz		21164-CA	0.5 u		3.3 V<br>
<p>
EV56	21164A	366 MHz		21164-EB	0.35 u		2.0 V 20 W<br>
EV56	21164A	400 MHz		21164-FB	0.35 u		2.0 V<br>
EV56	21164A	417 MHz				0.35 u		2.0 V 20 W<br>
<p>
Note that the same part number, 21064-BB, is used for 225 and 233 MHz rated<br>
parts.  Perhaps they raised the rating without changing the part number, or<br>
perhaps this is a type and the 233 MHz part is the conspicuously absent -CB.<br>
Compare "<a href="http://www.digital.com/info/Customer-Update/931025002.txt.html">http://www.digital.com/info/Customer-Update/931025002.txt.html</a>" and<br>
"<a href="http://www.digital.com/info/semiconductor/dsc-21064a.html">http://www.digital.com/info/semiconductor/dsc-21064a.html</a>".<br>
<p>
Mitsubishi, a licensed second source for Alpha Microprocessors, announced a<br>
200 MHz 21066 (not 21066A).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Do the cores vary between the 21064 and 21066/21068?</i><br>
<p>
The EV4 and LCA4 are nearly identical, as is the case for the EV45 and LCA45.<br>
<p>
The -45 cores have some improvements over the -4 cores.  In particular, the<br>
floating point divider has a shorter latency and produces the IEEE inexact<br>
result exception.  The 21064A has larger caches than the 21064, but the<br>
21066A cache didn't grow.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and gather that the "EV45 and EV56" are optical shrinks from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; EV4 and EV5</i><br>
<p>
They are not optical shrinks.  There was apparently an optical shrink<br>
from 0.75 u to 0.68 u for the 21064, but AFAIK it was still called an<br>
EV4.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Are there different revisions of the Alpha instruction set (similar to</i><br>
<i>&gt; MIPS-I, MIPS-II, MIPS-III and MIPS-IV)? If there are, what are they? </i><br>
<p>
I vaguely remember reading a reference to a particular version number of<br>
the architecture in some edition of the Alpha Architecture Handbook or the<br>
Alpha Architecture Reference Manual, but naturally I can't track it down<br>
right now.<br>
<p>
Several changes seem to have been made to the architecture will little<br>
fanfare between the publication of the first and second editions of the<br>
Alpha Architecture Reference Manual.  For instance, the WMB instruction was<br>
added in 2nd edition, but the note at the bottom of page C1 of 1st edition<br>
which specifically reserved not just the 18.4400 code point later used for<br>
WMB but also the 18.4800 and 18.4c00 for other weaker memory barriers.  Does<br>
this mean that new implementations are no longer required to treat 18.4800<br>
and 18.4c00 as memory barriers?<br>
<p>
The EV56 adds some new instructions including byte store.  About d*%$ time,<br>
if you ask me.  I've always been amused by the claim in the Alpha Architecture<br>
Reference Manual that one of the reasons for the lack of byte store is that<br>
"The Alpha AXP approach can make it easier to pipeline multiple byte<br>
operations."  In other words, by omitting a hardware capability, the programmer<br>
might be encouraged to come up with clever algorithms that handle multiple<br>
bytes at once.  Apparently the authors feel that if a byte store instruction<br>
were available, no one would bother to spend time figuring out how to speed<br>
things up.  In reality what more frequently happens is that a lazy programmer<br>
(or compiler) who doesn't have a store byte instruction will end up with<br>
really bad sequences of instructions.  Sure, writing better code would be the<br>
best solution, but having a byte store instruction would at least be somewhat<br>
of an improvement.  I guess they finally figured it out.  Of course, it's<br>
not going to help those of us with Multias, UDBs, and Nonames.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What Operating Systems can the UDB run? I know NT 4.0 runs on it (running</i><br>
<i>&gt; now) and know Linux runs on it. What about OpenVMS and OSF/1? </i><br>
<p>
Officially, the UDB only runs Linux :-)<br>
<p>
And the Multia only officially runs NT 3.5 or 3.51.  I've heard of people<br>
running Digital Unix (formerly OSF/1), but it is unsupported.  I've never<br>
heard of anyone trying OpenVMS, and can't imagine why anyone would want to.<br>
<p>
Anyone have a spare copy of the Alpha System Reference Manual (SRM)?<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
Eric<br>
