<i>&gt; I personally suspect that Digital has realized that no sane person wants</i><br>
<i>&gt; anything to do with NT, and that they are in danger of ending up with a</i><br>
<i>&gt; zillion units of shrinkwrapped NT and nothing to do with them short of</i><br>
<p>
I don't think that's even close to the real reason.<br>
<p>
I suspect the real story is that they figured out what a boo-boo they made<br>
when they soldered in the 166 MHz processors in the original model of the<br>
Multia (VX40) so they can't be upgraded.  They wound up with a warehouse<br>
of overstocked 166 MHz units.  People that really want Multias to run NT are<br>
buying the 233 MHz model.<br>
<p>
Both the UDB and the Easy Web Server were done as quick attempts to clear out<br>
the warehouse without losing too much money.  I suspect that they have<br>
discovered that the Easy Web Server is easier to sell and more profitable.<br>
<p>
Either that, or they have finally emptied the warehouse of 166 MHz machines.<br>
But there's no indication that the Easy Web Server is discontinued.  Of course,<br>
if it sells well they will migrate it to 233 MHz.<br>
<p>
The part of the story I don't understand is the recent "fire-sale" pricing<br>
on the UDB ($1199 list!), followed almost instantly by the discontinuation.<br>
If the warehouse was almost empty, they wouldn't have needed a fire-sale.<br>
OTOH, if they had lots of them the fire-sale would have taken longer than<br>
this to dump them.  Oh, well.  I guess that's why I'm an engineer and not a<br>
businessman.<br>
<p>
I'm disappointed that they aren't offering a 233 MHz UDB.  I guess the<br>
commitment to low-end Linux/Alpha systems which I praised them for a few<br>
days ago isn't so strong after all.  Sigh.<br>
<p>
I'm still waiting for that 21164A-based Multia.  Perhaps a VX-43?<br>
