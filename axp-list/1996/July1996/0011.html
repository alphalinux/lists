First of all:<br>
What do you base this belief on???<br>
The boards right now are IDENTICAL, except for the PROMs (which may be<br>
interchanged) The simple point here is that some people are confusing the<br>
fact that the board with a DEC UNIX license costs a lot more than the NT<br>
version with the idea that the board or CPU must be somehow magically better<br>
on the UNIX version. The fact is DEC UNIX is not cheap, especially on a<br>
higher performance Alpha. Yes, I realise it's the same UNIX, from the same<br>
CD installation media, however, it's not the software, it's the license that<br>
has a variable cost. The same license on a lower performance Alpha is MUCH<br>
cheaper. One other thing, licenses are NOT transferable.<br>
Secondly: I suggest you speak to someone from the DEC TOEM channel. The guys<br>
from the other channels are not well informed on this, as those divisions do<br>
not sell motherboards and CPU's. The only channel for these is the TOEM or<br>
embedded products group. Even the various DEC "distributors" actually buy<br>
their boards from the embedded products group, and technically speaking<br>
operate under the rule that they are not supposed to sell raw boards, only<br>
integrated complete systems.<br>

Again, WHAT INFORMATION do you base this idea on?<br>
Here's an excerpt from an email between myself and Vincent Ledoux (chief<br>
support engineer, Digital of Canada) on the new boards coming from Digital.<br>
Please note that we are being told that once again, the boards are the same,<br>
other than the PROMs and UNIX license choice.<br>

"We just announced the 500 Mhz 21164 Alpha processor, available now for samples<br>
and in quantity in a few months. We will be releasing the 433 Mhz motherboard<br>
soon, but I still have no firm date.<br>
I should know more in 2 weeks as when new complete motherboards will be<br>
available at 433 and 500 Mhz. The next version should be ATX form factor,<br>
thus will clean fit in any ATX enclosure without the need of a special<br>
3.3V power supply as the ATX standard has 3.3 volts.<br>
(see: <a href="http://www.x86.org/intel.doc/IntelDocs.html">http://www.x86.org/intel.doc/IntelDocs.html</a> for ATX ond other specs.)<br>
It is about time these clone manufacturers standardize on something.<br>
Already a bunch of Intel clones are available in ATX format.<br>
Linux, as far as I know uses the ARC console to run the program that allows<br>
it to boot.  If the ARC sees the drives (Display system configuration menu)<br>
it should be able to boot from it.  We unfortunately do not support, but <br>
encourage the use of Linux.  Our European division is quite big on Linux.<br>
This is not expected to change."<br>

Maurice Hilarius (<a href="mailto:maurice@ellpspace.math.ualberta.ca">maurice@ellpspace.math.ualberta.ca</a>) of Hard Data :<br>
I simply want to make sure we clear the air here, for once and for all. The<br>
"old" 21066A chips, Jensens, and "no-Name" Alphas, while interesting , are<br>
not very fast by modern standards. There is an amount of clearance stock<br>
being blown out by Digital right now on some of this old stuff, but, quite<br>
frankly, if people are looking for modern Alpha performance, then the only<br>
real choices are the current Alpha PCI-64 (21064A/275 with 2MB cache) or<br>
Alpha PCI-164 (21164/266 or 300, 2MB cache) boards. The rest are simply<br>
obsolete relics by todays standards. To go to great lengths to get Linux<br>
running on a UDB 166 is silly, as a Pentium 166 offers the same performance,<br>
at a much smaller price in terms of compatibility.<br>
One last note: how cheap are the old 21066A's?? Well, we are selling the<br>
Digital "Easy Web Server" which is a 21066A/166 in a UDB(small enclosure)<br>
with 32MB RAM, 1GB SCSI, Ethernet, 2MB TGA video, NT, Netscape Server, and<br>
all the various accessories for the grand sum of $ 1350 (U.S. Dollars) right<br>
now, while supplies last. keyboard, mouse and monitor are additional. With a<br>
Logitech Mouseman, Fujitsu keyboard, and a Wyse 15" monitor, this will set<br>
you back $1875 (U.S. Dollars). Yes, it's cheap, but be warned, it's just not<br>
exceptionally fast. If an experimental machine is what you want , fine! But<br>
if it's performance you seek, look to the newer stuff.<br>

        Cheers,<br>
