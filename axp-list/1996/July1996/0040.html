<i>&gt;Unfortunately, at this site the only monitor I've got too hook up to the thing</i><br>
<i>&gt;is an old IBM VGA monitor.  It can't do SVGA resolutions at all -- it really</i><br>
<i>&gt;maxes out at 640x480.</i><br>
<p>
Should be enough; the UDB can be told to generate that...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I tried plugging it into the UDB and booting.  I got a couple of test</i><br>
<i>&gt;patterns at first, and then I seemed to get the colorful snow that one gets</i><br>
<i>&gt;when one has a messed up XFree86 configuration file.  I'm guessing that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;UDB is immediately trying to go to more than 640x480 resolution.</i><br>
<p>
Most likely; they're normally configured to 1024x768@ 72 HZ, some even<br>
as high as 1280x1024 @ 70Hz... :-(<br>
<p>
However, it only stays in the higher resolution briefly, UNLESS the console<br>
is configured to stay in SRM console mode, and NOT go to ARC mode. ARC mode<br>
ignores the jumper settings and does 640x480 @ 60Hz or some such, so it should<br>
work on most monitors. If your UDB does NOT finally go to a good video mode,<br>
I hope the brief fling at a higher resolution hasn't damaged the monitor... :-(<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Is this what's going on, or is it more likely that the monitor is faulty?</i><br>
<i>&gt;This monitor appears to work just fine with an Intel NT box at 640x480x256.</i><br>
<p>
No, I think you've surmised correctly; hopefully it *still* works correctly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If the UDB is trying something outside this monitor's specs, is there a way to</i><br>
<i>&gt;ask it not to?  Perhaps a jumper on the motherboard?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, there *are* jumpers on the MB that you can set to tell the console FW<br>
what resolution you wish to use. I'll try to walk you through finding and<br>
setting them, but you should feel comfortable opening boxes up and groping<br>
around before you start... :-)<br>
<p>
Note that I'm doing this with a 166 UDB as the model, but I think the jumpers<br>
are located the same on either version of the MB.<br>
<p>
0. Orient the box in your lap or on a table with the front to your left and<br>
   back to your right.<br>
<p>
1. Open the box (unscrew the knurled knobs on the back) and slowly pull out<br>
the MB/drawer. You'll have to remove a couple of wire connectors for the<br>
power soon after you start pulling it open. They are at the top right of<br>
the MB. Pull up on them to disconnect. REMEMBER THE LOCATIONS, but they<br>
   are keyed if you forget.<br>
<p>
2. Look at the bottom<br>
   of the MB, just to the right of center; there's a block of 8 VRAM memory<br>
   chips for the graphics. Look above them and try to find a block of four<br>
(4)     jumpers, arranged in a box shape.They are usually set in a<br>
particular way       (see below) and are the only set of four (that I can<br>
remember) in a box         shape. They should be easily accessible, ie not<br>
under anything else, UNLESS<br>
   you have an internal 3.5" SCSI drive in there, and then you'll have to<br>
   remove it to get access to the MB and the jumpers.<br>
<p>
   The jumpers will prolly look like:<br>
<p>
          . .  . .<br>
          ._.  ._.<br>
<p>
3. Change the jumpers to look like:<br>
<p>
          ._.  . .<br>
          ._.  . .<br>
<p>
This should give you 640x480 @ 60 HZ, just what the doctor ordered... :-)<br>
<p>
Good luck, and let me know if you have any problems.<br>
