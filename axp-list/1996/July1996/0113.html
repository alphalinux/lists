It is my pleasure to announce that the GNU libc/ELF based Linux/Alpha<br>
system is now self-hosting.  This means that many packages starting<br>
from aboot all the way to zlib has been built against glibc and with<br>
shared libraries.  Even the nasty bits such as the kernel and the<br>
PALcode have been built with the ELF tools.  The only exception to<br>
this rule is the X server---the machine I'm doing this on has a TGA,<br>
for which there is no server source code yet.  By now, the Linux<br>
kernel, GNU C library, X11 libraries and clients, Emacs, as well as<br>
several many packages have been built with the self-hosted system.<br>
<p>
The result is quite impressive: what I have built so far fits on a<br>
single 1GB drive with room to spare (and that includes all the<br>
sources!).  In fact, not counting the sources on that drive, the<br>
system takes up about 252MB of disk space.  Of course, this is not a<br>
complete installation (e.g., TeX has not been built yet), but it does<br>
include your basic X11 system, Emacs, etc.  As more X binaries are<br>
built, the disk-space saved due to shared libraries will become even<br>
more significant.<br>
<p>
So what's the point of this announcement?  Well, if you're a<br>
distributor, this is probably a good point to start switching to<br>
glibc/ELF.  To avoid painful experiences, it may be better for<br>
"end-users" to wait for such a distribution to arrive.  The reason for<br>
this is two-fold.  First, upgrading incrementally is difficult because<br>
the include files changed completely and because several important<br>
system files changed their file format (e.g., utmp, I think the<br>
timezone file may be different, too).  Second, some key tools needed<br>
to build the ELF/glibc system are based on pre-releases which cannot<br>
be made available widely.  But for those that want ELF/glibc really<br>
bad and _now_, feel free to join the <a href="mailto:axplinux-libc@azstarnet.com">axplinux-libc@azstarnet.com</a><br>
majordomo mailing list and get it going yourself.  As I said in an<br>
earlier mail: be prepared for more than a weekend's worth of<br>
work... ;-)<br>
<p>
Some credit to the giants on whose shoulders this effort rests:<br>
<p>
First, and foremost, thank Richard Henderson and Eric Youngdale for<br>
their excellent ELF, dynamic-linker, and binutils work (and everything<br>
else I forgot to mention).<br>
<p>
As for glibc, Roland McGrath (FSF) and Ulrich Drepper (Cygnus) have<br>
done a tremendous job in fixing bugs and bringing glibc up to snuff.<br>
They also have been very patient in dealing with my constant prodding<br>
and pushing.  That alone should speak volumes... :-))<br>
<p>
Last but not least, much thanks to DEC Semiconductor for being so<br>
generous in supporting Linux/Alpha development.  Having a machine that<br>
builds stuff faster than I can reach for a cup of coffee helps a lot<br>
in keeping caffeine at a non-lethal level... ;-)<br>
<p>
If you want to get serious about moving to glibc/ELF, it's best to<br>
discuss the details on <a href="mailto:axplinux-libc@azstarnet.com">axplinux-libc@azstarnet.com</a>.  A README file<br>
with some initial instructions is at:<br>

<p>
Enjoy,<br>
