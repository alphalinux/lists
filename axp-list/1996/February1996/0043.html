<i>&gt; I'm actually using aboot 0.3... for some strange reason, I'm a little </i><br>
<i>&gt; reluctant to blow away flashware, and SRM w/aboot is more familiar </i><br>
<i>&gt; SunOS/BSD territory for me.  But your pointer to bios32.c was very </i><br>
<i>&gt; helpful.</i><br>
<p>
You should be able to switch over to the ARC console and not blow away<br>
anything. However, booting via ARC normally requires having a small (2Mb)<br>
partition to hold the MILO and linload executables in, a bit of a bother<br>
when compared to SRM/aboot. That said, MILO has been enhanced recently to<br>
allow boots from off the CDROM for CD distribution installs, which I think<br>
neither SRM nor aboot support?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Just for kicks, I tried physically swapping the TGA and the DE435 PCI </i><br>
<i>&gt; cards, but IRQ 9 moved with the DE435.  It weirded me out for a second, </i><br>
<i>&gt; but seemed to make it clear that maybe what I really wanted to do was </i><br>
<i>&gt; tell bios32.c either that interrupt 9 wasn't available for allocation </i><br>
<i>&gt; (since it isn't, eh?), or at least sort it behind my only remaining </i><br>
<i>&gt; unused PCI interrupt - IRQ 10.  Having done the latter, I'm still having </i><br>
<i>&gt; the same trouble with hearing traffic, but the card did take IRQ 10 (and </i><br>
<i>&gt; a lot of &lt;sc ...&gt; console errors went away), so I think I'm on the right </i><br>
<i>&gt; track.</i><br>
<p>
It could be that the SRM console is assigning the IRQs it wants, regardless<br>
of the slots things appear in.<br>
<p>
Do a "cat /proc/pci" to ensure that the IRQ's are what you expect, and that<br>
there aren't any other conflicts, if you haven't already. Also, what does<br>
"cat /proc/interrupts" say? Does it agree with "ifconfig"?<br>
<p>
Also, in re: the "flood ping" results from your later mail, is there any<br>
chance that eth0 has not been "routed"? Can't imagine why the interface<br>
doesn't show the outgoing ping messages in the count, although if it's not<br>
interrupting, perhaps it doesn't count them as sent? I dunno... :-(<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; The card has jumpers for rehoming the I/O base address, but apparently </i><br>
<i>&gt; not the IRQ.  The AlphaStation 250 User Information manual says that the </i><br>
<i>&gt; PCXBJ device sits on slot 2, at IOBASE 530, 388 (eh?), with DMAmode and </i><br>
<i>&gt; chan 0, 1 (eh?), and IRQ 9.  SRM's "iconfig" utility tells me that SRM's </i><br>
<i>&gt; add_sound macro chooses I/O 530, IRQ 9, and DMA 0.  That's why I tried </i><br>
<i>&gt; using DMA 0, at least.  Having worked around the IRQ issue, I'm leaving </i><br>
<i>&gt; the sound device unconfigured for now, though I'd like to get it working </i><br>
<i>&gt; at some point.</i><br>
<p>
The 530 is for the CS chip, the 388 is the standard for the OPL FM syth<br>
chip, I believe. I don't know why it talks about *2* DMA channels; usually<br>
if there are 2, one is 8-bit, the other 16, but 0 and 1 are 8-bit; maybe one<br>
for the OPL as well? Dunno...  And, yeah, if it seems to want DMA 0, go with<br>
it...<br>
