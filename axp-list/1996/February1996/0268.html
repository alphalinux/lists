All,<br>
	I've been thinking about how to deterministically reboot linux to<br>
Milo such that Milo does the right things.   I've some ideas, but rather than<br>
just implement what seems neat/useful to me, I'm throwing it open to the<br>
net.   Here's my thinking on this.<br>
<p>
(1) Alpha Linux should behave pretty much as per Intel Linux and if<br>
possible even better.  That means that:<br>
<p>
	"shutdown -h now" gets the system to a point where you can turn<br>
	the power off,<br>
	"shutdown -r now" should fully reboot the system.<br>
<p>
(2) Fully rebooting the system is somewhat tricky.  Where we booted via<br>
WNT ARC, that would mean reloading and restarting it (most processors <br>
do not have reset under software control).   By the time Linux runs,<br>
the WNT ARC loader has been destroyed.  This would mean that every system<br>
would have to know how it booted and how to get itself back to where<br>
it started.  Resetting back to Milo and Milo doing sensible things (to<br>
be defined) is acceptable.  This solves the rebooting a remote server<br>
problem.<br>
<p>
(3) Leaving a compressed version of Milo in memory is not a problem<br>
and getting back to milo from linux is not a problem.  This already<br>
works, the halt PALcall jumps into the start of the "console", in this<br>
case Milo.<br>
<p>
(4) What is a sensible set of things to do in Milo when Linux halts<br>
back to it?<br>
	(a) Execute the same boot command as the one that booted Linux<br>
	last time,<br>
	(b) Allow the user to interrupt that reboot if he/she wants to<br>
	do something else.<br>
<p>
(5) I quite like the idea of a patchable parameter block (like rdev on <br>
zImage) that users can use as a way of modifying/personalising Milo for<br>
their own systems.   So, to make the default boot device /dev/sdb2 they<br>
might use something like<br>
<p>
	mdev -b/dev/sda2 milo<br>
<p>
to set the argument block up.   This argument block would contain:<br>
	(a) memory size override value,<br>
	(b) default boot device<br>
	(c) default root device<br>
	(d) default boot string<br>
	(e) autoboot (with timeout)<br>
<p>
(6) Multiple argument blocks are possible.  In other words, Milo could<br>
have a set of three possible boots with three possible sets of boot<br>
arguments.  It would then try each in turn.   All this takes is memory.<br>
<p>
(7) The WNT ARC loader (linload) passes the memory size and a command line<br>
to Milo.   The command line is treated as the first command to execute<br>
and the memory size overrides anything that Milo might figure out for itself.<br>
These values would have to be merged with the argument block's values.<br>
<p>
(8) Environment variables are a "problem".  Again, they could be merged<br>
with the boot block values but I've almost convinced myself that we <br>
really don't need them.  Don't forget that there are some systems where<br>
Milo does not have access to NVRAM and so this _must_ work without <br>
NVRAM.<br>
