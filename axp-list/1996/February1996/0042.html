Hi,<br>
<p>
I just got a new Alpha and joined this list to get the last word on getting  <br>
Linux up and running...<br>
<p>
I saw a post from Akio Morita on f2c (now in the redhat archives).  <br>
<p>
<p>
F2c is not just for small programs.  I have used it for 4 years now on various  <br>
platforms where I don't have  a native f77 compiler.  I have compiled literally  <br>
millions of lines of Fortran, in large programs as well as small.  F2c combined  <br>
with gcc has proved to be one of the most reliable "fortran compilers" I have  <br>
used and frequently finds bugs in programs that other compilers miss.  Note  <br>
that f2c does no optimization, only translation.  Any optimization is in the C  <br>
compile of the translated code, so the C compiler is the key.  The g77  <br>
compiler, although a native compiler that could do more optimization since it  <br>
starts with fortran source, produces slower code than f2c/gcc and has only  <br>
recently gotten debugged enough to compile large applications without having to  <br>
substitute f2c/gcc compiles for the buggy modules.  The speed of code from the  <br>
f2c/gcc combination is typically 70%-90% of that from a native fortran  <br>
compiler.  This speed difference is greater for RISC machines (such as the HP,  <br>
the MIPS processors or the Alpha) where the consequences of bad instruction  <br>
scheduling are more serious and factors of 2x or 3x are possible between  <br>
f2c/gcc and native f77 compiled code.<br>
<p>
Comparing DOS or NT native compilers to any of the GNU compilers (g77,f2c/gcc)  <br>
shows that the GNU compiler optimizations on the Pentium are not as good as  <br>
those from vendors that have used Intel's optimizations.  On a 90 mhz Pentium  <br>
Watcom F77 under DOS or NT maxes out on Linpack at 18 MFLOPS or so, f2c/gcc  <br>
produces 11 MFLOPS, g77 gives 9 MFLOPS.  There is obviously much room for  <br>
improvement here.  <br>
<p>
<p>
One bright spot on the Linux compiler horizon may be that MicroWay (Kingston,  <br>
MA) is porting their NDP optimizing compilers (F77, F90, C, C++, Pascal) to run  <br>
under Linux on both the Pentium and on the Alpha.  They are not ready yet, I  <br>
talked to them yesterday, but they are working on the library compatibility  <br>
issues now and tuning the Alpha code generator.  These are obviously commercial  <br>
compilers, not freeware, but may offer a way to produce much faster code under  <br>
Linux.  In the meantime, f2c/gcc and g77 are the only way to compile fortran  <br>
under Linux on the Alpha.  Hopefully, I should have some timing comparisons for  <br>
Linux f2c/gcc vs DEC f77 in the next week or so.<br>
