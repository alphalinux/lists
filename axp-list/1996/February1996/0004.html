[please let me know if you'd prefer continued discussion of this to <br>
leave the list - its getting a touch off focus!]<br>
<p>
} &gt;Personally I think that the Alpha machine (a standard noname in our case)<br>
} does &gt;not *feel* at all nippy - despite the whopping BogoMIPs figure.<br>
} <br>
} Even compared to a simple Pentium Box ?<br>
<p>
OK, I stressed the "feel" because that is all I am basing my <br>
statements on.<br>
A Kernel compile takes around twice as long on a 32MB alpha 133 <br>
noname, than on a Pentium 75 8MB (and the speed of the pentium <br>
effectively doubles with 16MB).  These "figures" are finger in the <br>
air guesstimates.   Also I tend to compile using batch and leave the <br>
system to it, so my measurements are rather dependant on me seeing <br>
incoming mail!<br>
<p>
When the compiler gets better this will improve a lot.<br>
<p>
A while back I tried the byte benchmarks.  They took some hacking to <br>
compile (the standard long == 32 bits problem, with a new twist), but <br>
when I did get them going the results were basically that raw compute <br>
power (dhrystones) is good, and the stuff that was OS dependant was <br>
very slow.  Overall it came well down the pentium range.<br>
<p>
Now there is a bright side to this for people like thee and me that <br>
want to use the things as servers.  If it will do the job now, in 6 <br>
months time when compiler and libraries get better and the kernel <br>
optomisation is better (look at the i386 string ops for example - all <br>
optomised assembler), the machine will get faster.  Your hardware <br>
investment should keep going longer (the flip side is that you are <br>
crippling it at the start).<br>
<p>
} As far as web server, do you think is better a forking or not forking server? <br>
} My own software is quite small and doesn't use external libs and so no<br>
} problems.<br>
<p>
I would expect apache, with the pre-forking model, to be as good as <br>
anything available for web serving on the alpha.<br>
<p>
} &gt;Also, for our application, the inability to reboot is an absolute killer.<br>
} A system that goes down and stays down is not good!<br>
} <br>
} What do you mean? I can't issue a reboot command? Or what?<br>
<p>
The system goes through the shutdown procedure OK, but then cannot <br>
bootstrap itself back up again.  A manual reset is currently <br>
required.  This must be fixable - they have done it for NetBSD, but <br>
then their loader is rather different I imagine.<br>
<p>
A side effect of this will be that a crash will hang the system, not <br>
reboot.<br>
<p>
} I'm going to order the noname these days...what firmware I've to ask to run<br>
} Linux (Red Hat or Blade distribution!?!??)<br>
<p>
Have a look at the FAQ - its linked from the redhat alpha web pages.<br>
I think (from memory - and its not my field), that either will work fine, so you should choose the one with the lowest licensing costs!  [NT firmware will work with NetBSD if you want the choice]<br>
