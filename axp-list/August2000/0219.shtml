<P>
Not to ask the obvious question...But did you adjust the SRM variables
<BR>
ewa0_mode appropriately for these cards?  I've never run our cards here at
<BR>
full duplex, but to get 100Mbit with half-duplex I need to remember to set
<BR>
ewa0_mode to &quot;Fast&quot; because a setting of &quot;Twisted-Pair&quot; is only 10Mbit.
<BR>
<P>Just a thought...

Subject: DS-10 Networking problems
<BR>
<P><P>Hi folks, just a quick question, but one that has made my life a misery
<BR>
lately.
<BR>
<P>We have 7 DS-10s here, and the ultimate intention is to use them as a
<BR>
Beowulf cluster. What's stopping us right now is utterly pathetic
<BR>
network performance. Has anyone EVER got a DS-10 to run its ethernet
<BR>
adapter at 100Mbit/s, full duplex? I'm the latest in a long line of
<BR>
people to try on these particular machines, and we're all totally
<BR>
stumped.
<BR>
<P>The tulip drivers we can switch over to 100Mbit/FDX without much drama,
<BR>
and it works fine as long as the packet size is below 6k - anything
<BR>
larger than that and we drop to about 1Mbit/s. The de4x5 drivers won't
<BR>
even go off of 10Mb/s ... but it doesn't seem to be driver related. We
<BR>
got a bunch of Intel EtherExpress cards earlier in the week, and they
<BR>
performed dismally as well. We've gone through several kernels from
<BR>
2.2.13 to 2.4.0-test6. We've tried another switch. To totally deflate my
<BR>
optimism, we had a guy here who took up Compaq's test drive offer and
<BR>
found out that their machines have pretty dismal network performance as
<BR>
well.
<BR>
<P>I'm living in hope that somebody knows what's going on. If anyone needs
<BR>
to know more, I can talk to some of the other people who have bashed
<BR>
their heads against this problem and get pretty much any info anyone
<BR>
would like.
<BR>
<P>If anyone can offer any useful suggestions, thanks. I'm off to sit in a
<BR>
corner and dribble.
<BR>
<P>Mike.
