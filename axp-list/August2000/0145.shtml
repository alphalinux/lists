<EM>&gt; The cool way of doing it would be to retain partition info for volumes.

<P>'sfdisk' from util-linux will write this information in a form which
<BR>
is suitable for feeding it back to 'sfdisk' to repartition drives but
<BR>
it does that on a disk-by-disk basis.  True, it assumes that a partition
<BR>
table used is of &quot;FAT type&quot;.
<BR>
<P>I wrote a somewhat similar tool, called 'bdsfdisk', (less complicated
<BR>
and capable than 'sfdisk')  which writes from stdin data &quot;BSD type&quot;
<BR>
labels of a kind used by Linux on Alpha.  The later means, among other
<BR>
things, no support for &quot;BSD subpartitions&quot; hidden in &quot;FAT partitions&quot;
<BR>
like used by various BSD* cousins as this was not needed.
<BR>
<P>The above does not store all this info on a tape which means that you
<BR>
would have to keep that, say, on a floppy and to know where it is after
<BR>
a disaster. :-) Probably together with a copy of fstab and other
<BR>
relevant information.  You would have to boot to a ramdisk and
<BR>
repartition your disks using this info before restoring.  OTOH this is
<BR>
likely such infrequent event that I am not sure if more effort in making
<BR>
such tools would be really warranted.  But if somebody feels
<BR>
otherwise then fire up your editors.
