<P>
I've got an AlphaStation 200 and had some difficulties getting from ARC back
<BR>
to SRM.  What I ended needing to do was to make a firmware floppy
<BR>
(instructions were on DEC's firmware site).  Once I had that, I went to the
<BR>
&quot;Upgrade Firmware&quot; option of ARC, and when I got to the firmware update
<BR>
menu, I did a Ctrl-P (it may have been prior to the menu, it was awhile ago
<BR>
and I can't remember exactly where it was).  This brought me to an SRM
<BR>
prompt.  I set &quot;OS_TYPE&quot; back to UNIX and power-cycled.  Then I did a `b
<BR>
dva0` to boot off of the floppy and loaded SRM (update SRM at the prompt).
<BR>
<P>This was much cleaner than the previous time when I just pulled the battery
<BR>
off of the motherboard and when I put it back in, I had an SRM (and an error
<BR>
about my sound device not being in the ISA config).

<P><P>Sorry to followup my own post.  Jim B.  provided some real good poop,
<BR>
especially about checking the serial console.  Problem at this point
<BR>
is that while I get a bunch of options on the serial console, I don't
<BR>
seem to be able to pick the one I want.  And there's never an Apu-&gt;
<BR>
prompt (this is v7 of the f/w update).  It let me put ARC 4.58 on,
<BR>
but that does not an SRM console make.  Anyone been through this
<BR>
specific scenario?  I have a copy of the vid card that was in it when
<BR>
I got it due any day now.  That may let it come up in console=graphics
<BR>
which may get me through this.  More clues??
<BR>
thanx,
<BR>

<EM>&gt; Hi folks --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I just retrieved a loaner AS200 that has ARC 4.57 firmware.  I need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; load SRM back on the box.  IIRC, all I should have to do is copy the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as200_v6_9.exe or as200_v7_0.exe to a floppy or cd as fwupdate.exe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and run the Update Firmware option from the ARC menu.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Once I got past a bunch of floppy errors (I really need to buy some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; media), I got to the point where it spends a bunch of time reading the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; floppy and sits there with a blank blue screen forever.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I skinned the box and found a Jaton (cheap white-box) S3Virge video card
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in it.  Is this the problem?  I prolly should stick in something that's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supported by DU anyway......
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Answers/Comments/Suggetions?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thanx,
