Hello AXP/Linux people,
<BR>
<P>I was wondering about file system performance on Alpha Linux systems.
<BR>
Having no experience with such configurations (will get one soon), I
<BR>
have no idea how efficient (or not) the &quot;standard&quot; Linux file system
<BR>
is on Alpha.
<BR>
<P>I read that SGI has ported XFS to their Linux systems, but it seems to
<BR>
be very specific to their systems.  Is there something equivalent for
<BR>
Alpha Linux?  Something that gives the option of direct I/O (no file
<BR>
system caching) like XFS would be very good to have.  I'd hate to see
<BR>
something like, for example, connecting a FCAL RAID system capable of
<BR>
over 100 MB/s transfer rate to my new Alpha Linux box and see no more
<BR>
than 20-30 MB/s of effective throughput due to file system overhead.
<BR>
<P>One thing I was looking at is GFS (Global File System), which offers
<BR>
direct concurrent access to the same file systems by multiple hosts.
<BR>
This feature is highly desirable as well, but I have no information
<BR>
on how efficient it is.  It also only works with certain hardware with
<BR>
support for certain SCSI extensions.
<BR>
<P>thanks for any information you can provide.
<BR>
eyc
