<P>On building RPMs, every now and then the compiler will die during a build.  I
<BR>
can always rpm -bc --short-circuit to finish the compile, but there is no
<BR>
short-circuit of rpm -bb.  If the package is already compiled, is there any way
<BR>
to jump past the prep, compile, and install stages straight to building a
<BR>
binary?
