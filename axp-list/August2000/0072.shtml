<P>Out of sheer curiosity - do you only think that &quot;should be&quot; or somebody

actually measured some performance differences for ssh compiled both

are well known.

<P>I would suspect that in a situation where one is limited mostly by

a bandwidth of a communication channel finding visible performance
<BR>
differences, and of that sort which are really significant in practice,
<BR>
would be really hard.  But maybe somebody can _show_ that I am mistaken

here?
