<EM>&gt; That's a good question. After looking at the man page it appears that

<EM>&gt; there no way

<EM>&gt; to get around that.

<P>Absolutely on purpose; in order to prevent sneaking in a weird stuff
<BR>
and manual interventions when making final archives.

<P><EM>&gt; I would suck having to rebuild all those object
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; files. Might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we benfit by hacking the rpm source? :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>It is possible to create and use another spec file which will be doing
<BR>
mostly nothing until an installation phase.  Like one for Netscape from
<BR>
DU. :-) Techically this will be a different rpm archive then the one you
<BR>
tried to build in the first place.  Either redefine prep to do mostly
<BR>
nothing or prepare &quot;sources&quot; from your current compilation tree.
<BR>
Do not unpack on the top what you compiled or you will be starting
<BR>
from scratch again.  The first action in a normal prep is 'rm -rf ...'.
