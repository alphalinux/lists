<EM>&gt; As far as the API 1100 . . . Is anyone selling them?  I have several SX boxes I

<P>Check the reseller's list at API and call one. I know that you dont see

them activly adverised on vendor's sites yet (why?). but people are

buying them. BTW USB works

on this i 2.4.0-7

<P><P><EM>&gt; I've had some success with commenting out the prep and build directories of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some .spec files.  You just have to remember to add things like cd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/app_path in the %install section.  This works as long as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things set in %prep are not needed in the %install.  Which means the the kde
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; source rpms can't work that way (they require several file settings).

<P>Yup that makes sense.

<EM>&gt; I personally think the idea of adding -bb -ba -bs to the short-circuit of rpm is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; great.  Anybody else want to give it a shot?  ;)  For the people that have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worked on rpm it doesn't seem like that hard of a feature to add.  (spoken
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like a person who hasn't even looked at the source). Of course an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rpm -bb --continue_failed would be best.
</EM><BR>
<P>it doesnt sound too difficult to implement (i say that now). I'll give
<BR>
it a shot.
