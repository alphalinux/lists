<P>
<EM>&gt; Free (or really cheap) is the bassis of Beowulf systems, and it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; definitely my preference, unless there is something significant to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be gained by paying such significant prices.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, that's a fine attitude. What CVFS gives you today is a proven,
<BR>
reliable, heterogeneous SAN filesystem. When we got to the install phase at
<BR>
FSL, GFS's journaling version was 2 months away, and it's still 2 months
<BR>
away. GFS is only on Linux, and it hasn't received enough real world testing
<BR>
for me to stare my clients in the eye and promise that it won't eat all
<BR>
their data once a year.
<BR>
<P>These qualities may or may not be important to you. And GFS will undoubtedly
<BR>
be better in 6 months.
