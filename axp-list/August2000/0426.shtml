<P>
As far as the API 1100 . . . Is anyone selling them?  I have several SX boxes I
<BR>
want to replace.
<BR>
<P>I've had some success with commenting out the prep and build directories of
<BR>
some .spec files.  You just have to remember to add things like cd
<BR>
/usr/src/redhat/BUILD/app_path in the %install section.  This works as long as
<BR>
things set in %prep are not needed in the %install.  Which means the the kde
<BR>
source rpms can't work that way (they require several file settings).
<BR>
<P>I personally think the idea of adding -bb -ba -bs to the short-circuit of rpm is
<BR>
great.  Anybody else want to give it a shot?  ;)  For the people that have
<BR>
worked on rpm it doesn't seem like that hard of a feature to add.  (spoken
<BR>
like a person who hasn't even looked at the source). Of course an 
<BR>
rpm -bb --continue_failed would be best.
