<P>
for one, to access a drive on unix as a device you access it as rrz??c on
<BR>
unix (true64), the &quot;c&quot; label spans the entire drive.  If you install linux
<BR>
on it you would over-write data in partition a and b. Didn't say it could
<BR>
not be done, you will have to muck with the partitions and make sure the
<BR>
ones you use do not overlap.

<P>I agree.  But this is a question of rather limited capabilities of a
<BR>
boot loaders then partitioning.  That one from Tru64 seems to have
<BR>
really thin options about what and from where to load.  'aboot' used
<BR>
with Linux can easily load few different installation of Linux from the
<BR>
same disk (see 'aboot' docs for details and in particular how to specify
<BR>
a partition on which a boot image resides) but I doubt that it can load
<BR>
Tru64.  So, if you would have both Tru64 and Linux on the same drive
<BR>
then you would have to leave a boot block to Tru64 loader and you would
<BR>
have to start 'aboot' from a different media (floppy, CD or ... another
<BR>
hard disk).
<BR>
<P>I have no idea if one can make 'aboot' to load FreeBSD.  Not
<BR>
&quot;out-of-the-box&quot; but maybe some hacking is feasible?
