<P>
I'm porting to Alpha Linux.  I have a development
<BR>
machine (Personal Workstation 500a aka &quot;Miata&quot;) and a
<BR>
test machine (AlphaServer 400 aka &quot;Avanti&quot;).  The
<BR>
Miata is running like gangbusters.  The Avanti keeps
<BR>
wigging out.  Both running RH6.0
<BR>
<P>I've had three different set of symptoms all leading
<BR>
to the same solution: re-install.  Here are the
<BR>
problems:
<BR>
<P>1) I deleted my app and found that two directories
<BR>
were totally wrong.  That is, the permissions looked
<BR>
something like &quot;?-rw-xrw-rwT&quot; and the file sizes were
<BR>
astronomical (like 4 terabytes).  I couldn't delete
<BR>
them or do anything to them.  I rebooted so I could do
<BR>
an fsck and found so many errors that it finally gave
<BR>
up.  Re-install.
<BR>
<P>2) I was running along and suddenly my app crashed. 
<BR>
Looking at /var/log/messages I saw there was a
<BR>
filesystem corruption message being posted there
<BR>
(unfortunately I forget the message).  Looking around
<BR>
the Internet I found some references to this message
<BR>
but no conclusive solutions.  I resolved to try a
<BR>
newer kernel. Rebooting to do an fsck ended the same
<BR>
as above: Too many errors, re-install.
<BR>
<P>When I compiled my own kernel (2.2.16), I wasn't able
<BR>
to get it to boot.  It's gets to &quot;OK, starting the
<BR>
kernel&quot; and then just stops.  Go back to 2.2.5 kernel
<BR>
from install.
<BR>
<P>3) Running along, app crashes.  Can't kill process. 
<BR>
Reboot.  fsck on bootup finds so many errors I give up
<BR>
and decide to reinstall.
<BR>
<P>Is this a known issue?  Is it my hardware?  Is it the
<BR>
kernel version?  If so, how to roll my own?
