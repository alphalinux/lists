<EM>&gt; Something that gives the option of direct I/O (no file
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system caching) like XFS would be very good to have.
</EM><BR>
<P>The cost of filesystem caching can be an extra copy. The Alpha has a rather
<BR>
great copy speed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'd hate to see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something like, for example, connecting a FCAL RAID system capable of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; over 100 MB/s transfer rate to my new Alpha Linux box and see no more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than 20-30 MB/s of effective throughput due to file system overhead.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have seen 50 MB/s to ext2 filesystems over a single FCAL link, for large
<BR>
writes. That's not as good as it should be, but one extra copy isn't the
<BR>
guilty party.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One thing I was looking at is GFS (Global File System), which offers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; direct concurrent access to the same file systems by multiple hosts.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This feature is highly desirable as well, but I have no information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on how efficient it is.  It also only works with certain hardware with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support for certain SCSI extensions.
</EM><BR>
<P>GFS can be installed a variety of ways; you don't have to have the special
<BR>
hardware.
<BR>
<P>We're using CVFS (CentraVision FileSystem) at FSL, but unfortunately they
<BR>
have yet to send us a full-speed client. On small SGIs, they get up to 170
<BR>
MB/s for a single client reading over 2 FCAL links. There's no reason why
<BR>
the AlphaLinux client should be any slower, but the work isn't done yet,
<BR>
alas.
