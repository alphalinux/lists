Hi Alex,
<BR>
<P>my recent experience with the 3c509b was that it just won't work on the
<BR>
alpha. i've got a up1000, and have tried both rh6.2 and SuSE6.3, different
<BR>
kernel modules and different card settings.
<BR>
i've also asked around on this and other lists for advice - i'll send you
<BR>
some of the answers i got.
<BR>
<P>it would be useful if it was documented somewhere that this driver/card
<BR>
doesn't work on the alpha - either in the rh/suse docs or the driver info.
<BR>
it would save people like ourselves wasting time trying to figure out
<BR>
what's wrong!
<BR>
<P>what i got was a situation where the module loaded ok, i could bring up
<BR>
the i/f and route but not traffic passed over the network.
<BR>
<P>if however you happen to get it working then please let me know how! 
<BR>
