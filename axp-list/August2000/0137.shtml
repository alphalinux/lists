<P>
If you have access to an NT cd, we have a freeware utility that will do just
<BR>
that (i386 or Alpha).
<BR>
It will allow you to create a CD-ROM with a program that will let you both
<BR>
backup/restore entire physical disks.  Make sure that the tape driver is
<BR>
placed on the CD too.
<BR>
<P>Goto:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.ultrabac.com/download/default.asp">http://www.ultrabac.com/download/default.asp</A>
<BR>
Select SADR (stand-alone disaster recovery)
<BR>
Select Alpha
<BR>
Select NT
<BR>
It is a 68KB download.  You'll need to run the MKDISKS.BAT file, and force
<BR>
the output to a directory on a disk.  Use this dir to burn a cd-rom (as the
<BR>
top level path \).

<EM>&gt; Hi folks!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I was wondering if there is something like a tool to produce bootable

<EM>&gt; backups under linux? I am refereng to something like ignite/UX from HP;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; build an image of the machine, wirte it to tape, boot from tape and either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just boot or rebuild the machine?

<P>I too would like the same thing.  That way, when a hard disk crashes, I can
<BR>
replace the hard disk, boot from tape, and have the system recreate itself.
<BR>
<P>Yes, I know, the traditional Linux approach to this problem is to boot from
<BR>
floppy, load a vanilla Linux from CD-ROM, and then restore a tar archive
<BR>
from
<BR>
tape.  Alternatively, the tape carries a dd archive.  In that case, I boot
<BR>
from
<BR>
floppy, and un-dd the tape onto disk.
<BR>
<P>The problem with the tar approach is that I have to re-partition the disk
<BR>
before I can de-tar.  I have to somehow remember the sizes of the
<BR>
partitions,
<BR>
or extract that information from the tar tape.
<BR>
<P>At a previous job in the Old Days, we used dd to 9-tracks to save and
<BR>
restore
<BR>
partitions on BSD systems on Vaxen.  There are several problems with the dd
<BR>
approach.  I have to replace the hard disk with a similar hard disk.  If I
<BR>
install, say, a larger hard disk onto the system, I'm not sure if the dd
<BR>
will
<BR>
work.  At the least, part of the new disk will be unuseable without
<BR>
re-partitioning.  And I'm very sure that if I install a smaller hard disk,
<BR>
whatever data was at the end of the last disk partition won't be restored,
<BR>
and
<BR>
the partition probably won't even fsck correctly.  Also, if there's an error
<BR>
on
<BR>
a dd tape, you potentially can lose much more than just a file, which is
<BR>
what
<BR>
you'll likely lose with an error on a tar tape.
<BR>
<P>Also, I'm less likely to mis-place the backup tapes than I am to mis-place
<BR>
the
<BR>
emergency boot floppy and Linux CD-ROM.  Why?  I make backups more
<BR>
frequently
<BR>
than I restore from floppy.  So I have handled the backup tapes more
<BR>
recently
<BR>
than the floppy.  So I'm more likely to know where the backup tapes are.  If
<BR>
I
<BR>
can reboot from those backup tapes, I save myself the step of having to
<BR>
search
<BR>
for the boot floppy and the Linux distribution CD-ROM.
<BR>
<P>I do know about having a spare root partition from which to boot.  We used
<BR>
the
<BR>
same trick on Vaxen, 15 years ago.  We referred to these as shadow roots.
<BR>
I'm
<BR>
reluctant to have to allocate space for, and maintain, a shadow root
<BR>
partition
<BR>
on each system I oversee.  It also means that I have to have a second disk
<BR>
drive on each system.
