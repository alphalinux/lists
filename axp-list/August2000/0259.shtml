You can set the jumpers in the Multia to a lower resolution so the
<BR>
TGA can sync with your monitor. Pull the board out and look to
<BR>
the lower right quadrant (under where the PCI card would be). The
<BR>
connectors on the board are to your right. You'll see 4 unmarked
<BR>
jumpers. Set the two left most jumpers and you'll boot in
<BR>
640x480 @ 60Hz. The lowest possible for the TGA. :-)
<BR>
<P>That should get you by...as for other options, I've tried these to
<BR>
good effect in the Multia:
<BR>
<P>#9 Motion 771 (S3 chipset)
<BR>
S3 Virge/GX
<BR>
Matrox Mystique
<BR>
<P>Note that you'll be blind in SRM though. You have to move the monitor
<BR>
over to TGA until everything is set up. Then just autoboot blind. 
<BR>
Works for me.

Subject: Re: Trio64 on Multia
<BR>
<P><P>Hello everyone,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a question that I cant seem to find the answer for anywhere...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried putting a Trio64 PCI graphics card in one of my Multia's, but I
<BR>
get a kernel panic when it tries to boot. Unhandled Exception if I
<BR>
remember correctly... When I pull out the Trio64, it boots just fine, and
<BR>
is quite happy... I would just leave it out, but I have an older monitor
<BR>
that cant sync to the signal of the TGA graphics adapter embedded in the
<BR>
Multia. I figured if I tossed in a PCI card, it would be a standard sync
<BR>
rate, and everything would work good...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got the Trio64 because I had seen some claims that it works generally
<BR>
fine on a Multia/UDB. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunantly my experiences are different.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does anyone know of a solution to this problem? 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I compile a new kernel without TGA support, would it fix the problem
<BR>
possibly?
<BR>
<P>Thanks in advance,
<BR>
