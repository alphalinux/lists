<EM>&gt; &gt; Absolutely on purpose; in order to prevent sneaking in a weird stuff

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yeah, but sneaking in weird stuff is so much fun.  I've had to change the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; source of several different packages to get them to compile.  I've always ended
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up re-tar.gz'ing (&lt;- now that is an interesting word) them and having to start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything over from scratch.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, no.  _That_ part you can short-circuit.  I have been through the
<BR>
process a few times myself so I know it pretty well.  :-)  Whatever you
<BR>
modify you add as a patch to your sources, or new/changed commands in
<BR>
specs, and you adjust your spec file as well so the next time when you
<BR>
will be building from zero your changes will be applied.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It would be nice to selectively move from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compiling, to installing,
</EM><BR>
<P>This is what '--short-circuit' flag is for.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and finally to wrapping a binary package one step at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a time.
</EM><BR>
<P>And this part is designed so anybody else can do 'rpm --rebuild ...'
<BR>
and this will really happen (at least in an environment similar enough).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What is with that 'rm -rf' thing anyway?
</EM><BR>
<P>An insurance that you are really doing what your spec file claims
<BR>
that you are doing.  This file is supposed to be a record of actual steps
<BR>
required to go from sources to working and installable binaries.
<BR>
Not everywhere you can do 'make distclean'.  OTOH there is really
<BR>
nothing which would _force_ you to use rpm.  But if you want to rely
<BR>
on rpm features then allowing &quot;quasi-rpms&quot;, or &quot;nearly-but-not-quite-rpms&quot;,
<BR>
would make all of this not worth to bother in a short time.
<BR>
<P>I realize that this is PITA on a slow machine and with a big package.
<BR>
That is why I suggested some hacks around that (as a temporary measure
<BR>
for a development work)  but they indeed do not allow to produce a
<BR>
binary package in one way and suggest at the same time that something
<BR>
else was done.
