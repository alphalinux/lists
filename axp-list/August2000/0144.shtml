<EM>&gt;It would be nice to see MILO expanded a bit and than used as the standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;loader for Alpha's. 
</EM><BR>
I would not like to see Milo used as the standard loader.  It makes little sense.  All current boxes are distributed with SRM.  Most older boxes were either distributed with SRM or now can have SRM.  Simply placing the appropriate bootloader in the proper place makes for a simpler boot (read less potential for problems).  
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Either that or there should be Linux support added to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ARC/Alphabios and posibly SRM. 
</EM><BR>
There is support in SRM. All you have to do is place the right bootloader for the appropriate O/S on the disk and Linux boots just fine.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Since the choices for OS on Alpha is either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;OSF/1-&gt;DigitalUnix-&gt;True64 or Linux. 
</EM><BR>
Nope. Many more:  OpenVMS (biggie), Tru64 (biggie), Linux (growing), *BSD, NT (shrinking)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;And with NT being no longer supported there seems little point in having an &gt;NT tailored boot loader.
</EM><BR>
Which means less and less developement for ARC/ARCbios/Alphabios thus very little incentive to continue to develop Milo whose primary purpose was to boot from these consoles.
<BR>
Whereas SRM will continue to get lots of developement because of OpenVMS and Tru64.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;P.S. I am sure that there ore other OS's that have Alpha support but for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the sake of simplicity I am only concerned with the 2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;supported(supposidly) by Compaq.
</EM><BR>
<P>O/S              Support                            Sanction 
<BR>
Tru64            Compaq                           yes
<BR>
OpenVMS     Compaq                           yes
<BR>
Linux             Distro/Community            yes
<BR>
*BSD             *BSD/Community             ?
<BR>
NT                 Community                       sortof/going away
<BR>
<P>I would not Classify Compaq as supporting Linux, you do not call them for Linux O/S support. Now if you mean which do they officially accept(sanction) you running on their hardware that's entirely different.  Compaq now supports the Linux Community, not you running the O/S.  This is new to Compaq, although not new to the old Digital side.
