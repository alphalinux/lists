<EM>&gt; &gt; That's a good question. After looking at the man page it appears that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; there no way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to get around that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Absolutely on purpose; in order to prevent sneaking in a weird stuff
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and manual interventions when making final archives.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, but sneaking in weird stuff is so much fun.  I've had to change the
<BR>
source of several different packages to get them to compile.  I've always ended
<BR>
up re-tar.gz'ing (&lt;- now that is an interesting word) them and having to start
<BR>
everything over from scratch.  It would be nice to selectively move from
<BR>
compiling, to installing, and finally to wrapping a binary package one step at
<BR>
a time.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; It is possible to create and use another spec file which will be doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mostly nothing until an installation phase.  Like one for Netscape from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DU. :-) Techically this will be a different rpm archive then the one you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tried to build in the first place.  Either redefine prep to do mostly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing or prepare &quot;sources&quot; from your current compilation tree.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Do not unpack on the top what you compiled or you will be starting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from scratch again.  The first action in a normal prep is 'rm -rf ...'.
</EM><BR>
<P>What is with that 'rm -rf' thing anyway?  I can understand the need to delete
<BR>
old binary trees, but why not do the same as the removing of the /var/tmp
<BR>
build roots.  Leave it as a command after the prep.  Basically without that you
<BR>
could simply comment out the 'rm -rf' and not have to rebuild all the object
<BR>
files.  Also, can I changed the default behavior of the %prep macro?
