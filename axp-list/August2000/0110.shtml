<P>
Folks,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know we've been moving all Red Hat lists that were on our old server
<BR>
running qmail and smartlist over to a new box running postfix and Mailman.  I
<BR>
won't go into the details of migration, but I wanted to give you some
<BR>
information about the new list.
<BR>
<P>(Note: In this message, LISTNAME refers to the list to which you are subscribed)
<BR>
<P>0)  All changes to your subscription can be performed by sending an email 
<BR>
message to LISTNAME-request@redhat.com.  For a help file on what commands are
<BR>
available, send a message to LISTNAME-request@redhat.com with the word &quot;help&quot;
<BR>
in the Subject line.
<BR>
<P>1)  All subscribers have a passwords associated with their subscription. You
<BR>
must use this password in order to alter the settings for how you receive
<BR>
email.  In order to obtain your password (and yes, you can change it), go to the
<BR>
URL for this list:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/LISTNAME/
<BR>
<P>and towards the bottom, enter your email address and click on &quot;Edit Options&quot;. 
<BR>
Then from the next page click on &quot;Email My Password To Me&quot;.
<BR>
<P>An ALTERNATIVE is to obtain your password via email by sending a message to
<BR>
LISTNAME-request@redhat.com with the word &quot;password&quot; in the subject line.
<BR>
<P>2)  You may choose to receive the postings in digest format (sent out daily). 
<BR>
Again you need to have the password as described in 1).
<BR>
<P>3)  Since the list gives each individual the option to receive in digest mode,
<BR>
the list &quot;LISTNAME-digest@redhat.com&quot; DOES NOT EXIST.  When we were running
<BR>
qmail and smartlist, for some email lists that had a digest option we had
<BR>
created the list LISTNAME-digest@redhat.com.  However, this is no longer 
<BR>
necessary.  If you were subscribed to LISTNAME-digest@redhat.com, we 
<BR>
subscribed you to the LISTNAME@redhat.com with the digest option selected.
<BR>
<P>4)  Archives of the list are also available online.  Sorry, they are not
<BR>
searchable.
<BR>
<P>Also, you've noticed that the headers are different.  If you are using filtering
<BR>
software, you may want to key off of &quot;X-BeenThere: redhat-list@redhat.com&quot;
<BR>
<P>PLEASE, if you have any questions or concerns or comments about the way the list
<BR>
is setup now, please do not create TFHes.  I know there are strong opinions from
<BR>
all camps about how to improve the way the lists are running.  And all comments
<BR>
are welcomed and appreciated.  But please keep the comments off of the list. 
<BR>
Feel free to email me directly or more appropriately 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mailto:LISTNAME-admin@redhat.com 
<BR>
<P>(if you click on the mailto link, be sure to change LISTNAME to the
<BR>
appropriate name)
<BR>
<P>Thanks for your patience,
<BR>
Kambiz
<BR>
