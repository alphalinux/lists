I had similar things happening on my AlphaStation 200 4/233 when I upgraded
<BR>
from the 5.3 firmware CD to the 5.5 firmware CD (ie. the normal looking boot
<BR>
letters at the top followed by spam and then an init, into an endless loop
<BR>
of this).  At the time, I only had 8MB of RAM.  It seems that the newer
<BR>
firmware needed more than 8MB of RAM, I added 16MB of RAM and I had SRM 5.5
<BR>
back again (though in the mean time, I had created a BIOS floppy and
<BR>
adjusted the jumper to read the SRM from that floppy and was able to reflash
<BR>
with 5.3).  (I was running Tru64 UNIX 4.0d at the time, and boy was it slow
<BR>
with 8MB of RAM.  It was swapping onto the disk so much that we started
<BR>
calling the box &quot;Thunder&quot; because of all of the noise the HD made.)
<BR>
<P>If you've got a decent amount of RAM installed, then the parity issue might
<BR>
be your problem.
<BR>
<P>I found the instructions for creating the SRM floppy on DEC's website and
<BR>
the jumper change in the owners manual.

someone else's AS200 - though it wasn't actually being used for

anything).  I suspected bad RAM, but this explanation makes sense too.
<BR>
<P>The problem is that SRM isn't usable because the machine crashes
<BR>
instantly when you power it on - how did you manage to turn off parity
<BR>
checking?
