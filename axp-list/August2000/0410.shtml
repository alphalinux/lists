<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; My money is still on the unresolved symbols in the network
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; drivers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If that would be the case then you would get loud complaints
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from a compiler and/or when loading network driver modules.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'insmod -v' is pretty specific about that.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's funny -- I remember insmod complaining, but loading the
<BR>
module anyway; but when I tried it just now, it worked without
<BR>
complaint.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &quot;Identical&quot; cards does not exclude hardware problems.  Broken
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; NICs happen from time to time.  Did you try to switch cards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; physically?
</EM><BR>
<P>Since my first message, yes, I have.  The problems remain on
<BR>
the same machine.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Is redhat 6.1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; somehow deficient in a way that slackware 7.0 isn't?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You mean that you have an Alpha kernel from Slackware which works
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and another one from Red Hat which does not?  Nothing really prevents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you from taking a kernel from one distribution and dropping it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with modules, into another one; or configuring and recompiling your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, the Slackware side is x86.  The alpha I'm connecting it to
<BR>
runs redhat 6.1.  I have compiled my own kernels on both sides.
<BR>
'depmod -e pci-scan' says that most unresolved symbols are pci-
<BR>
related.  I checked my kernel .config, and I enabled pci quirks,
<BR>
but not pci optimizations.  Relevant?  I don't know.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Most problems, when they show up, are actually platform independent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But I would be inclined to check first a configuration (like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DNS which points into a non-existing or non-reachable server,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or configured NIS when really there is not such thing).
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll explain more of the story -- these two machines have been
<BR>
hooked up with 10Mbps ethernet for months.  I bought a pair of
<BR>
10/100 NICs to increase the throughput.  The one in the PC works,
<BR>
but not the one in the alpha.  In fact, my current working setup
<BR>
is the old card in the alpha connected to the new one in the PC.
<BR>
<P>I think this would rule out configuration problems.  And I
<BR>
ruled out NIC hardware problems.  If it were a network client
<BR>
problem (ping, telnet), it should at least respond to pings,
<BR>
which it doesn't.  (Though TCP connections can be started but
<BR>
not established -- SYN_RECV/SYN_SENT on both ends.)  This would
<BR>
seem to me to narrow it down to a driver problem, though I could
<BR>
easily be forgetting something.  Though the same drivers work on
<BR>
the PC end.  The unresolved symbols in the drivers on the alpha
<BR>
are the only clue I have.
<BR>
<P>I'm a little out of my depth, so I do appreciate the help.
<BR>
