<EM>&gt; Hi Alex,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my recent experience with the 3c509b was that it just won't work on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alpha.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hm, this is from /var/log/dmesg on a real machine which is a &quot;workhorse&quot;
<BR>
for quite a few years now.
<BR>
<P>eth0: 3c509 at 0x300 tag 1, BNC port, address  00 a0 24 c3 e0 8f, IRQ 10.
<BR>
3c509.c:1.16 2/3/98 becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov
<BR>
<P>and this is what 'cat /proc/cpuinfo' has to say
<BR>
<P>cpu                     : Alpha
<BR>
cpu model               : EV4
<BR>
cpu variation           : 0
<BR>
cpu revision            : 0
<BR>
cpu serial number       : Linux_is_Great!
<BR>
system type             : EB64+
<BR>
system variation        : EB64+
<BR>
system revision         : 0
<BR>
system serial number    : MILO-0000
<BR>
....
<BR>
<P>so experimental data seems to be at odds with your claim; especially
<BR>
that the machine in question is on a network all the time.
<BR>
<P>In this particular case '3c509' support is compiled in as an integral
<BR>
kernel part.  There is also another card in this box - NE2000-PCI clone.
<BR>
This one is used as from time to time and its driver is loaded as
<BR>
a module.  It works as well.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; i've got a up1000, and have tried both rh6.2 and SuSE6.3,
</EM><BR>
<P>How about compiling your own kernel and paying attention how it is
<BR>
configured?  No, I did not try 3c509 on UP1000 and I do not know how
<BR>
is an ISA support on that hardware.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; it would be useful if it was documented somewhere that this driver/card
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't work on the alpha
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem is that it does.  Are you sure that your media were detected
<BR>
correctly?  I would be not surprised to find out that there are some
<BR>
problems there but this should be trivial to hack around in particular
<BR>
cases.
