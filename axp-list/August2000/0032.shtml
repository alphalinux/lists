<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The cost of filesystem caching can be an extra copy. The Alpha has a rather

</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I hope it's better than Sun/Solaris...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I have seen 50 MB/s to ext2 filesystems over a single FCAL link, for large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;writes. That's not as good as it should be, but one extra copy isn't the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;guilty party.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's pretty good.  Is this over the standard UFS on RH Linux?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;GFS can be installed a variety of ways; you don't have to have the special
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hardware.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wonder how its performance is when it's running in a multi-access
<BR>
environment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;We're using CVFS (CentraVision FileSystem) at FSL, but unfortunately they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have yet to send us a full-speed client. On small SGIs, they get up to 170
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;MB/s for a single client reading over 2 FCAL links. There's no reason why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the AlphaLinux client should be any slower, but the work isn't done yet,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;alas.
</EM><BR>
<P>Is this also a multiple access file system?  Who makes it, and how is
<BR>
its performance?
<BR>
<P>thanks for your reply,
