<EM>&gt; &gt; Hmmmm. I have  a UP2000 here at my disposal. I'll see what I can do.

<EM>&gt; Some people get all the cool machines . . .
</EM><BR>
<P>Heh, I wish it was mine. I'm at work. Honestly what I'd love to have at
<BR>
home
<BR>
is a UP1100.

<EM>&gt; On building RPMs, every now and then the compiler will die during a build.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can always rpm -bc --short-circuit to finish the compile, but there is no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; short-circuit of rpm -bb.  If the package is already compiled, is there any way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to jump past the prep, compile, and install stages straight to building a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; binary?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>That's a good question. After looking at the man page it appears that
<BR>
there no way
<BR>
to get around that. I would suck having to rebuild all those object
<BR>
files. Might
<BR>
we benfit by hacking the rpm source? :-)
