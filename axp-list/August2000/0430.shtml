<P>
<EM>&gt; Yeah, but sneaking in weird stuff is so much fun.  I've had to change the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; source of several different packages to get them to compile.  I've always ended
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up re-tar.gz'ing (&lt;- now that is an interesting word) them and having to start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything over from scratch.  It would be nice to selectively move from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compiling, to installing, and finally to wrapping a binary package one step at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a time.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes. This would be a vaulable extention indeed. Especially when you're
<BR>
packaging
<BR>
something that takes a long time to compile like for example gcc. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It is possible to create and use another spec file which will be doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; mostly nothing until an installation phase.  Like one for Netscape from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; DU. :-) Techically this will be a different rpm archive then the one you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; tried to build in the first place.  Either redefine prep to do mostly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; nothing or prepare &quot;sources&quot; from your current compilation tree.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Do not unpack on the top what you compiled or you will be starting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; from scratch again.  The first action in a normal prep is 'rm -rf ...'.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's one way of doing it though I would like to keep things as simple
<BR>
as possible. Having a couple differnet versions of spec files that have
<BR>
different purposes is kind of a pain. 
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; What is with that 'rm -rf' thing anyway?  I can understand the need to delete
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; old binary trees, but why not do the same as the removing of the /var/tmp
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; build roots.  Leave it as a command after the prep.  Basically without that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could simply comment out the 'rm -rf' and not have to rebuild all the object
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; files.  Also, can I changed the default behavior of the %prep macro?
</EM><BR>
<P>Indeed. Passing a command flag that will change the default behavior of
<BR>
%prep
<BR>
would be ideal. That or you 'could' define your own macro to use instead
<BR>
of %prep
<BR>
that allowed such things in /usr/lib/rpm/macros.
