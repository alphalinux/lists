<P>i've turned the autodetect off and set it to 10mb tp. i've not tried bnc,

though i can't see how that would make a difference (if i had the cables

here i'd try it)

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; furthermore, i've got the same card working fine on a pc, with the same

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As I recall if you are configuring one of these cards it might be useful to

<EM>&gt; stick it in a X86 PC, and using a DOS boot disk run the configuration

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is not particularly good at PnP..
</EM><BR>
<P>yeah, this is what i've heard. but i've turned pnp off, using the 3Com dos
<BR>
utility (which i also used to set the media type).
<BR>
<P>(and no, as i remember there were no compiler errors/warnings)
<BR>
<P>i don't mean to sound pessimistic, but i've sort of tried every
<BR>
combination of kernel/module/driver/card configs i can think of, so maybe
<BR>
it's a hw specific thing with the up1000?

<P>&nbsp;though as Roberto recently said -&gt;

<BR>
<P>I have seen the very same problem on both an Alpastation
<BR>
275 and 500. There seems to be no workaround. I went as
<BR>
far as to try FreeBSD/AXP, with no results . 
<BR>
&lt;/snip&gt;
<BR>
<P>i've thought of contacting the driver author/maintainer to see if they are
<BR>
aware of any problems with the alpha, though not had time yet (and they're
<BR>
probably busy..)
<BR>
in any case, i'll probably just ditch the 509 and get a decent card.. :&gt;
