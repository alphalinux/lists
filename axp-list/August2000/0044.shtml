<EM>&gt;If you are not using &quot;UFS&quot; as a generic term then UFS on Linux is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;standard; just an add-on for special needs and used very infrequently.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A prevalent file system type on Linux is ext2 but other start to gain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;popularity.  In particular Reiser fs and ext3.  This is only a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;clarification.

<P><EM>&gt;That's over the Linux filesystem called &quot;ext2&quot;. Linux also supports the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;filesystem named UFS, but it isn't the standard one that people use.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm showing my ignorance of Linux.  There must be online docs that I
<BR>
can read about these?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Is this also a multiple access file system?  Who makes it, and how is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;its performance?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It is made by MountainGate, which is now owned by ADIC. For info, see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;www.centravision.com. It is multiple access, by heterogeneous clients (SGI,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Mac, NT, Linux now; Solaris soon, AIX later.) It's also much more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expensive -- around $2000 for a single CPU client -- than GFS (GPLed).

<P>Free (or really cheap) is the bassis of Beowulf systems, and it's
<BR>
definitely my preference, unless there is something significant to
<BR>
be gained by paying such significant prices.
