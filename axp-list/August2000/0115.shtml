OK, I think I have a picture.  Thanks to the following for their

<P>The maximum memory size that Lunix kernel 2.2.x can recognize is 2 GB.
<BR>
With application of the bigmem patch, the kernel can use an unlimited
<BR>
amount of memory.  This feature is already in kernel 2.4.x.  There are
<BR>
a couple of repositories of patches at:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/">http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/</A>
<BR>
and/or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/">http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/</A>
<BR>
<P>which must contain the bigmem patches.
<BR>
<P>My second question concerned swapping or thrashing when an application
<BR>
starts to use up all the physical memory in the system, and still needs
<BR>
to do disk I/O.  With the file system cache that ordinarily takes up
<BR>
whatever unused memory there is in the system, the performance of such
<BR>
a program can become unpredictable as it fights with the UBC for memory
<BR>
(or rather, when it needs memory, and cached data must be flushed).
<BR>
The mlock function seems like a good way to make sure that the
<BR>
application has all the memory it needs, just as long as it does not
<BR>
attempt to lock down so much memory that the rest of the system can no
<BR>
longer do anything.
<BR>
<P>The other possibility is to mmap the files and use the VM management
<BR>
features of the operating system (and maybe hardware) to access the
<BR>
files as arrays within the program.  There are two problems with this.
<BR>
First, if the system is memory bound already, there is precious little
<BR>
memory remaining to let the OS do its thing.  Second, the VM system
<BR>
usually has no idea how you want to access your data, so it can not
<BR>
optimally swap the pieces of the data for you.  (Exactly like caching;
<BR>
the CPU caches only work with prescribed algorithms, and if the way
<BR>
your program accesses data is not consistent with the way the CPU cache
<BR>
works, your data access speed will be down to memory speed.)  Many
<BR>
papers have been written on this subject, including how to provide
<BR>
hints to the VM using the madvise function.
<BR>
<P>To alleviate the problem of insufficient physical memory, we are
<BR>
attempting to do our own memory management using large files.  Since we
<BR>
know exactly how our program uses its data, we can use separate threads
<BR>
to perform write-behinds or read-aheads to keep data not currently used
<BR>
on disk.  But the bugger here is that file I/O uses file system cache,
<BR>
and CPU cycles to copy between user space and file system cache.  So,
<BR>
we're looking into using raw partitions as our disk buffers.  At least
<BR>
on Solaris, I/O to raw disk partitions seems to require no system
<BR>
buffering whatsoever, so no memory is being used, and no CPU cycles are
<BR>
wasted in copying between user space and system cache.
<BR>
<P>thanks again for all the inputs, and further comments are welcome.
