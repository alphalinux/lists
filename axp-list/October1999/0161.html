Hi Kirk,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen the writing  on the wall and it says &quot;Telecom&quot;.  I moved to
<BR>
a little company in the guts of the telecommunications protocol business
<BR>
called Adax Inc (Berkeley California, where I live)   I moved them to
<BR>
StrongArm
<BR>
while I was in the OEM Division and they decided I knew something.  I saw an
<BR>
opportunity to learn the structure of the backbone of international
<BR>
telecommunications.
<BR>
I began last Monday. (and went for discussions at the worlds largest telecom
<BR>
equipment manufacturer on Tuesday)   My book is still open because of some
<BR>
issues which one often encounters in intimate little companies, but,
<BR>
with a degree in Mathematics, I like the protocol business (Frame relay,
<BR>
ATM, GSM, 3G, ...).   The future for telecom is fascinating.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company we supported with their OpenBoot environment is Network
<BR>
Appliance
<BR>
a group of Sun expatriates, and very capable ones.  They developed their own
<BR>
kernel for their Alpha platforms.  I did my best to encourage Digital, then
<BR>
Compaq
<BR>
to acquire NetApp.  Dell now re-sells Alpha-based Netapp servers.  Netapp
<BR>
developers (core developers of NSF) really wring the performance from.
<BR>
Alpha processors..  Network Appliance has not only shown that it is possible
<BR>
to make lots of money being on the &quot;bleeding edge&quot;, but that it is also
<BR>
possible
<BR>
to build robust platforms.  Netapp filers back up companies like Yahoo and
<BR>
Amazon.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company  formed by the OpenBoot developers (out of Sun) is called
<BR>
&quot;Firmworks&quot; , www.firmworks.com .  I suspect Firmworks has rights to the
<BR>
original Alpha port, though the guy who did it moved to Network Appliance
<BR>
during the process.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please don't put Network Appliance name on the &quot;mailing list&quot;, just out
<BR>
of consideration.  They have no interest in publicly supporting OpenBoot,
<BR>
but Firmworks is fair game.  I am on good terms with Compaq (I think)
<BR>
so anyone could contact me.  Aaron Bauch is till with Compaq, though
<BR>
in a different group, and was the liaison to &quot;Hudson&quot; during the porting
<BR>
effort.  Ed Freedman ran (may still run), the group which produces the
<BR>
EBSDK (Eval Board Software Dev Kit).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The product Netapp used for their first Alpha platform was
<BR>
developed by my group, the OEM division, and was a 14 slot &quot;PICMG&quot;
<BR>
platform with a 500 MHz 164 processor.  Netapp fortunately choose
<BR>
to develop their own 264 boards, much as I tried to drag our group
<BR>
into the &quot;real world&quot;. and have us build the board Netapp wanted.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our division was sold to Smart Modular Computers
<BR>
in July, which was in-turn bought by Solectron about 3 weeks ago. I
<BR>
choose to bail even though Smart Modular is in my neighborhood.
<BR>
I didn't have confidence that Smart Modular could be successful
<BR>
in the CompactPCI business.  In retrospect I could have made
<BR>
a little pile when the Smart Modular stock jumped before the
<BR>
purchase.by Solectron (which also just bought Force).
<BR>
&nbsp;Ironically, I am now surrounded by CompactPCI development
<BR>
as the telecom industry moves to CompactPCI
<BR>
en-mass.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is your involvement with Alpha?
<BR>

<P><P><EM>&gt; Mike,

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm glad you came forward with this.  I'll remind API and Compaq of this,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just in case they have forgotten (or worse, were never privy to this
</EM><BR>
info).
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hope you are happy at your new haunts, mind if I ask where you went?
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt; &gt;Your point is a good one Kirk.  Since I am no longer with Q I can say
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;one of our largest OEM customers did the work to port OpenBoot to their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Alpha platforms.  They even offered us the use of their OpenBoot code
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;(but of course they wouldn't have supported it).   We also looked several
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;times at using it on some internal development.  The decision was finally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to stick with SRM because of the PAL implications (and because it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;was done and could be easily modified for our R&amp;D).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    If there is interest, the company founded by the creators of OpenBoot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;(which name escapes me at the moment), probably has rights to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;port done by this Silicon Valley file server company, (one of whose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;principle developers moved to the file serve company), and could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;provide OpenBoot very easily, and supply the support (that is their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;business).  I won't put the names on line, but would put an individual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;on the right track .  This would appear to be an OpenBoot opportunity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to  expand their (yes, there is a profit incentive) market.  In
</EM><BR>
retrospect,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;It would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;probably have been to Digital's advantage to use OpenBoot from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the beginning, though I doubt Microsoft could have been convinced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to use it.
