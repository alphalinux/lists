<P>
I've spent some time this week taking an old Multia, connecting and
<BR>
external SCSI drive to it, and getting RedHat 6.0 up on it. I'm really
<BR>
quite pleased with it overall. It's not a screamer, but does nicely
<BR>
nevertheless. It'll do as low-volume web server. 
<BR>
<P>Currently, to get the machine up I let it boot to SRM, then I boot off
<BR>
of the floppy (dva0) that has a milo.dd image on it. From milo I boot
<BR>
off of a kernel on sda1 (later mounted as /boot). 
<BR>
<P>I'm wondering, how can I get this machine to boot by itself (like my
<BR>
Intel-based Linux boxes do). After doing as much reading as I can, I'm
<BR>
quite confused. (I do that easily sometimes.) 
<BR>
<P>Thanks for your patience. I'm new to Alphas, but having fun
<BR>
nevertheless. 
<BR>
