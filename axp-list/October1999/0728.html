I had some issues with 3Com 3C905b on both x86 and Alpha, so I searched
<BR>
<A HREF="http://support.redhat.com">http://support.redhat.com</A> (knowledge base) you'll see that there are some
<BR>
issues with this card.  Even thought it's in the kernel it bahves strangely
<BR>
and you need to try different PCI slots.
<BR>
<P>A real easy way to test it (I'll probably get slammed for this) is to use
<BR>
linuxconf and add it as a second ethernet card.  Configure the appropriate
<BR>
IP address etc.. When you reboot see if &quot;eth1&quot; comes up.  If so, log in as
<BR>
root and ping the IP you assigned to this card.  If it works, the card is
<BR>
successfully installed on the local machine.   Next, go to another machine
<BR>
and ping the same address.
<BR>
<P>Today there was a guy at work who tried installing Red Hat 6.0 with a 3c905b
<BR>
card and had an incident where it didn't work under 6.0, so he re-installed
<BR>
5.2 and it detects the card fine.  I strongly suggest you try my above
<BR>
method for a basic, no-brainer approach.  Red the support.redhat.com pages
<BR>
on 3c905b.

<P><P><EM>&gt; Howdy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is probably a really basic question but I haven't been able to find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the answer anywhere.  How do you know if a network card is recognized by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the system (XL266)????  I have an a digital 21040 tulip card and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to put in another card: I have a 3c590, and 3c905b either one will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do. From what I can tell my kernel has been compiled with 3COM support.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The digital card was recognized when I installed RH5.2 with no problems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is there any other configuration that must be done to get a card to run at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 100base tx????
