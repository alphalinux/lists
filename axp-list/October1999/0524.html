<EM>&gt; Have you run the DMAconf.exe utility for the ARC console?  Its available

<P>I would, only I'm using SRM, not ARC.

<P>What I can't yet figure out is why kernel 2.2.9 is unique in that sound is
<BR>
much more stable with my setup than any other kernel.  It still hangs at
<BR>
random with sound, but not NEARLY as much as any other kernels I've tried.
<BR>
Is anyone else on the list booting from SRM and successfully using an ISA
<BR>
sound card?  Would the kernel care whether or not an ISA card was configured
<BR>
with isacfg in SRM?  I would think not, since my soundcard does work, when
<BR>
the driver doesn't freeze the whole system.  :)
<BR>
<P>Help!
