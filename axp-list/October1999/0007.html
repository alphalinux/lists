<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over one year has passed since the dream of an Alpha Linux
<BR>
Organization became a reality.  In that time, our membership has
<BR>
grown and we have received donations of web space, money, and hardware 
<BR>
from diverse sources.  The dedication of selfless coders has propelled 
<BR>
Linux to the forefront of the public stage, pulling the Alpha architecture
<BR>
and our group with it.  To the community from which ALO was born, thank 
<BR>
you for giving wings to the dreams of our ragtag band. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an exciting time for ALO, and we are in the process of
<BR>
laying plans for future directions.  Your thoughts and opinions on 
<BR>
our 'performance' this past year are valuable and desired.  
<BR>
What did you like or not like? What should we be doing that we're not? 
<BR>
All of us are busy with work or school, and it would be nice to know 
<BR>
whether the time we spend is in the best interests of the AlphaLinux 
<BR>
community. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feel free to contact me directly at dfrasnel@alphalinux.org, or
<BR>
send something to our administrative mailing list at admin@alphalinux.org.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
Thanks, and looking forward to your input.
<BR>
