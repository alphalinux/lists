<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I am still suspicious of the Adaptec.

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Can you borrow a Symbios Logic based card, such as an Intraserver to test

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; it with?

<EM>&gt; &gt; Well, my 164LX still hangs sporadicly, though I'm not sure it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; related to the above problem.  My machine doesn't hang on boot, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; randomly under load. I have *no* further ideas about how to fix or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; debug the problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;My hang (I have the Adaptec card) is during operation, generally under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some sort of load. Once it hangs, though, a soft reboot (by Alt-SysRq-b)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;leads to MILO hanging. Hence my question about interrupts. The 2.2.12 may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;well be related, though I'm having a little trouble understanding how that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;might cause the trouble with the MILO soft reboot.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt;It is interesting that Greg is having similar symptoms with a largely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;different system from mine.
</EM><BR>
<P>Indeed this is interesting. I know it is NOT the LX design as we have many 
<BR>
customers with very long uptimes on LX.
<BR>
I think I agree with the suggestions to try some different memory, if possible.
<BR>
Generally look in any machine check errors for lines mentioning &quot;630&quot; or 
<BR>
especially&quot;670&quot; which are often memory errors.
<BR>
<P>Also, do you access to a digital thermometer with a probe? If so maybe ( 
<BR>
with the case closed and the system running for at least an hour) check 
<BR>
temperature of air coming off the CPU, and at the memory modules. I have 
<BR>
seen instances of the  memory overheating, especially on larger ( 256MB) 
<BR>
modules when fully populated.
<BR>
<P>Power is also a possibility, although usually this show up on other things, 
<BR>
like, for instance, the monitor display being &quot;wavy&quot;.
