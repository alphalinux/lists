<P>
<EM>&gt; 	The question I was getting at in the last post was not really 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Should we build a better distro because none are perfect?&quot;, but rather 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an underlying theme that accompanies it: self-sustainment vs. adaptation.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Should AlphaLinux focus on very specific niches where it historically fits 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in well, or continue in an attempt to be 'all things to all users', 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; covering every market that Linux/x86 targets?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't really understand the question. I picked RedHat because I
<BR>
wanted the same distribution for Intel and Alpha machines, and at the
<BR>
time, RedHat was the only one. I don't think RH puts much effort into
<BR>
getting tetex and ghostview to compile, so the cost of going from a
<BR>
working server distribution to a full client distribution is probably
<BR>
pretty small. Given the general distribution, I do the work required
<BR>
to get things working in my niche. That's my focus. No one else really
<BR>
shares it (I have very particular ideas about how things should work),
<BR>
nor do I expect them to.
<BR>
<P>I don't need sound drivers. I don't care about sound drivers. I expect
<BR>
that the people who care about them will do that work, and if they do
<BR>
it, we should all help make sure it gets into the overall kernel and
<BR>
distributions.
<BR>
<P>So, in short, I don't see how &quot;we&quot; are going to focus on anything.
<BR>
We're an anarchy, just like the rest of Linux.
