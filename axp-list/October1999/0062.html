<EM>&gt; crunching, like weather forcasting supercomputers.&quot; (I'm so subtle,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aren't I?) Attacking the desktop and small server market depends on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; low price machines, and that's out of our hands. Only API and Compaq
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can make those happen. The software is already mostly ready.

<P>I'd agtee with this.  If you say Linux of any flavor is &quot;ready&quot; for the
<BR>
desktop, you'd pretty much have to put the status of the Alpha port on 
<BR>
the same field.  The only thing I'd consider REALLY lacking is games, which
<BR>
isn't really a big factor for me as I do most of my game playing on inexpensive
<BR>
consoles.  Office stuff?  No Star Office on Alpha (yet), but we have Applix, in
<BR>
addition to whatever progress has been made on the free applications.
<BR>
The browser problem is somewhat of an issue, as you can't run Netscape on Alpha
<BR>
Linux without ex$pensive Tru64 libraries.  This is also out of our hands and up
<BR>
to Compaq and Netscape, at least until Mozilla develops to a point where it
<BR>
*can* replace Netscape for all uses, and not just casual browsing.  ICQ clients
<BR>
are also a weak area of the Alpha, as pretty much the best Linux ICQ client
<BR>
(licq) simply doesn't run on the Alpha.  Any recommendations here for a
<BR>
GUI-based client that's relatively stable on Alphas?  I'm using nicq as a
<BR>
graphical client at the moment.  Not a pinnacle of stability, but at least it
<BR>
can talk to the network.
<BR>
<P>Heck, my Alpha systems *are* used as desktop systems (one doubles as a
<BR>
low-volume web/ftp server).  If Compaq got the price down to reasonable levels
<BR>
for home users, I might buy more. :)
