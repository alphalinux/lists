<P>
Thank you for all the help with my DS20 clone.  It has been up and stable
<BR>
now for almost a week, under relatively heavy load, and maybe all the
<BR>
serious bugs have been wrung out of it.
<BR>
<P>To return something to this list before I unsubscribe and peruse it on
<BR>
the archive sites, I'd like to add what I learned about how to install
<BR>
RH 6.0 on this machine (much of which is in the documentation, but some
<BR>
of which contradicts the documentation):
<BR>
<P>0.  Use the on-board SCSI Adaptec controllers for the install, rather than
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the NCR contollers; the kernels/generic.gz kernel on the RH 6.0 CD
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has timing problems with the NCR controllers I have.
<BR>
1.  Use fdisk to partition the disk.
<BR>
2.  Use a bsd disk label (&quot;b&quot; in fdisk).
<BR>
3.  Leave the first cylinder free for the boot block.
<BR>
4.  Do not allocate more cylinders to the last partition than are really
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the disk, even if fdisk suggests you do.
<BR>
5.  Do not allocate partition c to the whole disk (even though it says to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do so in the RH documentation, it wouldn't work like this).
<BR>
6.  Remember, after installing the RPMs, to write the booter to the boot block.
<BR>
7.  Install more recent binutils than are on the RH 6.0 CD, especially if
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you use -mieee and the gcc-2.95.1 compiler.  (gcc-2.95 has a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;code generation bug for IEEE floating-point code with -mcpu=ev6.)  I
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suggest the 2.9.5.0.* series maintained by H. J. Lu at
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="ftp://ftp.varesearch.com/pub/support/hjl">ftp://ftp.varesearch.com/pub/support/hjl</A>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(although there are still some 64bit bugs in the latest code that should
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be fixed in 2.9.5.0.17 when that comes out)
<BR>
7.  Install a relatively recent kernel (I couldn't get the kernels before
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2.13 to work reliably, specifically, I had problems with 2.2.5 shipped on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the RH CD, 2.2.11, and 2.2.12). (Other people suggest using a relatively
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;old 2.2 kernel; YMMV.)
<BR>
8.  Install all RH updated RPMs (although the kde updates won't install
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of a missing library, but I don't use kde on that machine).
<BR>
9.  Before running out of real memory and having to use virtual memory,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;switch from the Adaptec controllers to the NCR contollers so you don't
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trash your hard disk.
<BR>
<P>Ugh.  It is relatively painful to recall what has been needed so far to
<BR>
get this machine working correctly.  But the fdisk suggestion seems to have
<BR>
fixed the last big problem.
