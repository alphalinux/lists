<P>
This level of detail typically only comes, directly or indirectly, from
<BR>
non-disclosure presentations,
<BR>
so called because those receiving the information sign a legal agreement
<BR>
promising not to 
<BR>
disclose it.  The indirect sources are the rags like The Register who troll
<BR>
for tidbits leaked to
<BR>
them and then invent enough stuff of their own to fill in what's missing.
<BR>
<P>The problem is that there's never any way to tell what the quality of the
<BR>
information is.  The 
<BR>
person you're listening to might have heard it directly from the source last
<BR>
week, or they
<BR>
might have heard it from someone who heard it from someone who heard it from
<BR>
someone...
<BR>
It's easy to find instances of information that's been distorted beyond
<BR>
recognition by this
<BR>
game of &quot;telephone&quot; or which, while accurate at one point, has since been
<BR>
out dated by
<BR>
changing plans.
<BR>
<P>Of course, those who are really &quot;in the know&quot; don't talk in public because
<BR>
they
<BR>
know that when the next round of proprietary information is distributed,
<BR>
those who didn't
<BR>
respect their agreements for the last round won't be included.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>P.S. SPEC also has some very specific rules for product availability, etc,
<BR>
which are to
<BR>
be followed when publishing results using their benchmarks (whether or not
<BR>
they are
<BR>
listed on the SPEC web site).  It would be interesting to know whether he
<BR>
followed those
<BR>
rules for the results he quotes.
