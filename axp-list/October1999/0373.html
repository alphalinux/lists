Greetings ...
<BR>
<P>Yes, I can confirm that there are PC164 systems  that just will not work
<BR>
with SCSI at all.
<BR>
I own such a system.  I tried Adaptec, Symbios Logic, IntraServer and a few
<BR>
more adapters
<BR>
that I can't remember.  Non of them worked.  I bought new memory, but that
<BR>
did no good 
<BR>
either.  All would boot up just fine, but would eventually hang. Often with
<BR>
absolutely no
<BR>
error message.  And I mean &quot;hang&quot;, it would take a hard reset (power off /
<BR>
power on) to
<BR>
regain control.  I spent months screwing around with SCSI cables,
<BR>
termination and everything
<BR>
else I could think of.  I eventually got tired of the &quot;bull shit&quot; and used
<BR>
IDE drives.  They work
<BR>
OK, but &quot;they ain't  SCSI&quot;.  Everything new I do now is on Intel based
<BR>
hardware.  Intel
<BR>
may not be as elegant as Alpha, but Intel just seems to work and is one
<BR>
hell of a lot
<BR>
cheaper.  And *MUCH* less aggravating.  I don't buy hardware to spend all
<BR>
my free time
<BR>
trying to make it work!
<BR>
<P>No &quot;flames&quot; about Alpha vs. Intel are necessary from Alpha &quot;bigots&quot;.  This
<BR>
is America, you
<BR>
can buy and use any hardware you want.  I really don't care what you think
<BR>
is &quot;better&quot;,
<BR>
whatever that means.

<EM>&gt;&gt; I think I agree with the suggestions to try some different memory, if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; possible. Generally look in any machine check errors for lines
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; mentioning &quot;630&quot; or  especially&quot;670&quot; which are often memory errors. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This damn PC164 system board takes expensive SIMMS, and takes them in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;large banks, so trying different memory is not convenient. However, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;memory is relatively recent, and I had similar problems even before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;changing it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Where would I find machine check errors? none seem to find their way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;into any logs I have.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I also had a hang up just now, with the 2.2.12 memory leak patch applied.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It is true, though, that I've been running memory-intensive programs,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;namely egcs-c++ on some bison generated C++ files. (These tend to generate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lots of disk activity too.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*sigh* I'd be ready to blame the Adaptec board, but at least one other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;person on this list has reported similar problems with a non-adaptec
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(QLog, I think) SCSI card. And I've heard that the 2940UW is reasonably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;well supported in Linux.
