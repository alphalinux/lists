On the topic of UPS's:  Not to say that your problem is the incoming power,  but most people I have ran into do not understand that most UPS do not condition the power.  Backup UPS do not condition the power when drawing from the utility.  Only when you are on battery do you get a cleaned power.  Some of them boost the power when there is a sag (brown out) but it is not conditioned.  Only true on-line UPS condition the power that is only because of the nature of their design.  If you have the equipment and know what you are doing(!) you can check the quality of your power.
<BR>
<P>You said the machine that is your example is on a on-line UPS so the quality of the power coming out of it should be good.  However,  there is also the condition in which the equipment you have plugged in could be causing the power to become dirty, unless you have isolation.
<BR>
<P>Calvin.

<EM>&gt; &gt; The machines are from DCG.  They say it's:

<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Axxion DL-17 Midtower Case w/Extra Cooling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Fan and 300W Power Supply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Should be fine, no?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's interesting. I have a PC164 with what looks like the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same case. It too occasionally would just stop and nothing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would respond. It wasn't very often though, less than once 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a month. It's powered off at the moment since I have UPS power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constraints. I looked at the 164LX user manual and it says 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you need: +3.3v/5,0A, +5v/14A, -5v/0A, +12v/1A, -12v/.1A, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 100W power dissipation for a 600MHZ board, without any other stuff. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I bought my 164LX from Microway and it is in a full tower case.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If I have time today, I'll pop the covers and compare the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power supply ratings, assuming they have stickers on them.

<P>The bigger problem I have is that it seems to be an intermittent
<BR>
problem.  My uptime at the moment it 6 days.  So far it seems to be
<BR>
fine.  It seems like hangs are sort of clustered, i.e. I get several,
<BR>
then none for a while.  I guess I could try building a modular kernel
<BR>
again and see if it's still reproducible.  The only thing is that I'm
<BR>
tired of rebooting my machine.  I guess I'll try a modular kernel
<BR>
tomorrow.
<BR>
<P>Maybe I'll check the output of the PS for good measure.
