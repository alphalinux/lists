<P>
<EM>&gt; Besides, what is it with this $80 price tag?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MSRP
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I picked up a Cheap Byte's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CD at a computer show for $5. 
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's nice - but I thought we were talking about Red Hat's 6.1
<BR>
retail package.  You can get dists from LinuxMall for $1.98 - but you get
<BR>
what you pay for... the CD.  Like I said, the $80 for the retail package of
<BR>
RH gets you a whole lot more than a CD and a book.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RH is well aware of the &quot;caliber&quot; of the user in the Alpha
<BR>
community, and there are those that will likely never do more than download
<BR>
the ISO and burn a CD, but there are plenty of sys admins out the who _will_
<BR>
buy the retail package (or have it bought &amp; thrust upon them) - particularly
<BR>
given the insurgence of the low profile rack servers and the idea of
<BR>
&quot;Internet appliances&quot; - the Compaq DS10L will be one such machine, and you
<BR>
can be sure that lots of them will ship with RH installed.  The DS20 is
<BR>
another prime target given that NT will die on it in a few months time.....
<BR>
Red Hat is predicting (banking on, really) that 25 million servers will ship
<BR>
with Linux installed in the next 2 years.  That's servers, in the
<BR>
enterprise, not solely IA boxes for netsurfers and MP3 downloaders...  We
<BR>
happen to believe them to be correct - we get more calls every day looking
<BR>
for Linux.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It might be wise for an absolute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beginner to Linux to purchase the box set the first time. But most of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; us can do without the full-blown version.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interesting comment - I've been using Linux on IA since late 95  -
<BR>
but this DS20 was my first Alpha load.  I felt like a total newbie on the
<BR>
install.....  Had I spent $80 on the current 6.0 package from RH (I got it
<BR>
free) I would likely be a bit miffed given it's lack of content (and that
<BR>
includes functional software).  But I still get a month of free phone
<BR>
support and all that jazz.  Even if I never crack the manual I've likely
<BR>
gotten my money's worth - I've been shipped documents from  and made
<BR>
contacts inside Red Hat that I will likely use over again - is that worth it
<BR>
to everyone? I guess maybe not, but it certainly is in my line of work....
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be interesting to see what the 6.1 release will hold,
<BR>
particularly since RH (finally) just got a stable of Alpha gear from Compaq
<BR>
a week or two ago...... I've told both Compaq and Red Hat that they have
<BR>
some pretty big strides to make before the &quot;Alpha pieces&quot; meet the &quot;IA
<BR>
pieces&quot;....  Being Compaq's single largest Alpha reseller I'd like to think
<BR>
what we say holds some merit, but then who can tell.....

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Maybe because there is a difference between &quot;it builds&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and &quot;it works&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;We have seen something along these lines with 6.0. :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; And 5.0 and 4.0 etc. My advice - just wait a few months. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 6.1 will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; released and the updates dir for it will be chock full of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fixes. But for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; gods sake, don't buy it. 
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; That's a bad advise not to buy.  If I were RedHat, I'd drop Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; support just for the spite, given such attitude.  RedHat is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; commercial venture, not a bunch of programmers for charity.  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; they don't make money, we all lose.

<EM>&gt; 	Funny - folks will buy a $145.00 text book for 1 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; semester, but won't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spend $80 for a few CD's and manuals that will come in handy 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for a long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time.  I for one look forward to seeing what RH does with the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; docs - the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stuff with 6.0 (IA) was OK, but the Alpha piece was certainly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slender. OTOH
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - I pick up a trick or two every time I blow through the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; admin guide for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	Aside from all that - purchase of the 6.1 release 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; includes 30 days
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of phone support, 90 days of email support, 180 days of &quot;high 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; priority&quot; FTP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; access, and over 900 pages of docs....  Not bad for $80.00......
