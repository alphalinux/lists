<P>
Paul,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;And I wasn't even invited to the binge!  Hurmpphh!  ;-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Next time your in Portland OR, give me a ring! There are even a few decent
<BR>
Brit pubs around here (if you don't want to do a true German Oktoberfest).
<BR>
You can take the MAX lightrail around here to get home safely (as long as
<BR>
you can still see the train coming that is). 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Agreed -- on a bus with a single drive, your points are well founded, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this is similar to the wretched SCSI vs Ultra IDE debate we both survived on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the AlphaNT list.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, that was a good one.  We scored a few converts on that long lived thread.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;The IntraServer cards are awesome.  I like the SCSI cards based on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Symbios chipsets.  It appears that a company called LSI Logic acquired
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Symbios (or maybe they just got renamed ?).  Anyway, checkout their 64bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;PCI card with two Ultra3 buses (320MB/s aggregate!):
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;<A HREF="http://www.lsilogic.com/techlib/io_standard/sym22915.pdf">http://www.lsilogic.com/techlib/io_standard/sym22915.pdf</A>
</EM><BR>
<P>LSI bought Symbios Logic from Hyundai (or was it Mitsubishi?).  The reason
<BR>
I recommend IntraServer is because they directly support just about every
<BR>
platform, plus the Tru 64 OS requires an IntraServer to enable U2 and other
<BR>
advanced features, even if your stock LSI has the same ASIC and feature set
<BR>
(driver hacks to make you get certified hardware).
<BR>
<P>I also really like Qlogic boards, they have the superb ability to dump
<BR>
their NVRAM to a text file, let you tune it by hand and shoot it back into
<BR>
the NVRAM to use your new settings (you can reach all those settings the
<BR>
config utility won't let you touch).  By the way, do you know if the newer
<BR>
Alpha workstation and servers use the later QLA1040B controllers or are
<BR>
they still shipping with QLA1020x (SCSI II Fast, Fast/Wide)? I was sure Tru
<BR>
64 and Open VMS were supporting the later Ultra family of Qlogic at least
<BR>
(don't think they support one U2 boot controller yet).
<BR>
<P>You might be interested to check out the source for the driver from their
<BR>
beta driver download page (not for NT, for Linux).  I'd like to hear from
<BR>
you what you think of their code.
<BR>
<P>Other than LSI based controllers and QLogic (Atto is one of their OEM
<BR>
partners), I'm not impressed by most of the other controllers out there.
<BR>
Mylex's re-named Buslogic controllers are close, but lack the tools and
<BR>
hackability of the above favorites (at least in my experience).
<BR>
<P>Warm sloshing regards,
<BR>
<P>--Kirk E
