<P>
<EM>&gt; Maybe that's too much to hope for from such a diverse group, but,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if it did happen, and if Compaq threw their support in that direction, we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might be able spend less time on the kinds of problems that now fill this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; list, and more on the work for which we originally bought our alphas.
</EM><BR>
<P>Compaq's goal in life is to encourage as many good Linux distributions
<BR>
as possible for the Alpha. Right now I have seen them working with
<BR>
RedHat, SuSe, and Debian. I don't think they are going to change their
<BR>
minds.
<BR>
<P>What we as a community could do would be to have some webpages which
<BR>
do a better job of tracking what's wrong with various distributions,
<BR>
e.g. our own errata pages. Then people could not only fix their
<BR>
systems, they could see what other distributions might have fewer
<BR>
bugs. We all agree that the distributions themselves don't always do a
<BR>
good job of reporting their own bugs.
<BR>
<P>Volunteers? What I imagine is some webpages split up by distribution
<BR>
and release name in which people could create items and comment on
<BR>
existing items. For example: RedHat 5.2: &quot;man&quot; is broken and
<BR>
segfaults; later someone could add &quot;fix now on redhat site&quot;, etc.
