<EM>&gt;&gt; Do you use a lot of swap space during normal system opration?

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yes. Why?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm guessing the other people that have the lockup problem are using a lot
<BR>
of swap as well.  The exact pattern of the death of my machine is that it
<BR>
will run for about 3 to 20 days then randomly it will just fall over dead
<BR>
after running like a champ.  
<BR>
<P>I've been debugging it like made for about a year and the only information
<BR>
that I have found usefull is located here: 
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.theshell.com/~blyon/crash/">http://www.theshell.com/~blyon/crash/</A>
<BR>
<P>That is what happened two crashes ago.
<BR>
<P>In all of my crash reports the same thing happened.  The system was using
<BR>
about 150-300 megs of swap and then for whatever reason all the swap space
<BR>
on the system was used in a 3 minute period of time and the box then just
<BR>
dies. 
<BR>
<P>When the system got so busy with the swap all the cpu was eaten by the
<BR>
system and all sorts of other side effects happened.  I've set ulimits on
<BR>
all the userspace stuff to prevent this odd leak in the event that it is a
<BR>
user problem.
<BR>
<P>If this is the exact same problem in your case then we might have a kernel
<BR>
issue.  I will send you my data collection script so that we can see if you
<BR>
are having the same problem.

<BR>
[A]: Sure they do... &quot;It compiles, it's ready!&quot;
