<EM>&gt; Well, 2.3.23 pre patch 1 is running on my system without any problems 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nor any warnings, using bttv, and frame buffer...
</EM><BR>
While this is true, it should not be used to extrapolate a general trend 
<BR>
for all 2.3.x kernels.  They are, as was mentioned by someone else,
<BR>
experimental kernels.  A few months ago I coded an axp asm implementation 
<BR>
of mmap to fix a problem in a dev kernel.  Something like that 
<BR>
is &quot;new&quot; and has the potential to break things - other kernel coders 
<BR>
take the same attitude, and you end up with a lot of volatile code 
<BR>
in the dev kernels.  In other words, expect things to break between
<BR>
minor revisions - it is expected. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; It seems that some intel modification impacting general code were made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without reporting the change on the alpha.
</EM><BR>
I don't know how others feel about this, but that turns my knobs
<BR>
the wrong way.  This is a recurring problem which I've brought up in
<BR>
the past, without changes.  Portions of code in mm/, include/linux/
<BR>
and kernel/ have needed &quot;sanitization&quot; to clean them of x86 opcodes
<BR>
in recent releases.
<BR>
<P>What drives people to slap [insert favorite arch] opcodes into 
<BR>
architecture-neutral areas of the kernel is beyond me.  It's not 
<BR>
just poor coding practice, it's very rude to someone using any of
<BR>
the other supported architectures.
<BR>
