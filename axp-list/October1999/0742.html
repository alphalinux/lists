I've been working with the Red Hat folks to get clock/hwclock
<BR>
working on Jensen, and as of this morning, hwclock works very
<BR>
nicely. :-) I'm sure the updated util-linux will be in the
<BR>
next Raw Hide release, but don't quote me. So 6.1 should be better
<BR>
out of the box on Jensen's. If you do a strace on awk you'll see
<BR>
there is an iotcl() call hanging. I'm looking into this too and
<BR>
RH are aware of it. They don't have a Jensen to test on though.
<BR>
<P>As for a generic kernel that runs on Jensen, that is the remaining
<BR>
piece of the puzzle. Unrelated to this, if anyone can get a DE-422
<BR>
going on a Jensen, please share the knowledge with everyone. ;-)

Subject: Things broken on Jensen
<BR>
<P><P>I have downloaded 6.1 SRPMS yesterday &amp; will try to to kick off a 
<BR>
built on my jensen. According to Michael's older post, clock is 
<BR>
expected to be fixed in 6.1. for last 3 days I have been trying to find 
<BR>
otu why gawk is broken on jensen. I have reached a point where I 
<BR>
know exactly what is broken, but don't yet know the solution. I will 
<BR>
keep yall posted( or if entire list doesn't want to be bothered, I will e-
<BR>
mail Michael &amp; Tom )
