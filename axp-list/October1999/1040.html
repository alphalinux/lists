Actually this is also incorrect.  The coppermine processors do not use the new
<BR>
IBM Copper interconnects.  They just happen to have a code name that makes
<BR>
people think that they do.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; With Coppermine only slightly slower at a given clock rate,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; there is little incentive to buy Athlon. (except those folks who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; despise Intel)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think being substantially cheaper makes a good incentive. Of course the current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Athlon's are not copper yet. This has Intel comparing a newer technology to an older
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one and still failing. the Dresden fab will be cranking out Copper Athlon processors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very soon, which will widen the gap that AMD already leads in even more.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There is little to no incentive to waste your money on the Intel processors,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; especially considering Intel's track record. Athlon has a vastly superior motherboard.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You will not be upgrading your system with a new motherboard every 4-6 months like you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will with Intel just to stay current.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I went through this with Alphas.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I bought a 533mhz. Alpha system back whenb they were 4995.00 (several years ago) beat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the hell out of any of the Intel offerings for speed. (I use Lightwave 3D for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; animation) A friend of mine bought a new PC system that was top off the line back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then) over the last few years, to stay current he has bought 5 motherboards just to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stay current, going from an AT motherboard to an early ATX, then the socket 7 was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; limited to 200mhz, so he had to get a different board to accomodate socket 7 with MMX,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then to PII, he bought a 233, 266, 300 etc. just to keep up. completely changed ram
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; twice as I recall going from his original to EDO and then to SDRAM. during all these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changes and the thousands of extra dollars he spent, his Intel box ended up costing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; WAY more than I paid for my Alpha box, and he still could not lay any claim to being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; faster or for that matter even close. MY original Alpha just keeps working right
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; along, no upgrades, no modifications, no swapping parts and it still fares well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against even the newest of Intel systems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The Athlon, long term is going to be the same way. All the hardware sites say Intel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has hit the wall with their outdated technology, and all have said the Athlon has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; barely scratched the surface.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Where then is your incentive to buy Intel unless you are only interested in the Intel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Inside sticker?
