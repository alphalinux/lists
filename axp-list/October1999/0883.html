Hello again!
<BR>
<P>Thank you all for your replies earlier to my 2940U2W troubles while
<BR>
installing Red Hat 6 on Alpha.  Unfortunately, I still haven't been able
<BR>
to make it work.
<BR>
<P>I have two disks:
<BR>
&nbsp;- One Fast-10 SCSI hanging off the onboard NCR SCSI interface
<BR>
&nbsp;- One Ultra2 LVD on the Adaptec 2940U2W
<BR>
<P>I intend to keep the one disk on the onboard controller for the purposes
<BR>
of booting with MILO, etc.  The problem remains that, as long as the
<BR>
Adaptec card is seated in its PCI slot, the Red Hat generic.img kernel
<BR>
won't boot.
<BR>
<P>To get around this, I built both 2.2.12 and 2.2.13 kernels on an Alpha
<BR>
with support for the NCR and the Adaptec, and tried grafting each onto an
<BR>
existing Red Hat 6.0 generic boot floppy (replacing /vmlinux.gz).  The
<BR>
result was a boot disk that succesfully booted with or without the Adaptec
<BR>
(hooray!) but refused to load the ramdisk image off of its floppy!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;VFS: Insert root floppy disk to be loaded into RAM disk and press ENTER
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;RAMDISK: Compressed image found at block 0
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 01:00
<BR>
<P>it says.  Which is a silly notion, since I know I compiled in ramdisk
<BR>
support in both of the kernels I tried...
<BR>
<P>I would be grateful if anyone knows what's biting me this time.
<BR>
Argh.
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
Scott
