<P>
The premiere issue of Maximum Linux has been in stores and is getting harder
<BR>
to find, but I picked up a copy and installed Linux Mandrake on my x86 box.
<BR>
Apparently it's &quot;Red Hat Linux modified&quot; with better tweaks, compiled with
<BR>
pgcc, has has some of the annoyances (?) from RH 6 taken out.  If you like
<BR>
Red Hat (and I assume most of us do :-) has anyone considered pushing
<BR>
Mandrake for Alpha?  Shouldn't be too hard since RH already supports
<BR>
Alpha..right?  One of  the nice things is the mandrake.org site and the
<BR>
community that goes along with it.  It is catered towards the new to
<BR>
intermediate, but very user friendly.  Although their target is to make
<BR>
&quot;Linux for the desktop&quot; or &quot;Making Linux easy&quot; it's not really that much
<BR>
different than what Red Hat has done (they use the same installer and setup
<BR>
Gnome, KDE, and Anotherlevel for you).
