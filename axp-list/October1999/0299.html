<P><EM>&gt; On another note, how profitable is Alpha for RedHat?

<EM>&gt; Personally, I downloaded RH-6.0 and burned a CD for

<EM>&gt; my 5 machines (1 old, 1 very old, 3 ancient)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Later on, I purchased a copy of RH-6.0-Alpha, just to &quot;show support&quot;.

<P>We might not really have a way of knowing how profitable it is, but I'll
<BR>
provide at least one data point.  The only official Redhat CDs I've ever bought
<BR>
were the Alpha 5.1 release and the 5.2 &quot;variety pack&quot; (for Alpha, x86, and
<BR>
Sparc CDs).  6.0 was just too expensive to buy officially.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Add to that the fact that there are more intels out there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It wouldn't surprise me to hear [100-to-1] [intel-to-alpha] sales numbers.
</EM><BR>
<P>That doesn't mean that they make no money on it.  Anyone know how much extra it
<BR>
costs them to rebuild the distro on Alphas?  They certainly don't seem to spend
<BR>
much time actually testing it once done.  This is just an observation, as there
<BR>
seem to be more stupid things broken on the Alpha distribution (man broken? 
<BR>
MAN???) than the Intel one.
