Thanks Paul, I now see the effect of an all-night drinking binge
<BR>
exemplified. :)
<BR>
<P>Yep, UltraSCSI is 20 MHz, Ultra2 is 40 MHz and Ultra3 is 80 MHz.  I also
<BR>
neglected to mention that a new SCSI controller would be necessary to
<BR>
achieve the rate.  Cabling and termination must be within about 2% of the
<BR>
90 Ohm impedence and must be LVD (Low Voltage Differential) or the
<BR>
controller will revert the bus to &quot;safer&quot; UltraSCSI speeds.  
<BR>
<P>My point on UltraSCSI versus Ultra2 (which was admittedly lost completely)
<BR>
is that the internal transfer rate of the drives between UltraSCSI and
<BR>
Ultra2 (even with newer electronics to optimize such things as prefetch and
<BR>
dynamically reconfigurable segmented caches) are little more than a few
<BR>
percent faster.  On a system in which there will be 3 or fewer drives, the
<BR>
Ultra2 spec doesn't offer a significant performance improvement since U2's
<BR>
primary performance advantage is in disk arrays (I'm becoming more lucid,
<BR>
can you tell?)
<BR>
<P>My current favorites for cross-OS support on ALpha is the IntraServer
<BR>
series of controllers, some of which feature one or more U or U2
<BR>
controllers and a Fast Ethernet controller, all on one board.  
<BR>
<P>Thanks for providing clarity Paul,
<BR>

<EM>&gt;The 40Mhz signalling rate (80Mhz is Ultra3 which isn't really out in any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;force yet) is only performed when ALL devices on the bus are electrically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;happy to drive the bus with low-voltage differential (LVD) protocol.  This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*improves* the electrical transfer properties, and *increases* the maximum
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cabling distances (to 25M IIRC) and decreases the chance of parity errors or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;transmission retries.  If the controller (Initiator) detects the presence of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*any* device or terminator incapable of using Ultra2 SCSI (LVD) then the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whole bus reverts to std Ultra SCSI with all the cabling limitations and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;speeds.  This is why it is important to make sure that all devices on an LVD
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bus are in fact true LVD devices.  Some SCSI vendors such as Sony with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;SDT-9000 DDS4 DAT drive claim that their device is Ultra2/LVD compatible --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but what they mean is that it can be used on an LVD bus in SE (Single-ended)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mode.  This clobbers the whole bus to SE, and again you are limited to 1.5M
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;length (3M if 4 devices or less) and max 40MB/sec (ie 20Mhz signalling with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;UW) transfer rates.  One thing easy to overlook is the terminators.  You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*must* use LVD terminators if you don't want your bus to run as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;single-ended std Ultra bus.
</EM><BR>
