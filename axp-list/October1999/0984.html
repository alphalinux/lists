<EM>&gt; that the rumor about the Athlon is that it can do 200MHz bus.  It can accomplish

<P>With Coppermine only slightly slower at a given clock rate,
<BR>
there is little incentive to buy Athlon. (except those folks who
<BR>
despise Intel)
<BR>
<P>Intel introduced the 840 chipset with the new cpus and that does 
<BR>
support high performance memory. I just looked at it's specs and
<BR>
it is capable of a maximum of 3.2GB/sec, but I suspect a single
<BR>
cpu will get no more than 1.6GB/sec since it uses two RDRAM channels.
<BR>
That chipset looks pricey though. I also read there were MB 
<BR>
makers that were going to release 820 based boards but only
<BR>
put two memory slots on it to keep from triggering the bug in 
<BR>
the chipset.
<BR>
<P>Athlon MB manuals state they support double data rate SDRAM 
<BR>
(DDR SDRAM??) but I haven't found anyone who makes them to 
<BR>
try it out. I have Athlons for test systems but am currently 
<BR>
running PC100 SDRAM. They are definitely faster than older 
<BR>
PII/PIII at the same clock rate.
