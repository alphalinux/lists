If you check in the archive you'll see some traffic on this topic.  I'll give you a brief rundown of what I remember.
<BR>
<P>1)  The Multia (UDB) in particular and some other platforms have had trouble determining which connection is in use.  The solution has been to force the connection type.  One way that has worked is to go to the SRM console specify the appropriate value for the variable ewa0_mode IIRC.  Do a &quot;sho | more&quot; at the SRM console and it will sho you all of the variables.  Some have also said if you use modules that specifying the media type there works.
<BR>
<P>2) Check your network driver there have been discussions concerning the need for specific or newest drivers depending on platform and kernels.
<BR>
<P>3) There have been problems with some of the Multia's in the past.  Some folks have reported that the 10Base2 (Coax, BNC) port does not work but the other two do.  Others have reported problems with the 10BaseT (RJ45, twisted pair) but fine on the other two.
<BR>
<P>Hope this helps.
<BR>
<P>Calvin.

I'm trying to get a Multia talking to an AlphaStation. Both have built in
<BR>
ethernet and right now I just have the two hooked up via a (working)
<BR>
hub and (working) cat-5 cables.
<BR>
<P>Both are using modules for tulip on eth0.
<BR>
<P>It looks my software configuration is OK. I used the netconf tool and
<BR>
double checked the effected configuration files to be sure they were
<BR>
doing the right thing.
<BR>
<P>Problem is I get host unreachable messages from ping.
<BR>
<P>Also, I get a SIOCADDRT message when running the route command.
<BR>
And even though I have the /etc/networks file in place, I still get IP
<BR>
numbers from &quot;netstat -r&quot; and not the aliased network names.
<BR>
<P>Can anyone shed some light on this setup? It's just a basic two machine
<BR>
hookup via a hub and I know the hardware is fine. I must be missing
<BR>
something
<BR>
very basic.
<BR>
