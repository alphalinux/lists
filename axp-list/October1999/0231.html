<EM>&gt;         I'd like to pull the source &amp; compile under 2.2.12, but I'm not sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which RPMs comprise the source/headers - can someone send me a pointer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.alphalinux.org/kernel/v2.2/">ftp://ftp.alphalinux.org/kernel/v2.2/</A> appears to have kernel images in bz2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; format - but what handles that compression?)
</EM><BR>
<P>If you're looking to recompile, it's probably best to stay away from
<BR>
RPM's.  For the kernel source, you can get it in either .gz or .bz2
<BR>
compressed formats.  .bz2 is smaller (and transfers faster), but you
<BR>
need a bzip2 uncompressor for it, which are still relatively uncommon.
<BR>
<P>Pretty much every Linux machine has gunzip, so go ahead and get the
<BR>
.gz'd version.  Same thing.  :-)

<EM>&gt;         Also - what's the appropriate way to shut down this system?  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never seems to respond to init 0 or 6 with what I expect to see on an Intel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; box.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm a fan of &quot;halt&quot; or &quot;reboot&quot;... the &quot;shutdown&quot; command will also help
<BR>
(see the man page).
<BR>

<BR>
<EM>&gt;         What Internet browser is available for the Alpha?  I tried to load
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mozilla but ran into all kinds of issues with missing RPMs that I could not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; locate for installation.  Is there a (stable) Netscape version for Alpha?
</EM><BR>
<P>Be a man; use lynx ;-)
<BR>
<P>Seriously, if you have access to various DEC Unix libs, you can get a
<BR>
&quot;real&quot; Netscape working.  That's what I ended up doing here.

<BR>
<EM>&gt;         I'm an X newbie - what should I read?  I see a lot of perms errors &amp;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cores.....

<P>If you're using GNOME and friends, make sure you're running the latest
<BR>
version... for Red Hat Linux 6.0, errata are at

<A HREF="http://support.redhat.com/.">http://support.redhat.com/.</A>  The difference was astounding for me -- my

work PC has been going since September 10th without any GUI crashes, vs.
<BR>
about 4 hours with the stock GNOME.  -rt
