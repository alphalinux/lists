<P>
I've been running 5.1 + mods on my Ruffian very happily for nearly a year
<BR>
now, and broke down and decided to try getting 6.0 to run.
<BR>
<P>hahahahahahaha.
<BR>
<P>If i follow the instructions for making a boot disc, and boot from my
<BR>
already-installed milo from the floppy, it decompresses two lines of #
<BR>
then hangs for a bit.
<BR>
<P>After a while, it starts printing out
<BR>
<P>PYXIS machine check NOT expected
<BR>
pyxis_machine_check: vector=0x670 la_ptr=0xfffffc000020a5a0
<BR>
oo pc=0xfffffc00007a6180 size=0x1b8 procoffset=0xd8 sysoffset 0x160
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^
<BR>
<P>The last four digits of pc change, and the screen scrolls by for a long
<BR>
time until it stops at 68c0. The previous number was 6680.
<BR>
<P>And then it's well and truly hung.
<BR>
<P>I've tried to get it to boot my old kernel from my sda2 partition and
<BR>
mount the cdrom as root, but it hangs when it tries to mount the cdrom:
<BR>
ncr53c875-0-&lt;5,*&gt;: SYNC transfers not supported
<BR>
CDROM not ready. Make sure there is a disc in the drive.

<BR>
<P>Erm. Odd questions. This is my bios info:
<BR>
ARCS BIOS 1.3.061/SN3010000.51088A	APC 164UX/BX	67MHz/600MHz
<BR>
21164A Rev 5
<BR>
<P>The RedHat book cheerfully tells me to upgrade my bios, but this is a
<BR>
non-Digital board, so i've not been able to find a new bios yet. I've
<BR>
not tried upgrading my milo yet. [I'm a little leery about replacing
<BR>
the milo currently installed which *works* with a milo which may not
<BR>
work.]
<BR>
<P>Any hints on what i'm doing wrong or how i should modify the install
<BR>
routine? I know that at least *some* other people are running 6.0 on
<BR>
a Ruffian, and i'm wondering what they did that i've not clued to yet...
<BR>
<P>tia,
<BR>
