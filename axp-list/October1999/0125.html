Red,
<BR>
<P>I'm affraid that isn't possible for two reasons:
<BR>
<P>1) UP2000 is a Slot B motherboard (even though it is using the Tsunami
<BR>
chipset, minus a few D chips) shipping with AlphaBIOS firmware console and
<BR>
only AlphaBIOS code.
<BR>
<P>2) UP2000 and Slot B in general still have no SRM firmware and no
<BR>
associated PALcode (plus, you need certification of hardware to run Tru 64).
<BR>
<P>UP2000 was released by API prior to the big &quot;news&quot; of Alpha/NT
<BR>
discontinuance.  This is an &quot;NT Only&quot; system running AlphaBIOS 5.7 and
<BR>
supplied with NT HAL and Palcode.  You would be guessing right if you
<BR>
realized that you need SRM firmware to support Tru64 (or OpenVMS, or BSD
<BR>
UNIX, or Linux using Aboot code).  There is not SRM available for any Slot
<BR>
B motherboard as yet, I have brought this up to Compaq (who own the code)
<BR>
and API (who build the boards).  Right now all the API Slot B boards are
<BR>
running AlphaBIOS which has reached the same status as NT (discontinued,
<BR>
the team has been re-assigned or laid off). No future revs of AlphaBIOS
<BR>
will be released (unless a bug fix for the 64 bit NT development team is
<BR>
needed, 2 engineers are left to do this) or SRM replaces AlphaBIOS in all
<BR>
new Alpha systems. We are in a time where it is far from clear which one of
<BR>
these is going to happen.  Compaq has seen fit not to consider this before
<BR>
making their final moves.
