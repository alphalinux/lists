<EM>&gt; I don't see what all this talk of Intel processors and clock speed has to

<EM>&gt; do with the actual available performance of Alphas?  I mean, who cares if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an x86 gets to 1Ghz before an Alpha.  My current integer benchmarks using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ccc on a 21164A at 600Mhz show that you would need an x86 of well over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1Ghz to get similar performance.  Given that the 21264 should be around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; twice as quick again I don't see that Alpha has anything to worry about.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you are not seeing much difference in performance from your code on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Intel and Alpha then you should probably look at modifying the code to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make it perform better on the Alpha.  At least now with ccc we are seeing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the sort of performance we expect from Alpha.  Look at what Intel et al
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are having to do to get performance out of their chips, supercooling and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; .18 micron processes and the things are still slower than a .35 micron
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha at room temperature.

<P>I've tuned code a long time. An Athlon is approxmately 0.3-0.55 of a
<BR>
21264, even using Compaq's FORTRAN on the 21264 at the same MHZ.
<BR>
If you see a bigger difference, it is probably library related codes.
<BR>
(sin/cos/etc) The SPEC benchmarks also agree with what I've seen so
<BR>
I'm fairly certain it's a reasonable ratio. If I can buy a 1GHZ
<BR>
Athlon for $1.5K or so, that's better price performance than Alphas.
<BR>
If one could get the compiler to issue AMD's multimedia instructions,
<BR>
the Athlon would have a peak performance of 2GFLOPS at 500MHZ, Alpha
<BR>
21264 is 1GHZ. Unfortunately, that doesn't work with egcs/gcc, at least
<BR>
not yet. I hope someone is thinking about it. The main problem with
<BR>
Athlon is it's memory bandwidth I believe, and perhaps using DDR-SDRAM
<BR>
would help there but finding that kind of memory seems impossible.
<BR>
I'd buy a 128MB stick if I could find it.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, this a bit off topic so thats it for me on this topic.
