<P>
<EM>&gt; pretty small. Given the general distribution, I do the work required
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to get things working in my niche. That's my focus. No one else really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shares it (I have very particular ideas about how things should work),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nor do I expect them to.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I think most people using Linux choose the most practical
<BR>
tool to get the job done - regardless of where the solution comes from.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So, in short, I don't see how &quot;we&quot; are going to focus on anything.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We're an anarchy, just like the rest of Linux.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely.  Linux has, does, and will continue to grow through 
<BR>
creative chaos.  The question of focus comes into play when dealing with
<BR>
entities like the media and software companies.  The tech community
<BR>
and media have a notion that Alpha systems are very fast, very
<BR>
powerful, and very expensive - reserved for special purpose, server
<BR>
applications and not suitable for the desktop.  Whenever Linux users at
<BR>
work find out that I've got a couple Alphas at home, the typical reaction
<BR>
is &quot;Oh my god, are you rich or something?&quot;.  To them, Alphas are just
<BR>
multiprocessor, large-memory systems in a 500lbs+ chassis that 
<BR>
sit in machine rooms surrounded by accolytes with portable cooling
<BR>
units.  Many people not of the DEC^H^H^HCompaq persuasion do not
<BR>
realize that Alphas make nice desktop systems as well.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting back to the original question of self-sustainment vs.
<BR>
adaptation.. If the attitude is one of self-sustainment, these wrong 
<BR>
ideas about the Alpha platform are not an issue to be dealt with; people
<BR>
likely to use AlphaLinux already know the truth.  Adaptation would be to
<BR>
present AlphaLinux as both a good server and desktop platform - breaking
<BR>
the usual stereotype that Alphas make good servers but not much else. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's an issue that belongs more in the realm of marketing departments 
<BR>
and corporate strategies than anywhere else.  The question was asked of
<BR>
the Alpha Linux Org by Alpha Processor Inc. earlier this year - do you
<BR>
focus on a narrow niche (scientific apps, graphics, etc.) or on a broader
<BR>
market (video games, desktop systems), or both (anarchy)? To be fair, API
<BR>
should have sent the survey to axp-list and other Linux mailing lists;
<BR>
if we had a working 'poll' on the ALO website, my question would be there
<BR>
rather than here :-)
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
Dan
