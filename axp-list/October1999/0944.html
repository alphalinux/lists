<P>
The replies seem to want to educate me about the many ways that these
<BR>
warnings may be spurious messages for perfectly good code, or that I
<BR>
suggested the wrong way to fix these, or that I used the wrong compiler,
<BR>
or how to fix my clock.  Fine.  That's not my point.  Among other things,
<BR>
I didn't build the rpms to install them (not after spending months trying
<BR>
to get a semi-stable 6.0 system), just to find out where problems may
<BR>
be lurking.
<BR>
<P>My point is that these messages often indicate real problems, and that
<BR>
there are one hell of a lot of them.  And I see enough &quot;unaligned access&quot;
<BR>
messages in /var/log/messages and crashes of various tools from RH 6.0 to
<BR>
indicate that there are real problems lurking among these many warning
<BR>
messages.  People don't have to address that point in their replies,
<BR>
but I have a feeling that my previous mail to the list didn't make that
<BR>
point clearly enough.
