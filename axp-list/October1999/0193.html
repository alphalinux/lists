<EM>&gt; &gt; Recently I submitted an &quot;official&quot; bug report
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (after a font change from a theme selector in CC the whole X locks up;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a power switch time if you cannot telnet in).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is a bug in either the X font server (xfs) or egcs which manifests
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; itself when xfs is compiled with optimization. As a result of the xfs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crash, the X server locks up.
</EM><BR>
<P>This particular thing seems to be hardly applicable as I am not using
<BR>
xfs, at least not explicitely, and have all font directories listed
<BR>
in my XF86Config.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The latest XFree86 packages in Rawhide build xfs without optimization on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which means that I would probably have to recompile the whole X myself
<BR>
as binary archives from Rawhide are likely for glibc2.1 and I am
<BR>
using glibc2.  I guess that I will edit font strings &quot;by-hand&quot; for
<BR>
the moment. :-)  This works just fine.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Please make sure you're using the latest Gnome stuff from ftp.gnome.org -
</EM><BR>
<P>I do not want to go into all details on a list which is not really a
<BR>
gnome development list but sources I am using are fairly recent and
<BR>
often the most recent available.  Assorted problems still remain but
<BR>
there is a huge qualitative difference between what is available now
<BR>
and what was distributed as &quot;Gnome for Alpha&quot; in RH 6.0 set.  The later
<BR>
could be described politely as &quot;a proof of concept&quot;, if one would try to
<BR>
be really kind; the current version is actually quite nice to use even
<BR>
if various wrinkles still show up.  This, of course, means that
<BR>
Gnome is currently moving ahead in quite brisk pace.
<BR>
<P>There are some things I miss.  For example - if I will position a window
<BR>
in such way that is title bar sticks over a top screen edge (it happens
<BR>
accidentally or some programs open a window which is too high) then it
<BR>
does not seem to be a way to reposition that window; there is no &quot;Window
<BR>
Operations&quot; menu, no key combinations to shift it down a bit (you can
<BR>
send it to another desktop but a relative position will not change), no
<BR>
option to move windows in a pager.  Edge resistance is way too small for
<BR>
my taste and does not seem to be a way to change it.  And my mouse is
<BR>
way too overworked.  All these seem to be deficiencies in enlightment
<BR>
rather than in Gnome itself but this is still a default window manager.
