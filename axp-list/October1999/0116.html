<P>
The problem I was having turned out to be the hard disk. For some reason,
<BR>
my Jensen didn't like my 1GB Quantum Fireball. I put in a DEC 2GB drive
<BR>
and the install went fine. Very strange since the Fireball works on an
<BR>
XLT-300
<BR>
and an AXPpci33. 
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I followed the install on Tom's recent website, and by following the
<BR>
dialog on this list. I have nothing to add to that procedure, as it worked
<BR>
fine.
<BR>
I used the jensen2.img and the updated RH ramdisk.
<BR>
<P>My hardware is stock, with a DE422 EtherWorks and a #9 GXE video card.
<BR>
<P>I tried booting the default RH 6.0 kernel...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; boot -fl i dka0
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<EM>aboot&gt; 3/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.5-16 root=/dev/sda3
</EM><BR>
<P>It gets to kswapd and then hangs. :-( Does anyone know why the generic
<BR>
kernel shipped with Red Hat fails on the Jensen? It works on my other boxes.
<BR>
:-(
<BR>
<P>I then copied the jensen3.img (static monolithic kernel image) onto the
<BR>
beginning
<BR>
of the disk and tried booting with that...
<BR>
<P><EM>aboot&gt; 0/2.2.12.gz root=/dev/sda3
</EM><BR>
<P>Now it hangs while starting the portmapper daemon. Damn!
<BR>
<P>Finally, I got in using single user mode...
<BR>
<P><EM>aboot&gt; 0/2.2.12.gz root=/dev/sda3 single
</EM><BR>
<P>At this point the clock was hosed. It looks like RH ships the fixed clock
<BR>
(type 
<BR>
&quot;clock -h&quot; and you'll see the -J Jensen option. The only change should be to
<BR>
add a line to one of the rc* scripts in /etc/rc.d to add a &quot;-J&quot; option after
<BR>
the
<BR>
&quot;-A&quot; clock option. That *should* fix the Jensen clock but I had other fish
<BR>
to fry.
<BR>
<P>I commented out all the daemon lines in the /etc/rc.d area. I rebooted and
<BR>
managed
<BR>
to get in this time in multi-user mode.
<BR>
<P>I did get warnings about System.map, but no big deal.
<BR>
<P>At this point was able to get X up and running. I used the S3 server, 8-bit
<BR>
depth and
<BR>
1024x768. Higher resolutions resulted in flicker and off-center display. I
<BR>
tried out some
<BR>
16-bit modes too but the pixels were &quot;fat&quot; on the display and generally
<BR>
mangled. :-(
<BR>
Also, when leaving X, the console display is completely screwed no matter
<BR>
what mode
<BR>
I exit from.
<BR>
<P>I had to add the option &quot;nolinear&quot; to get X going but otherwise KDE came up
<BR>
fine.
<BR>
<P>So that's where I'm at. If anyone figures out how to get the stock RH kernel
<BR>
working
<BR>
in multi-user mode, I'd very much appreciate it. Please post it to the list
<BR>
so everyone
<BR>
benefits, and I'll let anyone know if I solve anything else.
<BR>
<P>/Michael
