<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; have never seen beta releases for Redhat on Alpha.

<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Sure you have, remember the 5.9 beta? Keep in mind that this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; public beta release trend is fairly recent - in the past, testing was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; done behind closed doors.  One of the big problems RH has right
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; now is a lack of staff who use/want to use the Alpha platform.  Last I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; heard - about 3 months ago - there was only one engineer with an Alpha on 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; his desk.  Maybe somebody at RH would like to chime in and correct me? I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; hope? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This brings some concern and a question - which distribution has the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; potential on Alpha platform?  By potential I mean widespread and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; popularity, commitment to development, maintaince and support.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What do we have now?  Redhat, Debian, SuSe, TurboLinux and Stampede
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are list on alphalinux.org.  TurboLinux does not yet support
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alpha, Stampede is a pgcc distrubution, which implies Pentium family
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only ( please correct me if I'm wrong ).  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>TurboLinux has not yet released their Alpha
<BR>
distribution, but I have seen the beta running and
<BR>
they are working on it. 
<BR>
<P>As for Stampede, it struck
<BR>
me a little strange they were doing an Alpha dist
<BR>
(being pgcc based and all) so I at one point
<BR>
removed them from the page. However since then
<BR>
people have written to us stating that they are
<BR>
indeed doing Alpha, but I have had no official
<BR>
word from Stampede for a while.
