<EM>&gt; &gt; With regards to your message at 08:28 AM 10/15/99 -0700, Stephen Williams.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Where you stated:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;I've cleaned up some SCSI issues (a new disk, and termination has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;set straight) but I'm still seeing hanging troubles. Once it a while, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;machine will just hang. When I try to reboot with Alt-SysRq-B I see MILO
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;messages up to, but not includeing the &quot;Calibrating Delay Loop&quot; message.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;It prints the memory size and stops.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;A reset resumes it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Ideas?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I am still suspicious of the Adaptec.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Can you borrow a Symbios Logic based card, such as an Intraserver to test
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it with?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I thought earlier in this thread someone already said
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they had hangs with a Symbios based card in their box??

<P>Well, my 164LX still hangs sporadicly, though I'm not sure it's related to
<BR>
the above problem.  My machine doesn't hang on boot, but randomly under load.
<BR>
I have *no* further ideas about how to fix or debug the problem.  
<BR>
<P>Once again, here are the symptoms: Machine hangs.  I have had it totally lock
<BR>
up, but I've also had it hang in an intermediate state where it is still
<BR>
pingable.  Once console switching even worked, but not out of X.  It seems to
<BR>
help if I build a non-modular kernel.  It still happens, but less frequently.
<BR>
It also seems to be more frequent under X, but I've had it happen without X.
<BR>
Same for the network - happens more frequently under heavy net traffic, but
<BR>
still happens without the network configured.  It also seems less likely if I
<BR>
boot from AlphaBIOS/Milo rater than SRM/aboot.  When it hangs from the console
<BR>
(not X) I sometimes get dumped back into SRM.  It says &quot;exit code 7.  Machine
<BR>
check while in PALmode.&quot; (from memory).  I have played with examining the
<BR>
registers, but see no clear pattern.
<BR>
<P>Hardware: 164LX2/533MHz.  Elsa GLoria Synergy 8MB (Permedia2).  4GB Segate
<BR>
(ST34321A) IDE disk.  Built in CMD646 controller.  Booting through SRM/aboot.
<BR>
<P>I have tried moving my hard drive and video card to another identical machine
<BR>
and had the same problems.  I've also tried using an S3 Virge Trio64 card with
<BR>
the same behavior.  This seems to be independant of which kernel version I'm
<BR>
running.  I've tried 2.0.36 and 2.2.[7-12].  Currently I'm running
<BR>
2.2.13pre14, and it's been up for four days...
<BR>
<P>I'm at a loss.  I know other people are running on similar hardware.  We have
<BR>
3 other machines like this one and 16 164LX4/600's which are headless
<BR>
(Beowulf).  I have also had these machines lock up on me, and I expect it's
<BR>
the same problem.  
<BR>
<P>So, does anyone have any help to offer?
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
<P>Greg
