<P>
I've been working on getting the Jensen stable with RH6.x. The clock looks
<BR>
like it will finally be fixed for RH6.1. I have been corresponding with a
<BR>
developer and most of my patches made it in. So the clock on RH6.1
<BR>
should work on the Jensen out of the box (finally!).
<BR>
<P>The other problem I'm working on is why the Jensen is hanging when starting
<BR>
up system services. The problem is not with daemon() or killproc() but with
<BR>
pidofproc(). The pidofproc() function uses awk to search the process table
<BR>
to check if a system service is already running. awk is hanging! Yes, it
<BR>
seems
<BR>
awk is broken on Jensen. :-( 
<BR>
<P>I will try to fix the problem using cut or some other means and submit the
<BR>
fix
<BR>
to RH. I believe they are changing the way this is done in Lorax anyway. For
<BR>
a workaround, you can safely comment out the awk check done in the
<BR>
/etc/rc.d/functions file. It is done twice.
<BR>
<P>The final problem is the stock kernel not working with Jensen. Building your
<BR>
own
<BR>
kernel does work. I doubt there will be a fix for this though since RH
<BR>
doesn't have
<BR>
a Jensen to test on, and I probably won't have time to do this soon. If
<BR>
anyone wants
<BR>
to take a look, please be my guest. :-)
<BR>
<P>Oh, I'm also getting spurious X crashes. Things seem very shaky. Some
<BR>
programs
<BR>
crash X when I launch them. AfterStep is one of them...then again, maybe
<BR>
AfterStep
<BR>
is using awk to do something. WindowMaker works. Hmmm.
