<P>
<EM>&gt;&gt; My guess, it will be the &quot;pretty gosh darn hard&quot; part, porting PALcode to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; something other than SRM.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; HOWEVER, i have not given up hope that you fellows will release SRM to any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; and all takers to grow the Slot B clone markets and standardize your new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; products (never really liked AlphaBIOS anyway).  If you have any leverage,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; please advise management against licensing SRM at some ridiculous price
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; that no Slot B motherboard manufacturer can afford to use in volume.  Slot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; B will only work for Compaq positively by making SURE every Slot B board
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; can be flashed to accept SRM over the PC BIOS used by the K7 Anthon.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As for SRM licensing, that one has been around the block several times.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The other thing you might want to keep in mind is that Slot-B is not a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Compaq design, and as far as I know Compaq is not using it in any of its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;boxes. 
</EM><BR>
<P>My point exactly, why!?  Slot B is an open standard (Compaq co-developed
<BR>
it, costs are entirely based on design costs, not licensing).  If Compaq
<BR>
doesn't adopt Slot B in ANY of its product offerings, what kind of signal
<BR>
does that send?  It would be like Mercedes Benze and Bosch co-developing
<BR>
Disc brakes only to continue to use less efficient drum brakes (which
<BR>
didn't happen).  Why develop something for someone else to use and gain
<BR>
nothing from it directly?  As for SRM licensing going around several times,
<BR>
someone needs to stop and consider the ramifications of NOT licensing SRM:
<BR>
<P>1) AlphaBIOS died with NT, no more AlphaBIOS
<BR>
2) Continuing to ship AlphaBIOS on systems means only Linux can be used
<BR>
(with MILO) even though it is inferior to SRM (designed to address UNIX and
<BR>
VMS)
<BR>
3) ARCSBIOS was owned by Deskstation, Deskstation is dead and it was NT
<BR>
firmware anyway.
<BR>
4) SRM is a superior firmware (with the only aspect being the lack of
<BR>
filesystem support at the firmware level ala ARC/AlphaBIOS) and would make
<BR>
a nice standard.
<BR>
5) Not licensing SRM to Slot B vendors KILLS Alpha because the clone market
<BR>
will never be able to grow without Compaq support and SRM code.
<BR>
6) Changing over to OpenBoot firmware will be lenghty, expensive and
<BR>
troublesome, the only reason to do this would be to work AROUND Compaq
<BR>
mangement, but this is nearly impossible.  No Alpha firmware for the Slot B
<BR>
market means, once again NO Alpha.  Where are these commitments we're
<BR>
hearing about, are we the only ones to see the glaring holes?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; By the way, I've seen conflicting documentation on what SRM stands for, is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; it: System Resource Monitor or System Reference Manual?  The DEC and
</EM><BR>
Compaq  websites &gt;&gt; have both listed, which is a fellow to believe?
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I always heard System Resource Manual, though I can't guarantee it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;right.
</EM><BR>
<P>System Resource Manual?  Sounds like yet another permutation of the two
<BR>
definitions, only this one makes even less sense.
