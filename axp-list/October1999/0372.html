<EM>&gt; I think I agree with the suggestions to try some different memory, if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible. Generally look in any machine check errors for lines
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mentioning &quot;630&quot; or  especially&quot;670&quot; which are often memory errors. 
</EM><BR>
<P>This damn PC164 system board takes expensive SIMMS, and takes them in
<BR>
large banks, so trying different memory is not convenient. However, the
<BR>
memory is relatively recent, and I had similar problems even before
<BR>
changing it.
<BR>
<P>Where would I find machine check errors? none seem to find their way
<BR>
into any logs I have.
<BR>
<P>I also had a hang up just now, with the 2.2.12 memory leak patch applied.
<BR>
It is true, though, that I've been running memory-intensive programs,
<BR>
namely egcs-c++ on some bison generated C++ files. (These tend to generate
<BR>
lots of disk activity too.)
<BR>
<P>*sigh* I'd be ready to blame the Adaptec board, but at least one other
<BR>
person on this list has reported similar problems with a non-adaptec
<BR>
(QLog, I think) SCSI card. And I've heard that the 2940UW is reasonably
<BR>
well supported in Linux.
