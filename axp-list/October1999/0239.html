Mike -
<BR>
<P>Here in Iowa City, IA (with the highest rate of per capita cable modem
<BR>
users) , the @Home installations have been pretty Linux friendly.  The
<BR>
installers are private contractors and seem to be lazy.  That is,
<BR>
they'll show up with the cable modem and get it hooked up and synced
<BR>
into the system.  Then the &quot;computer guy&quot; comes with 10T PCI network
<BR>
card and USB adapter in hand.  If you just ask, they'll give you all the
<BR>
network info you need to get up and running on your own and they will
<BR>
leave.  (Though my installer didn't even know what domain name or subnet
<BR>
mask to use!!)  I've had friends that didn't even let them look at their
<BR>
computer, the installer just gave the net information and left.
<BR>
<P>I let them do it their way on my windows side, and then I setup Linux
<BR>
myself.  Judging by the quality of my &quot;computer guy&quot; I doubt he even
<BR>
knows what Linux is.  I didn't even mention it to avoid confusion.
<BR>
<P>I've been through this with AT&amp;T several times with several answers.  It
<BR>
seems they are trying to use dynamic IP addresses but it isn't working.
<BR>
So, they are just giving out static IP addresses like candy. (At least
<BR>
here in Iowa City)  If you ask their customer service, they'll tell you
<BR>
that nobody has dynamic IPs.  Something funny going on it AT&amp;T
<BR>
headquarters?????????
<BR>
<P>The only downside is that you need a Win or Mac box to use the @Home
<BR>
browser plugin.  This is required to log into their system and request
<BR>
additional IP's and to check your actual assigned network information
<BR>
(which was important for me to get things fixed).  
<BR>
<P>The cable modem acts like an uplink into an Ethernet system.  Make sure
<BR>
they give you a cable modem with an Ethernet port, otherwise you're in
<BR>
big trouble.  My cable modem works fine with Linux and Win and I don't
<BR>
see why it wouldn't work on your system.
<BR>
<P>They make you nervous when they answer your technical questions
<BR>
ambiguously, but in the end everything works out and you're happy.  
<BR>
<P>Good luck -
<BR>
<P>Blake
<BR>
<P>PS - To any @Home installation people that may be reading this, please
<BR>
don't hate me or take my cable modem away!!!  But something HAS to be
<BR>
done.  The answers I've gotten from TCI/AT&amp;T on technical questions have
<BR>
been very poor, incorrect, and usually misleading.

<EM>&gt; I'm contemplating getting a cable modem from the local provider. (AT&amp;T formerly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TCI)  However, there's one catch, they want to install it on a Windows 9x/NT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; platform.  I really don't want them screwing with my other Windows machines.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So the idea is: Since I have a Multia dual booting Linux and WinNT, let the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cable people install on the WinNT partition, then setup Linux at my own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pace.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The question: Has anyone run a cable modem on a Multia with WinNT?  Will it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks!
