And I wasn't even invited to the binge!  Hurmpphh!  ;-)
<BR>
<P>Agreed -- on a bus with a single drive, your points are well founded, and
<BR>
this is similar to the wretched SCSI vs Ultra IDE debate we both survived on
<BR>
the AlphaNT list.  It is when you have a machine with many hard drives, that
<BR>
you will want to make sure that you have an U2W bus with 80MB/sec
<BR>
_bandwidth_ available.  If you have 4 drives all capable of sending 18MB/sec
<BR>
realistically, then the effective rate achieved when all drives wish to
<BR>
communicate on the bus at the same time is reduced on an UW bus to 10MB/sec
<BR>
per bus due to the 40MB/s bandwidth available.  On a U2W bus, all drives can
<BR>
deliver their data at their max rates unimpeded by the other devices because
<BR>
of the 80MB/s bandwidth.  Due to command overhead (negotiation/selection
<BR>
etc) you'll never achieve the 40MB/s or 80MB/s theoretical maximums, but all
<BR>
things being equal the U2W bus gives double throughput maximum than a UW
<BR>
bus.
<BR>
<P>The IntraServer cards are awesome.  I like the SCSI cards based on the
<BR>
Symbios chipsets.  It appears that a company called LSI Logic acquired
<BR>
Symbios (or maybe they just got renamed ?).  Anyway, checkout their 64bit
<BR>
PCI card with two Ultra3 buses (320MB/s aggregate!):

<P><P>Thanks Paul, I now see the effect of an all-night drinking binge
<BR>
exemplified. :)
<BR>
<P>Yep, UltraSCSI is 20 MHz, Ultra2 is 40 MHz and Ultra3 is 80 MHz.  I also
<BR>
neglected to mention that a new SCSI controller would be necessary to
<BR>
achieve the rate.  Cabling and termination must be within about 2% of the
<BR>
90 Ohm impedence and must be LVD (Low Voltage Differential) or the
<BR>
controller will revert the bus to &quot;safer&quot; UltraSCSI speeds.  
<BR>
<P>My point on UltraSCSI versus Ultra2 (which was admittedly lost completely)
<BR>
is that the internal transfer rate of the drives between UltraSCSI and
<BR>
Ultra2 (even with newer electronics to optimize such things as prefetch and
<BR>
dynamically reconfigurable segmented caches) are little more than a few
<BR>
percent faster.  On a system in which there will be 3 or fewer drives, the
<BR>
Ultra2 spec doesn't offer a significant performance improvement since U2's
<BR>
primary performance advantage is in disk arrays (I'm becoming more lucid,
<BR>
can you tell?)
<BR>
<P>My current favorites for cross-OS support on ALpha is the IntraServer
<BR>
series of controllers, some of which feature one or more U or U2
<BR>
controllers and a Fast Ethernet controller, all on one board.  
<BR>
<P>Thanks for providing clarity Paul,
<BR>
