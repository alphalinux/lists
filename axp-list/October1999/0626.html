<P>
Thanks to all who took the time to reply the first time.. Let me give a more
<BR>
practical explanation of why I was asking.
<BR>
<P>Two weeks ago I was  in Santa Cruz for Cisco PIX Firewall training.  Many of
<BR>
the people in my class live around the area and work for consulting
<BR>
companies who service the .COM industry.  One of the guys was explaining to
<BR>
me that he is seeing a lot of Red Hat/Apache servers popping up all over the
<BR>
place.  It's still typical to see Sun E10k servers on the back end, but
<BR>
typically your front end is either Linux (typically Red Hat) running Apache,
<BR>
or NT and IIS.
<BR>
<P>When I said &quot;cluster&quot; I really meant Web Farm.  It seems there are two
<BR>
mission critical areas for Systems.  The front end and the back end.  I
<BR>
suppose the most common approach on the front end is to setup your servers
<BR>
and use Round Robin DNS.  Let's say you have twenty servers on the front.
<BR>
If you're serving mostly static content (rootshell.com, gnome.org) I don't
<BR>
think Alpha would give a noticable gain over a Dual PII/450.  But if you're
<BR>
running some sort of dynamic web site (Google, Amazon, Lycos, mp3.com)
<BR>
wouldn't you benefit from a machine that has more cache, better FPU, and
<BR>
64-bit virtual memory space?  On the front end it's probably better to throw
<BR>
down twenty DS10 boxes than than twenty Dual PII/450 for a small to medium
<BR>
web site, isn't it?  I was at Spec.org and the specs on DS10 and DS20 crush
<BR>
any of Intel's technology right now.
<BR>
<P>The back end is where &quot;clustering&quot; comes in.. Running applications like
<BR>
Oracle and Sybase.  Is it just me or is this where Alpha really shines over
<BR>
Intel?  Of course, many are still buying Sun Enterprise 10000 clusters
<BR>
(except for ebay) - but when the time is ripe, would Alpha Linux be the
<BR>
preferred choice over x86 Linux?
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
Mark
