<EM>&gt; No idea what you have done but the last time I tried  ATI Xpert98

<P>Thanks Michael...    I'm not really sure why my Xpert 98 card won't work on
<BR>
my Alpha...  I'm currently using it on machine running x86/Linux without
<BR>
any problem...  However, no matter what version of the XFree86 Mach64
<BR>
server I've tried, it crashes immediately.  Again, I think it might have to
<BR>
do with the libraries from the pre4.0 release interfering somehow...  I
<BR>
guess I'll find out tonight :-)
