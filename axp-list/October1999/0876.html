<P>
I have to check the actual page where the original drivers come from and see
<BR>
if they have updated ones... yes you are right this is getting
<BR>
rediculous....
<BR>
I went to the Alpha a few days back to play my music on cuz I was getting
<BR>
VERY tired of my slow AMD K6 200MHz NT box. looks like I'll be on it for a
<BR>
while still until this sound card issue is resolved. Unfortunately Linux
<BR>
*STILL* isn't extremely multimedia friendly and by the looks of it, old
<BR>
sound card support is getting worse.
<BR>
2.2.5-22 (the default patched RH one) seems to be fine with sound BUT it has
<BR>
a lot of other problems with it. An x86 server I admin has to be rebooted
<BR>
every 2 weeks because it stops responding to telnet requests. It needs
<BR>
*MAXIMUM* uptime so the CS students at the community college can telnet in
<BR>
and work on their programs.
<BR>
I noticed the same thing on my alpha here with that kernel.
<BR>
<P>I'm thinking it comes down to this:
<BR>
each particular revision of the kernel has it's good and bad points. Some
<BR>
things get better with the newer revisions and other things get worse, and
<BR>
*hopefully* get fixed again. Makes it frustrating to push Linux to a
<BR>
particular company/ college.
<BR>
<P>'just my 2 cents'

<P><P>I still don't get more than 2-3 days without hanging solid after heavy sound
<BR>
usage (playing mame or mp3's).  This is with 2.2.9.  Anything later freezes
<BR>
after a minute of using my SB16 ISA card.  I've also increased stability by
<BR>
building 2.2.9 with gcc-2.7.2.3.  I still don't know what's special about
<BR>
2.2.9
<BR>
when it comes to sound/DMA/Saturn-I/O, but this is getting ridiculous.
