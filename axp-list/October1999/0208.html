Good grief, this looks like an radio transcript :-) 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One thing I haven't found one the web is a detailed description of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kernel bugs and which patches should be applied to fix them.  Maybe
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alpha-specific kernel bugs? For a while there, we were seeing 2-3
<BR>
compile &quot;bugs&quot; per 2.2.x release on the Alpha.  Mostly due to someone
<BR>
using a structure foo in the code's &quot;neutral land&quot; which only had
<BR>
defs in the header files for architecture bar.  There seems to be a dearth
<BR>
of people willing to keep up with the changes and work on the Alpha
<BR>
portions of the kernel.  In recent times, its mainly been Rich Henderson
<BR>
and Jay Estabrook contributing Alpha code.  I kept up with fixes for
<BR>
Alan's -ac and the main kernel for a while, and started up again with
<BR>
2.2.10.  One of the big problems is that folks like Linus and Alan 
<BR>
either don't have the time for or do not want an Alpha system for kernel
<BR>
development.  Several people have offered them free systems; I'm not sure
<BR>
how/if Linus has put that donated DS20 to use.      
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm just not looking in the right place, but short of collating a lot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of stuff from various email archives, I haven't see this info
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; available online.  Since the 2.2 series has been nightmarish (IMHO) on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the alpha, I think a web page summarizing kernel problems and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solutions would be quite helpful.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I laid the foundation for something like this months ago but it
<BR>
never got off the ground.  It was called the... &quot;Alpha Linux Hack Shack&quot;,
<BR>
and would've incorporated a comments section, per-release kernel summary,
<BR>
and an unofficial patches section.  
<BR>
I'll try to dig up the images/html I made for that, and stick that back on
<BR>
the project list.
