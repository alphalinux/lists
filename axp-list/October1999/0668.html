<P><EM>&gt; I disagree. I think that desktop icons can (if implemented correctly) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be very consistent with the UNIX philosophy. I like the way KDE has its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; desktop set up. The desktop is a directory and you can copy files to/from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the desktop like any other directory. Rings of the UNIX maxim &quot;everything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a file&quot; .. I like it. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmmm, I suppose it could look like that.  I generally have little on my
<BR>
desktop because most stuff I start from the CL (which is the UNIX way as
<BR>
far as I am concerned!).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I agree that windows sometimes get in the way, but a full screen window
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hides your root (and thus root menu) too .. its the same fundamental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem. A dock like Afterstep's Wharf can help if it always floats above
</EM><BR>
<P>Not really, you can set windows so they won't cover the dock or icons in
<BR>
full screen mode, not that I use that much anyway.  All you need is a tiny
<BR>
little piece of the root window visible for the menus to work anyway, but
<BR>
with desktop icons you end up shoving stuff about to reveal the
<BR>
appropriate icon and I have never found the process of selecting
<BR>
icons/folders for moving around to be quicker than just jumping in there
<BR>
with the CL so I wouldn't use them anyway.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; apps (I hate that), and a toolbar like KDE's can help since it can limit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effective screen size and make apps occupy less screen area (I hate that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; too).. 
</EM><BR>
<P>True again, but still reminds me too much of the beast that is MS :-)
<BR>
<P>I still stand by WindowMaker for its speed anyway, an Alpha is a terrible
<BR>
thing to waste and WindowMaker doesn't bog the machine down like KDE or
<BR>
Gnome do.  Besides, if people come to Linux and use the KDE or GNOME
<BR>
desktops is it any wonder they feel it is slow compared with Windows?
<BR>
WindowMaker is nippy, good to look at and extremely functional.  If you
<BR>
want you can use GNOME with it but frankly I tried it and dumped it.
<BR>
<P>Still, we haven't solved the browser problem yet, and kfm isn't really
<BR>
much of a substitute for a proper browser.
