<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt;As for SRM licensing, that one has been around the block several times.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The other thing you might want to keep in mind is that Slot-B is not a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Compaq design, and as far as I know Compaq is not using it in any of its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;boxes. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My point exactly, why!?  Slot B is an open standard (Compaq co-developed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it, costs are entirely based on design costs, not licensing).  
</EM><BR>
<P>Where are you getting this info that Compaq co-developed Slot-B, Because
<BR>
to the extent of my knowlegde they did not (and I work for Alpha Processor
<BR>
Inc)?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If Compaq
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't adopt Slot B in ANY of its product offerings, what kind of signal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does that send?  It would be like Mercedes Benze and Bosch co-developing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Disc brakes only to continue to use less efficient drum brakes (which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; didn't happen).  Why develop something for someone else to use and gain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing from it directly?  As for SRM licensing going around several times,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone needs to stop and consider the ramifications of NOT licensing SRM:
</EM><BR>
<P>Well I'm afraid there's little I can do there other than continue voicing
<BR>
my opinions (to anyone that will listen).
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 1) AlphaBIOS died with NT, no more AlphaBIOS
</EM><BR>
Ummm...we'll see.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2) Continuing to ship AlphaBIOS on systems means only Linux can be used
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (with MILO) even though it is inferior to SRM (designed to address UNIX and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; VMS)
</EM><BR>
Not true. Somebody could write a different loader to replace MILO.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3) ARCSBIOS was owned by Deskstation, Deskstation is dead and it was NT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; firmware anyway.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup, not much future for ARCS BIOS.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 4) SRM is a superior firmware (with the only aspect being the lack of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; filesystem support at the firmware level ala ARC/AlphaBIOS) and would make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a nice standard.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's a tough call to make. While I agree that SRM is technically
<BR>
superior (I like it myself), people want Alpha to be a volume player and
<BR>
they want it to be easier to use (and install Linux on) and AlphaBIOS has
<BR>
a much friendlier interface than SRM, especially for people that are new
<BR>
to Alpha.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 5) Not licensing SRM to Slot B vendors KILLS Alpha because the clone market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will never be able to grow without Compaq support and SRM code.
</EM><BR>
<P>I can't agree with that. SRM is one (of many) firmwares out there for the
<BR>
Alpha and I feel Alpha can succeed with or without SRM. Now, when you say
<BR>
'licensing' do you mean for a fee or 'here you can have this and
<BR>
redistibute it for no cost'?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 6) Changing over to OpenBoot firmware will be lenghty, expensive and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; troublesome, the only reason to do this would be to work AROUND Compaq
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mangement, but this is nearly impossible.  No Alpha firmware for the Slot B
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market means, once again NO Alpha.  Where are these commitments we're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hearing about, are we the only ones to see the glaring holes?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; By the way, I've seen conflicting documentation on what SRM stands for, is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; it: System Resource Monitor or System Reference Manual?  The DEC and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Compaq  websites &gt;&gt; have both listed, which is a fellow to believe?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I always heard System Resource Manual, though I can't guarantee it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;right.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; System Resource Manual?  Sounds like yet another permutation of the two
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; definitions, only this one makes even less sense.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sorry, System Refernece Manual....it's been a long day.
