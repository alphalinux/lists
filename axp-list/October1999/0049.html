<P>
I normally do more lurking than posting, but I just had to contribute
<BR>
my $0.02 to this thread.
<BR>
<P>Like many on this list, my disappointment with RatHed grows with each 
<BR>
release, since it seems that more new bugs are introduced each time than
<BR>
are fixed.  As others have said many times on this list, it's clear that 
<BR>
RatHed does little if any testing of their alpha release.  I once sent
<BR>
email to one of their folks, begging them to start some kind of formal
<BR>
beta testing program, but, if they ever did it, it's not working.
<BR>
<P>As a biologist, I tend to see everything in evolutionary terms.  Open
<BR>
source software in general, and Linux in particular, is a self-organizing
<BR>
and evolving system.  The problem with RatHed for the alpha is a lack of
<BR>
selection pressure.  We need a distribution maintained by people who
<BR>
regularly use and depend on alphas, and who respond to bug reports and
<BR>
rapidly incorporate contributed fixes.  From reading Ron Farrer's recent
<BR>
postings, and from perusing the debian website, debian is looking more and
<BR>
more like the most promising (although not perfect) alternative.  I
<BR>
suppose I shouldn't praise debian too much yet, since I've not yet tried
<BR>
it, but I will be doing so in the next few weeks.
<BR>
<P>I have recently been experimenting with the alpha port of FreeBSD. FreeBSD
<BR>
has a lot going for it, including much better virtual memory algorithms
<BR>
than Linux, an NFS implementation that reputedly is second only to Sun's,
<BR>
and a really well-thought-out and relatively painless upgrade system based
<BR>
entirely on make files and a central source code repository (on the net)
<BR>
under CVS control.  In essence, whenever you want to upgrade your system,
<BR>
you type &quot;make update&quot;, and the system fetches only the *changes* to the
<BR>
source code since your last update, and recompiles your system.  There's
<BR>
never any concern about incompatible shared object libraries, etc., and
<BR>
the source code is easily available for when you need to fix or tweak
<BR>
something.  As with Linux, FreeBSD development takes place along 2 tracks,
<BR>
a stable and an experimental.  If you have the stable system, doing a
<BR>
&quot;make update&quot; really just gets you the latest bug fixes, whereas in an
<BR>
experimental system it gets you the latest bleeding edge new features.  
<BR>
As much as I like this approach, I probably won't end up switching to it,
<BR>
since my number crunching needs really benefit from cpml, and I doubt that
<BR>
will be available for FreeBSD.  Another problem is that FreeBSD on the
<BR>
alpha, at least for now, also seems to have insufficient &quot;selection
<BR>
pressure&quot;, just because the community of users is so small.
<BR>
<P>I only mention it as an example of what's possible in the way of
<BR>
&quot;self-organization&quot;.  It would be nice if a consensus could emerge from
<BR>
our group about what distribution is most responsive to the needs of alpha
<BR>
users.  Maybe that's too much to hope for from such a diverse group, but,
<BR>
if it did happen, and if Compaq threw their support in that direction, we
<BR>
might be able spend less time on the kinds of problems that now fill this
<BR>
list, and more on the work for which we originally bought our alphas.
<BR>
<P>JMHO,
<BR>
