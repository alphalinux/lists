<P>
I'll post it again...
<BR>
<P>I'm still having random system freezes related to sound.
<BR>
I have a PC164 with an original SoundBlaster 16 ISA card.
<BR>
I've tried various kernels... 2.2.5, 2.2.7, 2.2.9, 2.2.10, 2.2.12, 2.3.1, 2.3.10
<BR>
and so on.  They all have the same problem.  Most of them freeze the machine 
<BR>
either when I try to play a sound, or soon afterwards.
<BR>
2.2.9 seems to be the most stable for some reason when it comes to sound, that's
<BR>
what I'm running currently.  Though it still hangs, just not as often.
<BR>
I'm using the PNP driver, and the sound drivers compiled as modules.
<BR>
They load up fine, no errors, and sound works flawlessly, except for the
<BR>
random hanging.  I'm using SRM, if that matters, and I've tried both &quot;generic&quot;
<BR>
alpha support, as well as PC164 specific in the General Setup section.
<BR>
Does sound just magically work fine for everyone else with a PC164?
<BR>
Could there be a problem with the Saturn I/O driver?  I don't have any other
<BR>
ISA cards, so I can't compare.  Could it be an ISA DMA problem????
<BR>
<P>Can someone please offer some suggestions?
<BR>
Thanks.
<BR>
