<P>
<EM>&gt;Where are you getting this info that Compaq co-developed Slot-B, Because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to the extent of my knowlegde they did not (and I work for Alpha Processor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Inc)?
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, my understanding is that Digital had the original plans and
<BR>
Samsung (pre API creation) liked the idea enough to run with it.  Samsung
<BR>
and AMD finally agreed upon the specs and created some initial testbeds
<BR>
including the Slot A and Slot B concepts.  
<BR>
<P>This apparently isn't all that important anymore since AMD has publiclly
<BR>
backed away from the Slot B concept that would have made a generic, low
<BR>
cost (many Taiwanese vendors had signed on) motherboard designed for it
<BR>
capable of accepting either a K7 Anthon or a EV6x Alpha.  In theory, all
<BR>
you would need to do is flash the EEPROM with a new firmware and get either
<BR>
an Athon PC BIOS or an Alpha firmware console. As far as volume Alpha sales
<BR>
through Slot B is concerned, AMD has just scuttled it, any new players in
<BR>
the AMD K7 market are going to build for the electrically identical but
<BR>
physically dissimilar Slot A format and another slot as yet unreleased.
<BR>
API is now the sole builder for Slot B systems with apparently no takers on
<BR>
building Slot B boards for the comparitively low volume Alpha business.
<BR>
Strike two for our beloved platform.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;If Compaq
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; doesn't adopt Slot B in ANY of its product offerings, what kind of signal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; does that send?  It would be like Mercedes Benze and Bosch co-developing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Disc brakes only to continue to use less efficient drum brakes (which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; didn't happen).  Why develop something for someone else to use and gain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; nothing from it directly?  As for SRM licensing going around several times,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; someone needs to stop and consider the ramifications of NOT licensing SRM:
</EM><BR>
<P>STRIKE above (I just found out an hour ago), now there isn't much point.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Well I'm afraid there's little I can do there other than continue voicing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;my opinions (to anyone that will listen).
</EM><BR>
<P>And voice them loudly sir, maybe something amazing will happen and this
<BR>
won't be a total disaster after all.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; 1) AlphaBIOS died with NT, no more AlphaBIOS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ummm...we'll see.
</EM><BR>
<P>I just spoke with AlphaBIOS development team leaders at Compaq's DecWest,
<BR>
AlphaBIOS and the code for Windows 2000 Alpha is frozen.  The last version
<BR>
of AlphaBIOS is 5.7, end of story.  About 2 engineers are left to fix
<BR>
problems that might plague the development teams working on 64 bit Windows
<BR>
for Microsoft.  Other than that, it is finished.  If API wants to keep it,
<BR>
it had better buy it now to keep it up to date.  You could rip out the NT
<BR>
boot code and make it more suitable for Linux or BSD UNIX (who have no
<BR>
equiv of MILO).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; 2) Continuing to ship AlphaBIOS on systems means only Linux can be used
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; (with MILO) even though it is inferior to SRM (designed to address UNIX and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; VMS)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Not true. Somebody could write a different loader to replace MILO.
</EM><BR>
Possible, but in about 6 months AlphaBIOS is going to be pretty dated
<BR>
without modification which is going to hold up new board products unless
<BR>
API either buys the AlphaBIOS code and modifies it as they see fit or go
<BR>
with a completely different firmware entirely (homegrown if necessary).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; 3) ARCSBIOS was owned by Deskstation, Deskstation is dead and it was NT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; firmware anyway.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yup, not much future for ARCS BIOS.
</EM><BR>
<P>Deskstation may be in the market to sell of ARCSBIOS if Compaq doesn't play
<BR>
ball.  With the money pains they are in, they may sell for a song.  That at
<BR>
least would be homegrown in a sense since Samsung co-wrote that firmware.
<BR>
I still say an SRM or even a stripped down, graphical SRM would be better
<BR>
for the long term.  Long term thinking is desperately need right now, we
<BR>
are flying blind on this platform with no one providing answers on changing
<BR>
of the guards or migraiton paths (for those invested in NT, finding an OS
<BR>
with comparable tools, applications and services is a tall order, VMS is
<BR>
the obvious one at the high end, Linux at the low). Its a sorry position to
<BR>
be in, but its all up to you (API) to get the ball rolling and Alpha's into
<BR>
the hands of cosumers.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; 4) SRM is a superior firmware (with the only aspect being the lack of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; filesystem support at the firmware level ala ARC/AlphaBIOS) and would make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; a nice standard.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;That's a tough call to make. While I agree that SRM is technically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;superior (I like it myself), people want Alpha to be a volume player and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they want it to be easier to use (and install Linux on) and AlphaBIOS has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a much friendlier interface than SRM, especially for people that are new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<P>Alpha is hardly in a position to be a volume player now that AMD has
<BR>
welched on their end of the deal. The Slot B cartridge concept would have
<BR>
created a huge slew of boards that were &quot;Alpha ready&quot; even if they shipped
<BR>
with an Anthon and a PC BIOS flashed onto their EEPROMs.  This promise is
<BR>
gone, its up to API to figure out something else that can get volume up
<BR>
which leads us (at least in part) back to the firmware crisis:  No new
<BR>
AlphaBIOS and API's currently limited access to the SRM console (which is
<BR>
licensed code that you have to pay for, like a chunk of OS code). Along
<BR>
with this comes the PALcode issue which is a similar stinker on Slot B
<BR>
boards to support the OS.  The PALcode in the existing MILO is based on the
<BR>
oldest samples of PALcode that come from Digital UNIX 3.2 and are samples
<BR>
that come with the EBSDK.  Clearly, this is not a long term solution.
<BR>
Either Compaq cuts a deal on SRM and allows API to modify it as they see
<BR>
fit for their Slot B designs or sell AlphaBIOS for same, either way its up
<BR>
to Compaq and they have not been showing much interest in workstations or
<BR>
the clone market in general.  It may be months before they even figure out
<BR>
they've orphaned you.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; 5) Not licensing SRM to Slot B vendors KILLS Alpha because the clone market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; will never be able to grow without Compaq support and SRM code.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I can't agree with that. SRM is one (of many) firmwares out there for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Alpha and I feel Alpha can succeed with or without SRM. Now, when you say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'licensing' do you mean for a fee or 'here you can have this and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;redistibute it for no cost'?
</EM><BR>
<P>I count only 4 firmware, and 3 of them are for NT (ARC firmware, the
<BR>
oldest, AlphaBIOS the newer window based firmware and ARCSBIOS which was
<BR>
the Deskstation/Samsung orphan found only on the 164UX and 164BX). SRM is
<BR>
the only logical choice for the reasons I have already given.  I just hope
<BR>
that Compaq realizes how important it is for them to license their overly
<BR>
protected firmware and PALcode implementations.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; 6) Changing over to OpenBoot firmware will be lenghty, expensive and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; troublesome, the only reason to do this would be to work AROUND Compaq
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; mangement, but this is nearly impossible.  No Alpha firmware for the Slot B
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; market means, once again NO Alpha.  Where are these commitments we're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; hearing about, are we the only ones to see the glaring holes?
</EM><BR>
<P>I was grasping at straws with this one.  It may still be necessary for API
<BR>
to go OpenBoot if Compaq doesn't play ball and hold out on the firmware
<BR>
code.  You would still need access to their PALcode however, so you're
<BR>
still stuck with Compaq's current management issues for better or worse.
<BR>
The investment will be significant since there will need to be a staff of
<BR>
full time programmers and testing/QC people all the time to keep things
<BR>
updated. Makes you want to tear hair out and I was just starting to get
<BR>
positive about my favorite platform (and bread and butter) again.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Sorry, System Refernece Manual....it's been a long day.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll buy that, but here is a definition guaranteed to confuse anyone who's
<BR>
trying to get Compaq's take on the Linux OS on their hardware:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.digital.com/alphaserver/linux/install_guide.html">http://www.digital.com/alphaserver/linux/install_guide.html</A>
<BR>
<P>Choose the install PDF file for the System Resource Monitor reference
<BR>
(practically every page).
<BR>
<P>Aaron Sakovich and Terry Shannon's (regular posters on the Alph/NT list)
<BR>
take on this is similar to my own that something major has to be done by
<BR>
the customer base of the Alpha platform to finally get some attention and
<BR>
get things done.  I've sent many senior techs questions on how they intend
<BR>
to grow the clone market with API and on its own with no real answers yet.
<BR>
The walls are shaking at Compaq and I don't expect any responses for some
<BR>
time (if at all) on these issues.  
<BR>
<P>If I can render any assistance to API via the work I'm doing now on a
<BR>
handbook, I shall provide it. There are ways of getting what you want,
<BR>
public awareness being one of the more powerful.
<BR>
<P>Lets make some noise, I've lost my shirt already, I'm not losing the
<BR>
trousers too.
