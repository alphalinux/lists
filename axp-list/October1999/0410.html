<EM>&gt; I definitely wouldn't trust 2.2 series kernel built with 2.95.  Someone high

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specifically stated that 2.2 was not coded with 2.95 in mind, and if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insist on using it, it's only a coincidence that it works.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ugh!  I love quotes out of context.  One may learn wondrous things.
<BR>
<P>Concerns you mentioned are based on the fact that gcc-2.95 works
<BR>
somewhat differently with i386 assembler (some would argue that these
<BR>
&quot;features&quot; on which older kernels rely on are outright gcc bugs).  This
<BR>
affects to a greater degree kernels from 2.0 series and, as a matter of
<BR>
fact, many people run i386 compiled with gcc-2.95 (or even with a more
<BR>
aggresive compilers - like pgcc) without any ill effects;  Mandrake
<BR>
distribution is doing something of that kind.  Alan Cox does not like to
<BR>
wonder if some bug reports are caused by changes in a compiler and is is
<BR>
hard to blame him.  Most things which surface are not exactly obvious.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That's not a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; direct quote, but I believe it is the spirit in which it was intended.
</EM><BR>
<P>Now could you explain, please, how this affects Alpha?  BTW - I happen
<BR>
to be running on Alpha kernels compiled with 2.95.1  Recently I run
<BR>
intesive compilation jobs resulting in few hundreds of megabytes of
<BR>
ready binaries without a single hiccup.  My X server, OTOH, goes from
<BR>
time to time catatonic and that one definitely was not compiled with
<BR>
2.95. :-)
<BR>
<P>If you have real bug reports against 2.95 on Alpha (I filed one
<BR>
recently about g++ from 2.95) then,  I am sure, everybody would be
<BR>
interested.
