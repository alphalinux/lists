Tom,
<BR>
<P>I assume you are talking RH 6.0....
<BR>
<P>boot sda1:/boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/sda1
<BR>
<P>should do the trick.
<BR>
The problem is the location of the linux kernel on your filesystem.
<BR>
<P>For future reference, you can view the contents of linux and msdos file
<BR>
systems at the Milo prompt.  Simply use 'ls' and 'cd' like you normally
<BR>
would in a unix environment (except that there are no args like 'ls -al').
<BR>
'ls sda1:' will show you the contents of that filesystem.  'sda1:' by itself
<BR>
will change that parition to be the current one, and then simply 'ls' will
<BR>
list its contents.
<BR>
<P>Also, the Milo 'help' command will list more advanced features.
<BR>

Subject: Damn boot problem-cant boot from hard drive
<BR>
<P><P><P>Okay, after some monkeying around I managed to get redhat to boot from
<BR>
floppy and install. Now I can't get it to boot from hard drive.
<BR>
<P>The Red Hat documentation is flat out wrong. 'boot sda1' most definitely
<BR>
does not work, neither does 'boot floppy' or any of the other suggestions
<BR>
they have.
<BR>
<P>Through experimentation and desperation I tried the following
<BR>
'boot sda1:vmlinux.gz root=/dev/sda1'
<BR>
this resulted
<BR>
<P>Please wait while setting up devices...........
<BR>
Major devices are: fd (0002) sd (0008) sr (000B)
<BR>
MILO: Failed to load the kernel
<BR>
<P>Thats the best result I have gotten so far. I made a small partition to copy
<BR>
MILO to, but I can't boot the system far enough to set MILO and the boot
<BR>
process up permanently for the hard drive.
<BR>
<P>Can someone help me out? I'm a big linux x86 and sparc fan, but from what
<BR>
i've seen so far linux/alpha is pretty poorly put together. This is the
<BR>
poorest excuse of an install procedure I have ever seen.
<BR>
