<P>
I'm having two strange things happen..
<BR>
<P>1) If I modify something in Linuxconf and activate the changes I get an error
<BR>
stating that &quot;/etc/inetd.conf&quot; has a revision date in the future.  This probably
<BR>
means the system time is wrong...  The state of the system is not in sync with
<BR>
the current configuration.  You are allowed to make it current...&quot;
<BR>
<P>My date/time is November 23 when it should be October 23.  How do I fix this?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>2) May be related to above..but probably not.  I am using the standard DEC NIC
<BR>
interface that came with my Alpha 500a Personal Workstation.  I have a valid
<BR>
IP assigned to eth0 (172.16.1.10/16) and it is plugged into a Cisco swtich.
<BR>
&nbsp;I can't ping any other devices on the local segment - and the (green) activity
<BR>
light on the switch is going nuts!  About 30 flashes per second (like a strobe
<BR>
light).  I've tried different Cat 5 cables, I've triple checked that the IP
<BR>
and subnet are accurate, and during bootup Linux successfully brings eth0 to
<BR>
an &quot;up&quot; state.  During installation it detected this card as Tulip - which I'm
<BR>
assuming is right, but I don't know. Are there any known issues?  This is Red
<BR>
Hat 6.0 with Kernel 2.2.5-16.
<BR>
<P>I appreciate any feedback from this list.. I've seriously tried everything to
<BR>
the best of my ability..
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
Mark Holloway
