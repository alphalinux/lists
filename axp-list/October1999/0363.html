<EM>&gt; &gt; Can you borrow a Symbios Logic based card, such as an Intraserver to test

<EM>&gt; &gt; it with?

<EM>&gt; Well, my 164LX still hangs sporadicly, though I'm not sure it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; related to the above problem.  My machine doesn't hang on boot, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; randomly under load. I have *no* further ideas about how to fix or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; debug the problem.

<P>My hang (I have the Adaptec card) is during operation, generally under
<BR>
some sort of load. Once it hangs, though, a soft reboot (by Alt-SysRq-b)
<BR>
leads to MILO hanging. Hence my question about interrupts. The 2.2.12 may
<BR>
well be related, though I'm having a little trouble understanding how that
<BR>
might cause the trouble with the MILO soft reboot.

<P>It is interesting that Greg is having similar symptoms with a largely
<BR>
different system from mine.
