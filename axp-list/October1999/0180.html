[I put axp-list back in the loop, since they are most likely interested in
<BR>
the solutions to some of these problems.]

<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;BTW - the current version of Gnome, although not totally problem free,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Are there any Gnome problems that need fixing,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, definitely. :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Alpha-specific or otherwise?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I do not know about &quot;otherwise&quot; part as I was hacking Gnome only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on Alpha.  Recently I submitted an &quot;official&quot; bug report
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (after a font change from a theme selector in CC the whole X locks up;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a power switch time if you cannot telnet in).
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a bug in either the X font server (xfs) or egcs which manifests
<BR>
itself when xfs is compiled with optimization. As a result of the xfs
<BR>
crash, the X server locks up.
<BR>
<P>The latest XFree86 packages in Rawhide build xfs without optimization on
<BR>
the Alpha.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Recently I was exchanging some e-mail with Miguel de Icaza and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mailed him the whole list of problems of varying degrees of severity.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For example - I can crash an address book from gnome-pim on demand.  
</EM><BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; He asked me to submit all these &quot;officialy&quot;.  Maybe one day if I will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; find some time. This alpha box is not on-line and this is not that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; easy as it sounds.
</EM><BR>
<P>Forgive me if I can't sympathize - I don't experience any obstacles myself
<BR>
in sending an e-mail to the bug system. :)
<BR>
<P>If you have suggestions on making it easier to report bugs, please bring
<BR>
them up on gnome-list. The gnome hackers want to receive as many bug
<BR>
reports as there are bugs...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The other problem which I did not mention anywhere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yet: docs claim that Help Browser should be able to retrieve documents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with URLs like <A HREF="http://somewhere.net/....">http://somewhere.net/....</A>  I am getting **always** that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such document cannot be found.  I did not investigate that closer yet.
</EM><BR>
<P>If those docs exist they are inaccurate and need to be fixed. The XmHTML
<BR>
widget currently used by the help browser can't handle most of the HTML
<BR>
out there, so HTTP was turned off.
<BR>
<P>A better HTML widget (hopefully Mozilla) will be in place for GNOME 2.0.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Help in applications is using &quot;default&quot; URL handler which tries to start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'scrape and nothing else (or at least it is not clear how to modify a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; behaviour of gnome-moz-remote).  This is dumb, to put it mildly.
</EM><BR>
<P>I fixed this before GNOME 1.0.40 (see
<BR>
<A HREF="http://bugs.gnome.org/db/14/149.html">http://bugs.gnome.org/db/14/149.html</A>).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; On the top of it 'gmc' tries to retrieve broken URLs for help.
</EM><BR>
<P>Need more info. If it's saying &quot;can't find help file&quot; it may be because
<BR>
you don't have the user's guide installed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In general various headears are skipped
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and one does not get prototypes for various string functions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ('memcpy') or 'alloca' and things like that. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I've not seen these. gnome-libs and gnome-core compile pretty much
<BR>
warning-free with -Wall. There are also some warnings that are correctly
<BR>
left unfixed (e.g. in the code generated by orbit-idl, &quot;uninitialized
<BR>
variable&quot; stuff).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Even with that fixed there is way too much casts between ints and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pointers.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Most of these are probably just lazy programming and harmless (&quot;lets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; store this int value in a pointer and retrieve that later&quot;) but a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; noise they create makes hard to find real bugs of that sort.
</EM><BR>
<P>I haven't seen any 64-bitness problems in Gnome itself. Storing ints in
<BR>
pointers is done using a specific set of macros that avoid warnings, and
<BR>
storing pointers in ints gets fixed quickly, seeing as at least a few of
<BR>
the developers (e.g. panel author) use an Alpha.
<BR>
<P>Please make sure you're using the latest Gnome stuff from ftp.gnome.org -
<BR>
at least one of the problems you mention has long been fixed, so odds are
<BR>
the other fixes have been made as well.
<BR>

The first thing a programmer needs to admit is that any program is by far
<BR>
more complex than his own mind. Thats why he partitions it into neat
<BR>
pieces and avoids complexity.
