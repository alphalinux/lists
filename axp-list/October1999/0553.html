<EM>&gt; &gt; Is any way you can set your backup device and/or controller to an

<EM>&gt; &gt; async operation?  That would be worth to try.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not sure what that means. I have an ext2 filesystem on the PD disk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that I mount, and the dump goes into a file on that file system.
</EM><BR>
<P>This has nothing to do with a file system but with a way how a device
<BR>
operates on SCSI bus.  Here are quoutes from README.ncr53c8xx but
<BR>
this applies to any SCSI controller and device even if details of
<BR>
configuring it may differ.  Spelling of the original. :-)
<BR>
<P>&lt;quote&gt;
<BR>
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_SYNC            (default answer: 5)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This option allows you to specify the frequency in MHz the driver 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will use at boot time for synchronous data transfer negotiations.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This frequency can be changed later with the &quot;setsync&quot; control command.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 means &quot;asynchronous data transfers&quot;
<BR>
.....
<BR>
10.2.7  Default synchronous period factor
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sync:255     disabled (asynchronous transfer mode)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sync:#factor
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;#factor = 10     Ultra-2 SCSI 40 Mega-transfers / second
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;#factor = 11     Ultra-2 SCSI 33 Mega-transfers / second
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;#factor &lt; 25     Ultra   SCSI 20 Mega-transfers / second
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;#factor &lt; 50     Fast    SCSI-2
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In all cases, the driver will use the minimum transfer period supported by 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;controllers according to NCR53C8XX chip type.
<BR>

Most SCSI problems are due to a non conformant SCSI bus or to buggy
<BR>
devices.  If infortunately you have SCSI problems, you can check the
<BR>
following things:
<BR>
<P>- SCSI bus cables
<BR>
- terminations at both end of the SCSI chain
<BR>
- linux syslog messages (some of them may help you)
<BR>
<P>If you donnot find the source of problems, you can configure the
<BR>
driver with no features enabled.
<BR>
<P>- only asynchronous data transfers
<BR>
- tagged commands disabled
<BR>
- disconnections not allowed
<BR>
<P>Now, if your SCSI bus is ok, your system have every chance to work
<BR>
with this safe configuration but performances will not be optimal.
<BR>
&lt;/quote&gt;
<BR>
<P>For example, if your backup device claims that it can disconnect
<BR>
(controller asks) but it is not doing that properly then it may
<BR>
hang SCSI bus and your computer is dead.  You will not see any
<BR>
messages logged in such case as they would have to go to disks through
<BR>
this very bus which just went south.  Maybe if you are logging
<BR>
outside through a serial port before everything comes to a grinding
<BR>
halt...?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There is a temptation to stop doing backups on it. If I get another hang
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at the same place, then I will try not using it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ahem...
