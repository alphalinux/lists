<P>
<EM>&gt; (excluding things like Netscape on the Alpha), the same interface and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; configuration methods, etc.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreed - consistency across platforms is a definate plus.    
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Ironically (given what was in the previous post about Redhat not being very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gung-ho on the Alpha port), it was the Alpha port of Redhat that got me to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; switch my Intel boxes from Slackware.  So if they'd not put out an Alpha port,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I probably would have never bought any RH in the first place.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good point, and I fall into the same category.  Prior to buying
<BR>
the Alphas, SLS and Slackware had been the sum total of my Linux
<BR>
experience.  I guess coming from an Ultrix/SunOS background, the BSD
<BR>
&quot;feel&quot; of Slackware was more comfortable than the SysV-ish RedHat.  That
<BR>
and reports of very nasty bugs (in 2.1 and 3.0.3 esp.) kept RH at a
<BR>
distance from my desktop.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I was getting at in the last post was not really 
<BR>
&quot;Should we build a better distro because none are perfect?&quot;, but rather 
<BR>
an underlying theme that accompanies it: self-sustainment vs. adaptation.  
<BR>
Should AlphaLinux focus on very specific niches where it historically fits 
<BR>
in well, or continue in an attempt to be 'all things to all users', 
<BR>
covering every market that Linux/x86 targets?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are definate advantages of AlphaLinux which 'sell'
<BR>
themselves to certain market segments without any effort on the side of
<BR>
marketing.  For the hardcore number crunching demanded by grand challenge
<BR>
problems, massive renderfarms, weather forecasting (again, kudos to
<BR>
HPTi!) and simulations, a cluster of AlphaLinux boxes cannot be beat. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other areas where it's unclear how or if AlphaLinux
<BR>
should fit in.  For example, how should we respond to a video game 
<BR>
company which wants to port their product to AlphaLinux but &quot;needs&quot; AGP
<BR>
support when there is none? Should they be given more or less
<BR>
consideration than a company which wants to bring their scientific/server
<BR>
application to AlphaLinux? These issues are very real, and ones which I
<BR>
know have faced ALO (and other Linux advocacy groups) in the past. 
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
