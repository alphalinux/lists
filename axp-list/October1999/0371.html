Looks like good karma for the future of the alpha platform.  If only the
<BR>
prices were more reasonable on this new stuff....

<P>-- The irony is that Bill Gates claims to be making a stable operating
<BR>
system and Linus Torvaldis claims to be trying to take over the world...

<P><P>Compaq announced its upcoming EV8 Alpha chip, which will run at speeds of
<BR>
1.2 to 2 GHz.  This chip will go in a different direction than either IBM or
<BR>
AMD -- instead of trying to put 2 CPUs on the same chip, the EV8 will use a
<BR>
method called symmetric multithreading, which allows multiple instructions
<BR>
to execute at the same time.  According to a Compaq spokesman, this new
<BR>
technique only adds 5 percent to the area of the chip, while doubling
<BR>
performance.  (Note that per a recent Compaq announcement, future versions
<BR>
of Windows, including Windows 2000, will not be supported on the Alpha
<BR>
chip).
