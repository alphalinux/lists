<EM>&gt; &gt; SRM is licensed and Compaq wants the money to use it.  If SRM was more of

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As a standard, SRM is reasonably open - it's described in the Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Architecture Reference Manual available from bookstores.  What is really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bad is the highly restricted availability of the bits which can't be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; built independently.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup.  I have been checking internally and someone pointed out to me the fact
<BR>
that, off of the AlphaOEM section of www.digital.com, there is a link to an
<BR>
orderable part number for the DP264 SRM SDK.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Take the PALcode, for example.  I really don't understand why it's not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; available.  PALcode is basically what other processor manufacturers put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into their chips!  I know it was a good idea to move it into general
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purpose RAM - flexibility and stuff, but well, can we the processor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; users please have it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My understanding is that Digital assumed nobody would need an Alpha CPU
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without one of Digital-supported operating systems: Open VMS, Digital
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; UNIX, or Windows NT.  Their attitude towards firmware and PALcode has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; made Alpha CPUs actually unusable without one of those OSes - the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; situation I believe no other processor has ever been in before.  They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (other processors) can all be usefully programmed in machine codes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using just the architecture specification.  The Alpha can't - unless you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to dive into nitty-gritty details of a particular implementation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>How did the milo/aboot folks get everything going?  I'm being serious - I came
<BR>
into the Alpha game way after most of that had been sorted out, I believe.
<BR>
Either (then) Digital slipped someone a CD and said &quot;shh...don't tell anyone&quot;
<BR>
or someone managed to use the PAL from the SDK.  Or something else that I
<BR>
don't know about. ??
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not even asking for the full SRM source code (though it would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really great if it could be made available).  All I'm asking is that all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; platform specific code (initialisation, PALcode) be provided with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hardware systems so their users can run whatever they want.  There is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no logic in holding on to it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>You'd be amazed at what seems like logic depending on who you ask what
<BR>
question.  I'm trying to track down the responsible people for this internally
<BR>
so we can get a final &quot;yes/no/gimme a week&quot; answer to all this.  Rest assured
<BR>
that above all else there are lots of people in Compaq that want what's best
<BR>
for Linux/Alpha - we're just trying to move it along a path that won't get
<BR>
us/Compaq in trouble down the road.
