<EM>&gt;         I've no real comments on the system after that.  I did note that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;supplied&quot; SMP kernel did not play nice with my Tulip based Ethernet/SCSI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; device, but I was able to build a new kernel with Tulip &amp; DHCP support and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it came up immediately.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         I'd welcome comments, and encourage each of you to load a DS10/20 at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your leisure!
</EM><BR>
<P>At least you managed to get it working.

<P>Permedia2 cards should work. Haven't used one other
<BR>
than an Elsa Gloria Synergy in my XP1000 for Alphas.
<BR>
I've used them in Intels without troubles.
<BR>
<P>I built 4 DS10's in about 4 hours after updating the
<BR>
install images to correctly handle the SCSI and Tulip
<BR>
chips that came with them. Used S3 Trio64 video though
<BR>
since they were cheap. ($25 each) That included configuring
<BR>
all my network stuff so the systems could see my other 
<BR>
15 machines and misc. stuff. Other folks I'm sure have
<BR>
cloned systems and installed many more faster than
<BR>
that. Most of the time was spent in the boot cycle where
<BR>
SRM was bringing up/down the Enet connections. That
<BR>
takes way too long.
<BR>
<P>The real issue it seems is getting a kernel that works
<BR>
with those system configs.
