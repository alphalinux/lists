<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; SRM is licensed and Compaq wants the money to use it.  If SRM was more
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; an open standard life would be grand.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; As a standard, SRM is reasonably open - it's described in the Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Architecture Reference Manual available from bookstores.  What is really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; bad is the highly restricted availability of the bits which can't be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; built independently.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yup.  I have been checking internally and someone pointed out to me the
</EM><BR>
fact
<BR>
<EM>&gt;that, off of the AlphaOEM section of www.digital.com, there is a link to an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;orderable part number for the DP264 SRM SDK.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I understand it the major benefit of SRM over ARCBIOS is that it 
<BR>
provides a PALcode image, and that milo is required to provide the
<BR>
PALcode when ARCBIOS is used.   
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Take the PALcode, for example.  I really don't understand why it's not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; available.  PALcode is basically what other processor manufacturers put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; into their chips!  I know it was a good idea to move it into general
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; purpose RAM - flexibility and stuff, but well, can we the processor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; users please have it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; My understanding is that Digital assumed nobody would need an Alpha CPU
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; without one of Digital-supported operating systems: Open VMS, Digital
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; UNIX, or Windows NT.  Their attitude towards firmware and PALcode has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; made Alpha CPUs actually unusable without one of those OSes - the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; situation I believe no other processor has ever been in before.  They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; (other processors) can all be usefully programmed in machine codes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; using just the architecture specification.  The Alpha can't - unless you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; want to dive into nitty-gritty details of a particular implementation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;How did the milo/aboot folks get everything going?  I'm being serious - I
</EM><BR>
came
<BR>
<EM>&gt;into the Alpha game way after most of that had been sorted out, I believe.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Either (then) Digital slipped someone a CD and said &quot;shh...don't tell
</EM><BR>
anyone&quot;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;or someone managed to use the PAL from the SDK.  Or something else that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't know about. ??
</EM><BR>
<P>The milo PALcode looks like it was obtained from the old Evaluation
<BR>
Board SDK.  This is now called the Compaq Alpha Motherboard SDK.  I
<BR>
got version 4.0 last May from Dick Kreischer, (Dick.Kreischer@compaq.com).
<BR>
It contains modifiable and redistributable source for Debug Monitor 
<BR>
firmware for the 164LX, 164SX, and 264DP.  This includes SROM code and 
<BR>
PALcode source.  The PALcode is not the same as that used by SRM but it
<BR>
may be okay for linux.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; I'm not even asking for the full SRM source code (though it would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; really great if it could be made available).  All I'm asking is that all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; platform specific code (initialisation, PALcode) be provided with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; hardware systems so their users can run whatever they want.  There is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; no logic in holding on to it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You'd be amazed at what seems like logic depending on who you ask what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;question.  I'm trying to track down the responsible people for this
</EM><BR>
internally
<BR>
<EM>&gt;so we can get a final &quot;yes/no/gimme a week&quot; answer to all this.  Rest
</EM><BR>
assured
<BR>
<EM>&gt;that above all else there are lots of people in Compaq that want what's
</EM><BR>
best
<BR>
<EM>&gt;for Linux/Alpha - we're just trying to move it along a path that won't get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;us/Compaq in trouble down the road.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Getting the low level SDK's for alpha is like pulling teeth.  Nobody seems
<BR>
to know what they are or what is on them.  The last two updates I got were
<BR>
on CDR disks and one had a hand written label.  For what it's worth,
<BR>
I have heard that API may someday release a modified version for their UP 
<BR>
motherboards.
