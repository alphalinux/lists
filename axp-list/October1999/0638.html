<P>Define &quot;better&quot;.

<P>The first and foremost obstable for using DU stuff on Linux is a
<BR>
possible lack of a license for required libriaries and their loader
<BR>
**for a CPU on which you intend to use these things**; otherwise you
<BR>
would be doing that illegally.  Various folks actually have such
<BR>
licenses aquired in different ways.
<BR>
<P>As for Netscape over em86 startup times are of such order that they
<BR>
can put you to sleep.  Once it started it is not bad if you are using
<BR>
version 3.x of Netscape (it has to be compiled for libc5).  When I
<BR>
tried some variants of 4.x they did run but they were definitely on
<BR>
a big fat and slow pig side.  Also you should turn OFF Java and Java
<BR>
Script or 'scrape will be crashing all the time.  The last thing
<BR>
can be construed as a feature. :-)
<BR>
<P>If you insists on using glibc2.1 then em86 does not work, so far, 
<BR>
with it.  Leslie Donaldson was looking at that but he run into
<BR>
problems - rather lack of an information and access to some things
<BR>
than truly technical obstacles.  Also 'math-emu' stuff in all kernels
<BR>
above 2.2.11 kills em86.  Jim Paradis, who modified math-emu, promissed
<BR>
to look at this and I do not know what happened.  A workaround is to
<BR>
take a contents of 'math-emu' directory from 2.2.11 and replaced with
<BR>
it the same thing from, say, 2.2.13 and recompile your kernel.
<BR>
This works fine.
<BR>
<P>Other than that there is nothing special to running Netscape. :-)
<BR>
It works.
