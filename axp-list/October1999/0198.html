Greetings,
<BR>
<P>I've recently started trying to get an old AlphaPC64 board that I own
<BR>
up and running. I've had the machine for a while but a lack of time
<BR>
and equipment forced me to shelve the project for a few months.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, when I was initially playing with it, I remember at some point
<BR>
running the SRM console on it. Since then I've flashed in MILO, which,
<BR>
as I recall, over-wrote the spot that SRM occupied in flash.
<BR>
<P>Now, I'd like to switch back to the SRM console so that I can net-boot
<BR>
the machine (and because I prefer SRM, in general). But, it's
<BR>
definitely not on my flash-rom anymore, and I've been un-able to
<BR>
locate an SRM firmware image for the Cabriolet/AlphaPC64/EB64+ on any
<BR>
of the various Compaq/DEC sites (including
<BR>
<A HREF="http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/">http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/</A>).
<BR>
<P>Does anyone have any ideas where I could find the firmware image? Am I
<BR>
just missing it on the Digital firmware site? Is it filed under a
<BR>
different name? Does such a beast even exist anymore?
<BR>
<P>Any assistance you could provide would be greatly appreciated.
<BR>
<P><PRE>
