<P>As a standard, SRM is reasonably open - it's described in the Alpha
<BR>
Architecture Reference Manual available from bookstores.  What is really
<BR>
bad is the highly restricted availability of the bits which can't be
<BR>
built independently.
<BR>
<P>Take the PALcode, for example.  I really don't understand why it's not
<BR>
available.  PALcode is basically what other processor manufacturers put
<BR>
into their chips!  I know it was a good idea to move it into general
<BR>
purpose RAM - flexibility and stuff, but well, can we the processor
<BR>
users please have it?  
<BR>
<P>My understanding is that Digital assumed nobody would need an Alpha CPU
<BR>
without one of Digital-supported operating systems: Open VMS, Digital
<BR>
UNIX, or Windows NT.  Their attitude towards firmware and PALcode has
<BR>
made Alpha CPUs actually unusable without one of those OSes - the
<BR>
situation I believe no other processor has ever been in before.  They
<BR>
(other processors) can all be usefully programmed in machine codes,
<BR>
using just the architecture specification.  The Alpha can't - unless you
<BR>
want to dive into nitty-gritty details of a particular implementation.
<BR>
<P>I'm not even asking for the full SRM source code (though it would be
<BR>
really great if it could be made available).  All I'm asking is that all
<BR>
platform specific code (initialisation, PALcode) be provided with the
<BR>
hardware systems so their users can run whatever they want.  There is
<BR>
no logic in holding on to it.
