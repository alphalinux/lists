Greetings...
<BR>
I have a PC164, and I've found that my SB16 ISA sound card will randomly
<BR>
freeze my machine solid, usually when the system is busy and I try to play
<BR>
an mp3, for example.  I've tried the stock kernel that comes with redhat 6.0,
<BR>
as well as the 2.2.5-22 update.  I've also built 2.2.12, and in addition tried
<BR>
2.2.13pre1 and 2.2.13pre18.  All have the problem.
<BR>
This is driving me crazy.  Sometimes sounds will play ok, then the machine
<BR>
will freeze some minutes after, but it always happens.
<BR>
If I pull the sound card from the machine, it will stay up nearly indefinitely.
<BR>
I've noticed other people on this list having problems with sound hanging their
<BR>
machine, but I've been unable to find any clear solution.
<BR>
I've built kernels with generic cpu support, with PC164 specific support,
<BR>
with SRM PCI settings enabled (I'm using SRM), with PCI quirks enabled, with
<BR>
PCI bridge optimization enabled.  All these options both on and off, yet they
<BR>
seem to have no effect on the problem.
<BR>
<P>What can I do?  I know there's nothing wrong with my machine or the sound card,
<BR>
as I also have NetBSD on the same machine and it doesn't suffer from this
<BR>
problem.
<BR>
<P>Please help!
<BR>
Thanks,
<BR>
