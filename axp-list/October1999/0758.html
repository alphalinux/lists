<P><EM>&gt; The problem with this as well as with other drives in the range at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or above 9GB is that they are all UltraSCSI, and many come with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wider connector. There are SCA -&gt; SCSI interface adaptors that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reduce the connector width back to 50 pins, but I am not sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whether they would work on the alpha's.
</EM><BR>
<P>They work fine.  I have a pair of Quantum Viking 2GB drives and a
<BR>
Quantum Atlas II 9GB drive, and will soon have an Atlas III 9GB drive,
<BR>
all of which are SCA drives and are connected to my as200 using
<BR>
the adapters you mention.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Furthermore, the UltraSCSI drives are spec'ed at 20 or 40 MB/s which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is more than my current NCR53C-810 controller will yield.
</EM><BR>
<P>In that case, the controller will be the bottleneck, and you will see no
<BR>
more than 10MB/sec (actually more like 8-9MB/sec).  If that will be an
<BR>
issue, you should look into getting additional controllers.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; My questions at this points therefore are:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1. Would it be possible to get an UltraSCSI drive to work with a SCSI-2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    controller on the AlphaStations, possibly with the interface adaptor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    that reduces the connector to 50 pin? Has anyone done this in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    past successfully? I realize that there would be an obvious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    degrading in speed from the specs. I am also wondering whether the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    old SCSI-2 adaptor will actually be able to handle harddrives larger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    than 8GB.
</EM><BR>
<P>Size is independent of bus speed.  Also, I think you may be confusing
<BR>
some of the terminology (as complicated as SCSI terminology is, that's
<BR>
very easy to do :-) ).  Others here I'm sure can illustrate better than
<BR>
I, and hopefully they'll correct me.  UltraSCSI is not the same as SCA.
<BR>
SCA stands for Single Connector Attachment and includes both power and
<BR>
data, having been designed for hot-swap.  
<BR>
<P>Ultra SCSI is basically SCSI-2 renegotiated at twice the speed (20MB/sec
<BR>
instead of 10).  There's actually a lot more to it than that, but to you
<BR>
and I that's pretty much all that matters.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2. Would it be possible to add the UltraSCSI drive as a second drive to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    the machine by getting a PCI bus SCSI controller?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes. In fact, if you install an LVD (80MB/sec) or UltraWide (40MB/sec)
<BR>
controller, you will be able to put several drives on one controller.
<BR>
<P>Actually, I would relegate the on board controller to only handling slow
<BR>
devices such as cdrom and tape drives, and use the new controller for
<BR>
hard disks.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    This way I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    keep the old controller on the motherboard hooked up to the original
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    1GB Quantum HD and plug the IBM HD in to a new SCSI controller on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    PCI bus. This might be the better solution since it seems to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    preserve the speed. Would it be possible to boot off the new disk at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    all? Following Kirk Erichsen's and Paul Bunn's suggestions I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    looking at the Symbios 22915 PCI-&gt;Ultra3 adapter or its little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    brother, the SYM8951U. Is there anything that looks questionable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    with this plan of action?
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds like a good plan to me.
