<P><EM>&gt; Wow 1.5 hrs to compile.  Why is Mozilla so huge?  20Meg download and

<EM>&gt; 713Meg to build.  At least kmail and kfm works for me :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anyway was this your error or is this a different one? 
</EM><BR>
<P>It takes that much space to build Mozilla these days?  Yet another reason for
<BR>
me to avoid even trying - I only have half a gig free.  I don't recall the
<BR>
older (pre seamonkey) releases taking quite that much space to build.  Even the
<BR>
first couple of builds didn't seem to take that much space (I stopped around M5
<BR>
as HD space became *really* tight and I needed the CPU time for real work).
<BR>
<P>At least I can run xfmail locally for mail and run Ye Olde 100898 Mozilla for
<BR>
casual browsing - or ssh to the Sun for use of real Netscape.
<BR>
<P>A *fast* reasonably functional graphical browser would be welcome, though...
<BR>
<P>And unfortunately, I don't have a DU/Tru64 license ... :/
