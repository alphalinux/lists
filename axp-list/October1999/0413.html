<EM>&gt; If you check out www.linux.org.uk and see the release
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; notes for 2.2.12, Alan Cox states not to use gcc
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.95.x for the 2.2 kernels *on x86* ... I have no clue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if it also applies to Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<P>Seeing as this is an object of contention, my point simply is this:  if
<BR>
you have a problem, and you have something different in your
<BR>
configuration from the broader installed base (almost an oxymoron in the
<BR>
Alpha world, but still...) that is removeable, remove it before you send
<BR>
all of us off on a wild goose chase.  In this case, I have seen several
<BR>
wierd results in the 2.2 series _regardless of architecture_ with 2.95,
<BR>
as well as in userspace.  If changing it is not good enough for you,
<BR>
don't shoot the messenger for suggesting your altered configuration
<BR>
could be a problem (be it fact or not).
<BR>
<P>OBreality:  Replies like the one to which I am responding are in fact
<BR>
useful.  Replies like some others which take great pains to sever one's
<BR>
head, are less than useful AT BEST.  I know everyone has bad days (like
<BR>
me today) but don't snipe someone's head off for making a guess and
<BR>
trying to be helpful.  IMO, it's better to try and be wrong than to sit
<BR>
on your hands with your config that &quot;works&quot; and not help at all.  I am
<BR>
currently trying to debug more major problems than I can even count
<BR>
(like QLogic cards being totally busted on Alpha in 2.3 &gt; 12); probably
<BR>
why I misread what Alan was talking about.
<BR>
<P>All that said, I believe this was a problem with a PC164 - way back at
<BR>
the beginning, no?  I currently have mine running 2.2.12ext3 (about to
<BR>
be ext3a) without any hiccups for days, and before that at 2.2.12
<BR>
without hiccups for weeks.  Can the originator of this thread compare
<BR>
current notes, and we'll see what we're up against here?
