Well, I have to get back at Tom for this one...
<BR>
<P>The details I unveiled are from my &quot;Alpha - The E-Commerce Platform For The
<BR>
Next Century&quot; presentation at DECUS Singapore, vetted, approved and
<BR>
supported by Compaq! In fact, Alpha leaders at high level such as Jesse
<BR>
Lipcon and Don Harbert from Compaq, supplied a lot of the data and approved
<BR>
the final public presentation - every bit of it. In contrast, API guys who
<BR>
were asked to provide input didn't do any after repeated requests for a
<BR>
month - you judge for yourselves...
<BR>
<P>And yes, I'm willing to put up a copy of this highly technical and praised
<BR>
presentation on the Redhat list or if anyone wants it.
<BR>
<P>My dear Tom, let me tell you something as one of larger API (but now soon
<BR>
Compaq) customers in Asia-Pacific: what you should worry about is LACK OF
<BR>
ROADMAP AND STRATEGY in your own backyard. Please tell us what board
<BR>
products are coming after UP2000 in Year 2000 from API, something that
<BR>
should finally have faster (not slower) performance and feature set than
<BR>
venerable DP264 and proper official SRM support. I know the answer, and it
<BR>
makes me worried for API...
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, everyone should watch out for an impressive range of new
<BR>
Compaq Alpha system offerings in yr 2000. Of course those are under NDA :-)

<EM>&gt;This level of detail typically only comes, directly or indirectly, from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;non-disclosure presentations,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so called because those receiving the information sign a legal agreement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;promising not to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disclose it.  The indirect sources are the rags like The Register who troll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for tidbits leaked to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them and then invent enough stuff of their own to fill in what's missing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The problem is that there's never any way to tell what the quality of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;information is.  The 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;person you're listening to might have heard it directly from the source last
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;week, or they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;might have heard it from someone who heard it from someone who heard it from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;someone...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It's easy to find instances of information that's been distorted beyond
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;recognition by this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;game of &quot;telephone&quot; or which, while accurate at one point, has since been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;out dated by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;changing plans.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Of course, those who are really &quot;in the know&quot; don't talk in public because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;know that when the next round of proprietary information is distributed,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;those who didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;respect their agreements for the last round won't be included.

<EM>&gt;P.S. SPEC also has some very specific rules for product availability, etc,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which are to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be followed when publishing results using their benchmarks (whether or not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;listed on the SPEC web site).  It would be interesting to know whether he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;followed those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rules for the results he quotes.
