<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am having an odd problem with an IBM 2GB Fast SCSI disk on my
<BR>
XL366 alpha. This disk is being used as a system disk and is connected to
<BR>
the onboard NCR53C810 controller. The system is running Debian 2.1 and
<BR>
kernel 2.2.7. The disk in question is detected as below:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Vendor: IBM       Model: DORS-32160        Rev: WA6A
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 01 CCS
<BR>
<P>Yea, I know that '01 CCS' does not look all that great, but the disk
<BR>
is listed as a Fast SCSI-2 disk by IBM.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously, I had been using the NCR53C7xx,8xx driver in the
<BR>
kernel to support the onboard scsi channel. Under this setup, the disk in
<BR>
question is detected with no problems and can be used with no timeouts or
<BR>
other nasties. The kernel gives me this on boot up:
<BR>
<P>scsi1 : target 1 accepting period 100ns offset 8 10.00MHz FAST SCSI-II 
<BR>
scsi1 : setting target 1 to period 100ns offset 8 10.00MHz FAST SCSI-II 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vendor: IBM       Model: DORS-32160        Rev: WA6A 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 01 CCS 
<BR>
Detected scsi disk sdg at scsi1, channel 0, id 1, lun 0 
<BR>
...
<BR>
SCSI device sdg: hdwr sector= 512 bytes. Sectors= 4127761 [2015 MB] [2.0 GB] 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday I installed two Tekram 390 scsi cards and thereby
<BR>
switched to the NCR53C8xx driver for all controllers (as recommended by
<BR>
the axp-list archives and the kernel help messages). I recompiled a 2.2.7
<BR>
kernel with this change and proceeded to boot the sytem. All disks are
<BR>
correctly detected on all chains, and this is what the kernel tells me
<BR>
about the disk in question:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vendor: IBM       Model: DORS-32160        Rev: WA6A 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 01 CCS 
<BR>
Detected scsi disk sda at scsi0, channel 0, id 1, lun 0 
<BR>
...
<BR>
ncr53c810a-0-&lt;1,*&gt;: FAST-10 SCSI 10.0 MB/s (100 ns, offset 8) 
<BR>
SCSI device sdb: hdwr sector= 512 bytes. Sectors= 4127761 [2015 MB] [2.0 GB]
<BR>
<P>Only, when the system goes to get partition maps for the disks and then
<BR>
later load init off of this disk (since it is the system disk), I start
<BR>
getting SCSI timeouts on this disk for the onboard scsi chain. It recovers
<BR>
from the reset, prints the same SCSI speed detection messages, and then
<BR>
tries again, only to get stuck and reset due to timeouts again, slowly but
<BR>
painfully making progress in the boot up. Basically, the system will not
<BR>
boot.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeated the above test with 2.2.5 and 2.2.12, same
<BR>
configurations, same problem.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I booted with the Debian 2.1 boot floppy's kernel, 2.0.36,
<BR>
and things were quite different. This is what the kenel told me about the
<BR>
disk:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vendor: IBM       Model: DORS-32160        Rev: WA6A 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 01 CCS 
<BR>
Detected scsi disk sda at scsi0, channel 0, id 1, lun 0 
<BR>
...
<BR>
ncr53c810a-0-&lt;1,*&gt;: SYNC transfers not supported. 
<BR>
SCSI device sda: hdwr sector= 512 bytes. Sectors= 4127761 [2015 MB] [2.0 GB]
<BR>
<P>Then the system boots just fine, and there are no SCSI timeouts, and all
<BR>
disks on all controllers are visable. I can then proceed to stress test
<BR>
(i.e. bonnie -s 500) on all disks, compile kernels, etc... with not even a
<BR>
single scsi reset. I get decent speed from my fast and ultra disks on the
<BR>
Tekram controllers, but a rather poor 3.7 MB/sec from the disk in
<BR>
question.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as far as I can determine, this is a software problem, or at
<BR>
the very least is not a scsi cable/termination issue. On the same chain as
<BR>
the disk in question are an Exabyte tape drive (ext), two Toshiba CD-ROMs,
<BR>
and a Yamaha CD-R (which 2.0.36 does not detect or support very well,
<BR>
works fine with 2.2.7). This scsi chain is unchanged from before adding
<BR>
the two Tekram cards. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that for some reason, while the NCR53C7xx,8xx drivers,
<BR>
the onboard SCSI controller, and the IBM SCSI disk all worked together
<BR>
well in the 2.2.7 kernels, synchronous support and all... Going to the
<BR>
NCR53C8xx drivers, with out changing anything else causes some serious
<BR>
heartburn in the system. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this problem?
<BR>
I would very much like to escape from the 2.0.x kernels and go back to the
<BR>
2.2.x kernels, if only for the sake of my CD-R drive. If I could even just
<BR>
tell the IBM drive to not use sync at all in 2.2.x kernels, I would be
<BR>
happy. So, would someone out there please give me some advice on this
<BR>
problem? Thanks in advance!
