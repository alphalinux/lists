<EM>&gt; It also seems less likely if I

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (not X) I sometimes get dumped back into SRM.  It says &quot;exit code 7.  Machine

<P>This is perhaps a strong clue. Maybe you have a HW problem.
<BR>
One would assume a machine check is HW related but I don't
<BR>
have any docs to indicate what they mean. Finding that info
<BR>
might be of help.

<P><EM>&gt; Hardware: 164LX2/533MHz.  Elsa GLoria Synergy 8MB (Permedia2).  4GB Segate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (ST34321A) IDE disk.  Built in CMD646 controller.  Booting through SRM/aboot.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have tried moving my hard drive and video card to another identical machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and had the same problems.  I've also tried using an S3 Virge Trio64 card with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the same behavior.  This seems to be independant of which kernel version I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; running.  I've tried 2.0.36 and 2.2.[7-12].  Currently I'm running
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.2.13pre14, and it's been up for four days...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm at a loss.  I know other people are running on similar hardware.  We have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3 other machines like this one and 16 164LX4/600's which are headless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Beowulf).  I have also had these machines lock up on me, and I expect it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the same problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, does anyone have any help to offer?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>How about swapping memory DIMM's around? Looks like you've swapped
<BR>
about everything but that.
<BR>
<P>I have a 164LX/533 with 256MB memory, ATI Rage II video, 
<BR>
a 2GB Seagate ide disk, ide cdrom, 2 symbios 810 controllers 
<BR>
with a 9GB IBM disk, a DLT7000, and an Exabyte Eliant attached 
<BR>
that hasn't gone down without my taking it down this year. 
<BR>
Currently up 81 days. Running RH6.0's kernel off their CD.
