<EM>&gt;Hi Kirk,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    I have seen the writing  on the wall and it says &quot;Telecom&quot;.  I moved to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a little company in the guts of the telecommunications protocol business
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;called Adax Inc (Berkeley California, where I live)   I moved them to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;StrongArm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;while I was in the OEM Division and they decided I knew something.  I saw an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;opportunity to learn the structure of the backbone of international
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;telecommunications.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I began last Monday. (and went for discussions at the worlds largest telecom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;equipment manufacturer on Tuesday)   My book is still open because of some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;issues which one often encounters in intimate little companies, but,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with a degree in Mathematics, I like the protocol business (Frame relay,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ATM, GSM, 3G, ...).   The future for telecom is fascinating.
</EM><BR>
<P>Telecom will be the single most important aspect of computing in the next
<BR>
10 years.  Backbones will jump to 50 Gbit and fiber, microwave and
<BR>
sattelite will have infastructure all over the planet (and probably a few
<BR>
around the dark side of the moon and around Mars, don't laugh!).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    The company we supported with their OpenBoot environment is Network
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Appliance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a group of Sun expatriates, and very capable ones.  
</EM><BR>
<P>I had a feeling, NetApp Filers are excellent machines, the WAFL filesystem
<BR>
is a very smart bit of engineering in its own right, kicked the pants off
<BR>
my test Alpha/NT and Alpha/OSF machine with its specialized embedded OS and
<BR>
optimized drivers.  It had the same &quot;fuzziness factor&quot; of third generation
<BR>
Amigas with embedded OS on a ROM and the nice firmware of the Sun machines
<BR>
(which I still like alot for obvious reasons). 
<BR>
<P>They developed their own
<BR>
<EM>&gt;kernel for their Alpha platforms.  I did my best to encourage Digital, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Compaq to acquire NetApp.  
</EM><BR>
<P>This would have been a great buy, though the way Digital and Compaq were
<BR>
going it would probably have been sold off like most of the other bits were
<BR>
over the years and that would have helped no one.  StrongARM, the PCI
<BR>
bridge chipsets, Ethernet controllers were sold to Intel during the big
<BR>
lawsuit, Cabletron got the switches, hubs and routers, the trend in the
<BR>
last 5 years has been to sell, not buy, so I guess it made some sense from
<BR>
where they were headed at the time (though I'm still not at all sure where
<BR>
that is under Compaq, more consumer &quot;slick&quot; products to compete with Dell?
<BR>
Less emphasis on the server division? What!)  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Dell now re-sells Alpha-based Netapp servers. Netapp developers (core
</EM><BR>
developers of NSF) really wring the &gt;performance from Alpha processors.
<BR>
<P>Yeah, most of the Dell guys didn't even know they were indirectly promoting
<BR>
and profiting of Alpha, isn't it a strange world?  I have a lot of respect
<BR>
for Sun developers in general since they do a good job of optimizing code
<BR>
for UltraSPARC (well, usually).  However, UltraSPARC is a lightweight 64
<BR>
bit RISC compared with Alpha, the late model 64 bit MIPS (notably the
<BR>
R10000 and up) and the HP PA RISC 8500. The old saying goes &quot;if you want to
<BR>
learn to start a good fire with two sticks, learn with the green wood.&quot;
<BR>
Those NetApp guys got ahold of some dry cedar and started a blaze.
<BR>
<P>Network Appliance has not only shown that it is possible
<BR>
<EM>&gt;to make lots of money being on the &quot;bleeding edge&quot;, but that it is also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to build robust platforms.  Netapp filers back up companies like Yahoo and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Amazon.
</EM><BR>
<P>I love the idea of the platform and have implemented their products in my
<BR>
proposals to clients and in the book I'm working on.  Its not a classical
<BR>
OS/hardware platform combination but rather as the name implies an
<BR>
appliance using an embedded OS.  Like your telecom experience has probably
<BR>
shown, embedded OS/apps are the way to go for support, development and
<BR>
stability reasons.  Plus, you can use the new large capacity FeRAMs to
<BR>
store upwards of 1GB of embedded OS, apps and data files at near memory
<BR>
speeds (under 150 ns) when properly implemented.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    The company  formed by the OpenBoot developers (out of Sun) is called
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Firmworks&quot; , www.firmworks.com .  I suspect Firmworks has rights to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;original Alpha port, though the guy who did it moved to Network Appliance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;during the process.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is important, I shall evangelize them and make some connections
<BR>
between API and these people.  If nothing else, it should &quot;make the
<BR>
girlfriend jelous&quot; so to speak and get Compaq thinking about what dragging
<BR>
their feet on a common ALpha firmware will produce in the ALpha clone
<BR>
markets if all of the sudden there is a choice. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    Please don't put Network Appliance name on the &quot;mailing list&quot;, just out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of consideration.  They have no interest in publicly supporting OpenBoot,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but Firmworks is fair game.  I am on good terms with Compaq (I think)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so anyone could contact me.  Aaron Bauch is till with Compaq, though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in a different group, and was the liaison to &quot;Hudson&quot; during the porting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;effort.  Ed Freedman ran (may still run), the group which produces the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;EBSDK (Eval Board Software Dev Kit).
</EM><BR>
<P>Aaron Bauch was involved? Wonder why he hasn't spoken up, maybe I should
<BR>
check on the ALpha/NT list to which he is definitely subscribed.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;    The product Netapp used for their first Alpha platform was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;developed by my group, the OEM division, and was a 14 slot &quot;PICMG&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;platform with a 500 MHz 164 processor.  Netapp fortunately choose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to develop their own 264 boards, much as I tried to drag our group
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;into the &quot;real world&quot;. and have us build the board Netapp wanted.
</EM><BR>
<P>I really like the DMCC stuff, by the way, could you explain to me about the
<BR>
use of the &quot;Interrupt Acceleration&quot; mode (I know there were 4 channels and
<BR>
that these were used to attach addtional modules, not for acceleration I/O
<BR>
devices).  How many PCI devices could the PCI based (not PICMG stuff) 164'
<BR>
machines in terms of concurrent busmasters, slots and available hardware IRQs?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Our division was sold to Smart Modular Computers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in July, which was in-turn bought by Solectron about 3 weeks ago. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;choose to bail even though Smart Modular is in my neighborhood.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I didn't have confidence that Smart Modular could be successful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the CompactPCI business.  In retrospect I could have made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a little pile when the Smart Modular stock jumped before the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;purchase.by Solectron (which also just bought Force).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ironically, I am now surrounded by CompactPCI development
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as the telecom industry moves to CompactPCI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;en-mass.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, I know all about that.  The OEM division was my favorite part of
<BR>
Digital (outside of the AlphaServer and StorageWorks divisions).  I tend to
<BR>
follow what happens with those engineers and the technology they created
<BR>
pretty carefully.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    What is your involvement with Alpha?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm a long term supporter of the Alpha platform and most things (but
<BR>
obviously not all) Digital innovation created.  My primary interests in
<BR>
Alpha came from OpenVMS and later Windows NT, I was one of those hit hard
<BR>
by the Alpha/NT support loss since it constituted most of my old business
<BR>
(I've since moved alot to Sun UltraSPARC/Solaris, Alpha/Linux and am
<BR>
working on getting my certs for Alpha/OpenVMS).  I'm currently writing a
<BR>
book called &quot; The Alpha Platform Handbook&quot; and am constantly looking for
<BR>
resources, especially now that I've had to carve about 300 pages that were
<BR>
already finished and approved by IDG Books (mostly Alpha/Windows 2000
<BR>
content) and reallocate chapters and info to Linux and OpenVMS (low and
<BR>
high end, respectively). 
<BR>
<P>I've contributed to the creation (both directly and indirectly) of quite a
<BR>
few Alpha utils and applications that may not have otherwise existed.  The
<BR>
NT Recovery tools from System Internals (headed up by Mark Russinovich) was
<BR>
one in particular that I felt proud to make the &quot;match&quot; between BEI's Paul
<BR>
Bunn (UltraBac, a fully Alpha and Intel NT backup and image backup software
<BR>
vendor).  There were several less significant tools for making life on
<BR>
Alpha easier, particularly under Windows NT.  I've been working with Aaron
<BR>
Sakovich (runs the Alpha/NT webiste) to create FAQs and HOWTOs as well as
<BR>
collaboration on some NT Magazine articles.  The news took my breath away
<BR>
having invested 5 years into technical writing about, building, selling and
<BR>
support Alpha systems running WIndows NT, Linux and BSD UNIX.  I lost a lot
<BR>
of clients when the news came, many felt betrayed by COmpaq and mislead by
<BR>
me or in any case infurianted that they had no warning as to the fate of
<BR>
their multi-thousand dollar computing investments.
<BR>
<P>I'm busilly trying to simultaneously find information to rebuilt my book
<BR>
project as well as create migration paths and tools for those running
<BR>
Alpha/NT.  My search led me back to OpenVMS at the high end and Linux at
<BR>
the low end (BSD UNIX has become a pretty minor player with all the dev
<BR>
going to Linux).  I'm also trying to make time in my growing family for
<BR>
certification on Open VMS 7.2 Galaxy and Tru 64 UNIX with Tru Cluster.
<BR>
I'll probably take on Tandem certification when Tandem goes Alpha in the
<BR>
EV7 timeline assuming that OS remains seperate and distinct from Tru 64
<BR>
&quot;Non Stop&quot; which is becoming increasingly less likely.
<BR>
<P>I'd like to have some of your insights into this project as it continues to
<BR>
development.  My &quot;modified&quot; release date has now been pushed back to
<BR>
February (compensating for many, many wasted months on now useless Alpha/NT
<BR>
and Alpha/Windows 2000 information).  If you can give me insights into the
<BR>
path of Alpha in the industrial and telecom computing markets (especially
<BR>
running VxWorks) I'd been overwhelmingly appreciative.  Not too many of the
<BR>
contacts I have know the application of Alpha in the telecom and OEM
<BR>
markets anymore (for obvious reasons).
<BR>
<P>If you would prefer phone conversations as opposed to lengthy emails, I can
<BR>
be reached at 503 605 5376 (yes, I'm living right on the doorstep of the
<BR>
evil empire of Intel in Beaverton, OR).

<EM>&gt;&gt; Mike,

<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; I'm glad you came forward with this.  I'll remind API and Compaq of this,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; just in case they have forgotten (or worse, were never privy to this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;info).
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;Your point is a good one Kirk.  Since I am no longer with Q I can say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;one of our largest OEM customers did the work to port OpenBoot to their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;Alpha platforms.  They even offered us the use of their OpenBoot code
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;(but of course they wouldn't have supported it).   We also looked several
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;times at using it on some internal development.  The decision was finally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;to stick with SRM because of the PAL implications (and because it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;was done and could be easily modified for our R&amp;D).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;    If there is interest, the company founded by the creators of OpenBoot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;(which name escapes me at the moment), probably has rights to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;port done by this Silicon Valley file server company, (one of whose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;principle developers moved to the file serve company), and could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;provide OpenBoot very easily, and supply the support (that is their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;business).  I won't put the names on line, but would put an individual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;on the right track .  This would appear to be an OpenBoot opportunity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;to  expand their (yes, there is a profit incentive) market.  In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;retrospect,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;It would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;probably have been to Digital's advantage to use OpenBoot from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;the beginning, though I doubt Microsoft could have been convinced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;to use it.
