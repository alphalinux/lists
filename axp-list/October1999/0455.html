Amen brother Nikita, AMEN!
<BR>
<P>I wonder if only you and I see the problems with the current arrangment?

<EM>&gt;&gt; SRM is licensed and Compaq wants the money to use it.  If SRM was more of

<EM>&gt;&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As a standard, SRM is reasonably open - it's described in the Alpha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Architecture Reference Manual available from bookstores.  What is really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bad is the highly restricted availability of the bits which can't be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;built independently.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Take the PALcode, for example.  I really don't understand why it's not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;available.  PALcode is basically what other processor manufacturers put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;into their chips!  I know it was a good idea to move it into general
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;purpose RAM - flexibility and stuff, but well, can we the processor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;users please have it?  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;My understanding is that Digital assumed nobody would need an Alpha CPU
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;without one of Digital-supported operating systems: Open VMS, Digital
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;UNIX, or Windows NT.  Their attitude towards firmware and PALcode has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;made Alpha CPUs actually unusable without one of those OSes - the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;situation I believe no other processor has ever been in before.  They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(other processors) can all be usefully programmed in machine codes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;using just the architecture specification.  The Alpha can't - unless you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;want to dive into nitty-gritty details of a particular implementation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm not even asking for the full SRM source code (though it would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;really great if it could be made available).  All I'm asking is that all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;platform specific code (initialisation, PALcode) be provided with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hardware systems so their users can run whatever they want.  There is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;no logic in holding on to it.
