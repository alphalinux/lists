A huge market for where floating point performance is crucial is the gaming
<BR>
market.  If you want the best platform for OpenGL 3D games such as
<BR>
Half-Life, QuakeIII then the Athlon is not only the best performance system
<BR>
on the market right now, it is also the best price/performance system (it is
<BR>
rare to achieve both).  It is *not* a rumor that the Athlon will eventually
<BR>
get a 200Mhz bus, it is *fact* (remember that AMD licensed the EV6 bus from
<BR>
Digital).
<BR>
The memory benchmark on the Athlon systems is impressive.  I wrote a Win32
<BR>
program (available at <A HREF="http://www.ultrabac.com/bm_mem.zip">http://www.ultrabac.com/bm_mem.zip</A>) that benchmarks
<BR>
the memory subsystem, and the Athlon system stands up very well against the
<BR>
Alpha systems.  A 600Mhz Athlon scores about 50% better in raw memory
<BR>
throughput than a 533Mhz 21164, but scores half of a 500Mhz 21264.
<BR>
Note that the Athlon is the first AMD system capable of SMP once the
<BR>
necessary motherboards are available.

<P><P><EM>&gt; With Coppermine only slightly slower at a given clock rate,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there is little incentive to buy Athlon. (except those folks who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; despise Intel)
</EM><BR>
<P>We have drifted off topic, but note that the Athlon does much better on
<BR>
floating point than the Coppermine at the same clock. Integer speeds and fp
<BR>
speeds are often not the same; since the average business customer cares
<BR>
more about integer, you will see a lot of comparisons which are integer
<BR>
comparisons that don't state that they are integer comparisons.
<BR>
<P>You get the same situation with Alphas: &quot;Alphas are much faster than Intel
<BR>
chips&quot; &quot;Um, no, they aren't, look at this integer benchmark...&quot;
