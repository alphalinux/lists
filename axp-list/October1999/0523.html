Hello all,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please bear with me here. I am trying out redhat after a long 
<BR>
time. last version I tried was 2.1. I have managed to acquire an old 
<BR>
DECpc AXP 150 aka infamous jensen. I got it with 128mb ram, 
<BR>
2.88mb floppy, SCSI cd-rom &amp; about 6.4gb in SCSI storage. I have 
<BR>
managed to get it to boot up using Sebastian's jensen2.img &amp; 
<BR>
ramdisk2.img &amp; I have reached upto the stage where it asks me for 
<BR>
choice of installation media. so far so good. It seems to have 
<BR>
Kingston Technologies KNE2031+ as a network card. it has BNC, 
<BR>
AUI &amp; UTP connectors. from the documentation I have read, it 
<BR>
seems to be NE2000 compatible and also can emulate WD8013 
<BR>
chipset. I am trying to get it to work using NE2000 driver. if I put 
<BR>
the card in my dos machine, it shows configuration as IO=300 &amp; 
<BR>
IRQ=10, however redhat doesn't seem to want to find that card. is 
<BR>
there anything I am doing wrong? any suggestions? 
<BR>
