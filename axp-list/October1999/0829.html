I recently tried to compile in TGA framebuffer support for my system
<BR>
(UDB running Redhat 6.0)...  Upon rebooting my system, the framebuffer
<BR>
kicked in and I got that lovely image of Tux in the corner of my
<BR>
monitor.  However, the problems started when I tried to use X.  I edited
<BR>
my XF86Config file, linked /etc/X11/X to /usr/X11R6/bin/XF86_FBDev... X
<BR>
started up, but everything was tinted a shade of blue.  Actually, tinted
<BR>
is to too light a word to describe what was happening.  Since I was
<BR>
using the 2.2.13 source code, I decided to try something from the 2.3
<BR>
source tree, and compiled 2.3.10 during the night.  I got the exact same
<BR>
results...  Any ideas or input?  Has anyone encountered this before?  Am
<BR>
I missing something really obvious?  Any help would be appreciated.
<BR>
Thanks.
