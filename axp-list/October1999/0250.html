<EM>&gt; I'm contemplating getting a cable modem from the local provider. (AT&amp;T formerly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TCI)  However, there's one catch, they want to install it on a Windows 9x/NT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; platform.  I really don't want them screwing with my other Windows machines.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So the idea is: Since I have a Multia dual booting Linux and WinNT, let the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cable people install on the WinNT partition, then setup Linux at my own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pace.
</EM><BR>
<P>That worked for me... most cablemodems are really ethernet devices, so
<BR>
they can run on just about any hardware.
<BR>
<P>I booted my SX into NT before the installers came out, and didn't mention
<BR>
a word about Linux.  Interestingly, the sales rep at Comcast knew
<BR>
perfectly well what an Alpha is (he's a former DEC employee, go figure)
<BR>
but the service order clearly said &quot;Pentium&quot;.  I doubt the installers ever
<BR>
even heard of Alpha.  Once they saw the familiar WinNT desktop they knew
<BR>
what to do, though I had disabled FX!32 so their CD-ROM wouldn't run...
<BR>
they just shook their heads and went to the Network control panel applet
<BR>
to finish the install.
<BR>
<P>@HOME issues a static address to each customer, for now, even though they
<BR>
configure each box for DHCP.  (When I later called tech support, one of
<BR>
their first suggestions was to disable DHCP.)  The &quot;media kit&quot; was shipped
<BR>
to me in advance, along with a printout of my host parameters, including
<BR>
host/domain name, IP address, subnet mask, name/mail/proxy servers, i.e.
<BR>
everything I need for Linux ;)
<BR>
<P>Linux worked just fine, of course... in fact when I had problems later due
<BR>
to a bad gateway, I used Linux to run all diagnostics (arp, traceroute,
<BR>
etc.) while I was on the phone with tech support (_they_ knew what Linux
<BR>
is, and seemed almost glad I was using it).
<BR>
<P>The only obstacle was convincing the installers that my tulip was &quot;good
<BR>
enough&quot; and they didn't need to rip apart my machine and install one of
<BR>
their generic PCI cards (Linksys, I think).
