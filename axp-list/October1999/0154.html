Your point is a good one Kirk.  Since I am no longer with Q I can say that
<BR>
one of our largest OEM customers did the work to port OpenBoot to their
<BR>
Alpha platforms.  They even offered us the use of their OpenBoot code
<BR>
(but of course they wouldn't have supported it).   We also looked several
<BR>
times at using it on some internal development.  The decision was finally
<BR>
to stick with SRM because of the PAL implications (and because it
<BR>
was done and could be easily modified for our R&amp;D).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is interest, the company founded by the creators of OpenBoot
<BR>
(which name escapes me at the moment), probably has rights to the
<BR>
port done by this Silicon Valley file server company, (one of whose
<BR>
principle developers moved to the file serve company), and could
<BR>
provide OpenBoot very easily, and supply the support (that is their
<BR>
business).  I won't put the names on line, but would put an individual
<BR>
on the right track .  This would appear to be an OpenBoot opportunity
<BR>
to  expand their (yes, there is a profit incentive) market.  In retrospect,
<BR>
It would
<BR>
probably have been to Digital's advantage to use OpenBoot from
<BR>
the beginning, though I doubt Microsoft could have been convinced
<BR>
to use it.

<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Greetings folks,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have been noticing that indeed, we are in need of a console firmware to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be standard across all new Alpha systems which can support our remaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OSs (most of them UNIX, one VMS).  The alternative is quite different and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably much cheaper if implemented: OpenBoot, a firmware used on SPARC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machines and a few PowerPC development systems (not yet released).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OpenBoot is quite nice, easy to navigate and fully UNIX oriented.  Its
</EM><BR>
also
<BR>
<EM>&gt; free of charge to use and portable across any and every platform.  Its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memory footprint is similar to SRM (which I've seen as System Resource
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Monitor and System Refernce Manual, depending on the age of the system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; documentation), OpenBoot has nothing to do with Compaq and does not
</EM><BR>
require
<BR>
<EM>&gt; permission or liceinsing as such.  A full OpenBoot firmware is better than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a stripped down SRM any day, though a full SRM is pretty tough to beat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feature wise.  OpenBoot supports remote consoles, diagnostics, scripting,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OS config, debugging, remote firmware upgrade, remote boot (obviously) of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OS and remote diagnostics.  It aint' bad.  If you've had a chance to play
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with a recent Ultra SPARC machine, its one of the nicer features that give
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me that &quot;warm fuzzy.&quot;  I love a good firmware.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anyone listening?  API and Slot B clone vendors should investigate this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IEEE 1275 specification and give buyers the option: More costly SRM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equipped version (it's Compaq licensed code) or OpenBoot version (no added
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cost since source is free).  The OpenBoot version may be easier to build
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around since their are many Sun devleopers who could be leveraged for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; task (boot code source would be readily portable once you convert from Big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Endian to Little Endian that is).  It should also make writing console
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; applicaitons (for say, configuring your RAID contoller) much easier to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without having to buy a development kit from Compaq.  There are also quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a few SPARC console apps for OpenBoot which could be ported to ease the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transition (there are few for SRM, so this could be a plus).  The OpenBoot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; UltraSPARC console app that dumps all NVRAM boot and advanced system
</EM><BR>
config
<BR>
<EM>&gt; options to a text file (which you can edit and tweak the hell out of)
</EM><BR>
would
<BR>
<EM>&gt; be great.  Once you create a backup copy of your config to file, you could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tweak away and load the new parameters to test, facilitating some more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; performance out the system in the process while providing a safety net.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anyone interested should query the all important parties (as I intend to)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to get OpenBoot if SRM proves too costly or Compaq drags its feet on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; licensing the Slot B clone board vendors (disasterous effect on Alpha
</EM><BR>
sales).
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Keep up your spirits, there IS light at the end of this tunnel,

<EM>&gt; At 01:40 PM 10/5/99 +0200, you wrote:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;NT must be booted from ARC/Alphabios.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;OSF and VMS must boot from SRM.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Linux can boot from either.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Also note that SRM doesn't understand partitions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;On an AlphaStation you can have both SRM and ARC/Alphabios loaded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;simultaneously. There are other Alphas which can only have one at a time,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and some that can only have ARC/Alphabios, period.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Also note that the recent termination of NT on Alpha also means that any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;further development of ARC/Alphabios has been stopped. This is *serious*,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;since no other parties than Compaq &amp; Microsoft have the sources... Since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Compaq has relegated Alpha to the high-end niche, only SRM will continue
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;be developed, and only on a very limited set of high-end Compaq-brand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;AlphaServers...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The Alpha community is in dire need of an Open Source firmware loader.

<EM>&gt; &gt;Subject: SRM multi OS'es
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Hi all,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I own an Alphastation 200 4/166 with SRM console and OSF 3.2, and I want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to use it for Linux and WIN-NT also.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Is it possible to boot multi Os'es (OSF 3.2, Linux, WIN-NT), or should I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;switch to ARC console ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Any suggestion will be appreciated.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Thanks in advance.
</EM><BR>
