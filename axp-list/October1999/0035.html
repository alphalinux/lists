<EM>&gt; Sure you will... that's what I love about GNU/Linux is that you can just go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and build your own distribution/system to fit your every need/want/whim.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It can take some time but it's a blast.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll probably step on somebody's toes with this statement, but 
<BR>
I don't think RedHat gives a hoot about their Alpha port.  This should
<BR>
come as no surprise; the Alpha port does not bring home the bread &amp; butter
<BR>
like the x86 'cash cow' (and at $80 a pop, quite a fat cow it is).  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several months ago, I spoke with two software engineers at RH
<BR>
about Linux in general and the Alpha in particular.  I had hoped to
<BR>
hear some positive comments for use in an interview/article for the ALO 
<BR>
website.  The phrase &quot;openly hostile&quot; best describes their comments and
<BR>
attitudes about Alpha systems.  I realize you cannot extrapolate corporate
<BR>
direction from the comments of a couple employees, but they made it sound
<BR>
like very few people in the company felt the Alpha port was worth their
<BR>
effort. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I relayed the info back to the other ALO members, and needless to
<BR>
say we were a bit miffed.  Debated whether or not to go ahead with the
<BR>
article, but eventually backed off.  It was probably the best decision at
<BR>
the time..  RedHat is just doing what every big company does - allocating
<BR>
the most funding and time towards what returns the greatest dividends.  
<BR>
I'm sure that cash funneling in from Intel comes into play somewhere, but
<BR>
I won't touch that speculation. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you guys feel a modern Alpha-dedicated distribution (hailing
<BR>
back to the days of Blade) is best, or whether integrating Alpha ports
<BR>
into existing distros (SuSE, Debian, etc.) would be better in the long
<BR>
run?    
<BR>
