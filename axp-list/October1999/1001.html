</EM><BR>
<P>I think being substantially cheaper makes a good incentive. Of course the current
<BR>
Athlon's are not copper yet. This has Intel comparing a newer technology to an older
<BR>
one and still failing. the Dresden fab will be cranking out Copper Athlon processors
<BR>
very soon, which will widen the gap that AMD already leads in even more.
<BR>
<P>There is little to no incentive to waste your money on the Intel processors,
<BR>
especially considering Intel's track record. Athlon has a vastly superior motherboard.
<BR>
You will not be upgrading your system with a new motherboard every 4-6 months like you
<BR>
will with Intel just to stay current.
<BR>
<P>I went through this with Alphas.
<BR>
<P>I bought a 533mhz. Alpha system back whenb they were 4995.00 (several years ago) beat
<BR>
the hell out of any of the Intel offerings for speed. (I use Lightwave 3D for
<BR>
animation) A friend of mine bought a new PC system that was top off the line back
<BR>
then) over the last few years, to stay current he has bought 5 motherboards just to
<BR>
stay current, going from an AT motherboard to an early ATX, then the socket 7 was
<BR>
limited to 200mhz, so he had to get a different board to accomodate socket 7 with MMX,
<BR>
then to PII, he bought a 233, 266, 300 etc. just to keep up. completely changed ram
<BR>
twice as I recall going from his original to EDO and then to SDRAM. during all these
<BR>
changes and the thousands of extra dollars he spent, his Intel box ended up costing
<BR>
WAY more than I paid for my Alpha box, and he still could not lay any claim to being
<BR>
faster or for that matter even close. MY original Alpha just keeps working right
<BR>
along, no upgrades, no modifications, no swapping parts and it still fares well
<BR>
against even the newest of Intel systems.
<BR>
<P>The Athlon, long term is going to be the same way. All the hardware sites say Intel
<BR>
has hit the wall with their outdated technology, and all have said the Athlon has
<BR>
barely scratched the surface.
<BR>
<P>Where then is your incentive to buy Intel unless you are only interested in the Intel
<BR>
Inside sticker?
