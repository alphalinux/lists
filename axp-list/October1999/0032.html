<EM>&gt;&gt; I would think that language imperfections in SuSE manuals are really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a minor point and besides there are far from beeing a sole province
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of SuSE.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What personally bugs me the most in SuSE distros are three things:
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   - a way of maintaining most of a configuration information in one huge,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     clunky and opaque blob; this means that if you want to change your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     e-mail address, and if you are doing that in an &quot;official way&quot;, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     all of sudden your web server, and TeX installation, get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     reconfigured in not necessarily predictable manner (I am dead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     serious here).  If you need to maintain a few different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     configurations (think, for example, a laptop which moves) with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     few subsets which change independently then the whole thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     exponentially explodes unless you throw away all that junk and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     maintain things yourself - but then you are screwed on updates.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     To make matters more &quot;interesting&quot; an odd piece of configuration,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     like routing information, is all of sudden tucked in some remote
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     corner and later you scratch your head trying to figure out what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     went wrong
</EM><BR>
<P>Unfortunatelly, you are soooo right, even regarding SuSE on Intel
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;   - yast is terrible in __maintaining__ your system and grown men
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     were reduced to tears trying to figure out how to fight it.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>YEP, I'm now trying for days now to install 6.1/Intel the way I would
<BR>
like it (really only a few changes required) and the supplied 2.2.5 SuSE
<BR>
modified kernel crashes as soon as ipxd is activated. Works with
<BR>
original 2.2.12, however. YET, after removing about 350 MB of
<BR>
unnecessary junk and adding other more interesting packages from the CDs
<BR>
(always checking and insuring YAST's dependencies) the whole system
<BR>
started to behave erratically and finally crashed hard during CDROM
<BR>
access - before I could save the final package list and rc.config
<BR>
-(while doing some backup over the net in the background, I admit), on
<BR>
hardware that ran 1.2.13 (pre-YAST) flawlessly for years. After that,
<BR>
the system was unusable. I hate YAST, but, as you write, if you ignore
<BR>
it, you have to start all over again the next (update) time !
<BR>
<P>(YET, up to now, I *always* did complete installs, as I don't trust the
<BR>
whole updat process, as soon as you have a somewhat nontrivial
<BR>
configuration, but I hoped to end with that in the future !!).
