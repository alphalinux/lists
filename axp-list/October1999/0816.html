<P>
I haven't done any development on any variant of unix. I found 
<BR>
getting used to gdb rather hard..but that's what you get after 
<BR>
spending too much time using MSVC. anyways..using good old 
<BR>
printfs, I have found out where awk is hanging. but I don't have 
<BR>
enough familiarity with code( rather tools ) to figure out why. If any 
<BR>
of you gurus have any ideas, suggestions, please give me a shout. 
<BR>
Now to describe the situation....
<BR>
<P>Scenario: #1
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are running awk using following command line..
<BR>
cr-734636-a$ gawk -f swaplns.awk
<BR>
<P>In this case, after bunch of command line &amp; other processing we 
<BR>
finally land in a function called 'nextfile' in io.c from gawk source. 
<BR>
This function contains a for loop that is supposed to run from 1 to 
<BR>
some variable. It looks like starting value is 1 to stop over argv[0] 
<BR>
which is going to contain name that was used to launch the binary( 
<BR>
'gawk' in this case ). When gawk is being run as in scenarion #1, 
<BR>
variable in for loop evaluates to 1. so loop is not executed &amp; awk 
<BR>
behaves as if no filename was passed to it. It opens stdin &amp; waits 
<BR>
for input. This leads me to believe that command line argument 
<BR>
parsing done by awk is for some reason toast on jensen. I 
<BR>
unfortunately will not have much time for next few days, but if there 
<BR>
are any C gurus among us, I would dearly love to get some help in 
<BR>
resolving this issue. It's extremly irritating to have to do 'make 
<BR>
config' &amp; answer 300 questions to be able to build kernel instead of 
<BR>
using 'make menuconfig' which uses awk :(
