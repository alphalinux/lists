Hi list,
<BR>
<P>thanks for all the suggestions that came in on my previous inquiry on
<BR>
this subject. I have looked around for suitable harddrives and found
<BR>
some that where reasonably priced and have large space, e.g., the IBM
<BR>
Ultrastar series. The DNES-318350 for example, with 18.2 GB storage
<BR>
space is priced at $399.-. The problem with this as well as with other
<BR>
drives in the range at or above 9GB is that they are all UltraSCSI, and
<BR>
many come with a wider connector. There are SCA -&gt; SCSI interface
<BR>
adaptors that reduce the connector width back to 50 pins, but I am not
<BR>
sure whether they would work on the alpha's. Furthermore, the UltraSCSI
<BR>
drives are spec'ed at 20 or 40 MB/s which is more than my current
<BR>
NCR53C-810 controller will yield. My questions at this points therefore
<BR>
are:
<BR>
1. Would it be possible to get an UltraSCSI drive to work with a SCSI-2
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;controller on the AlphaStations, possibly with the interface adaptor
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that reduces the connector to 50 pin? Has anyone done this in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;past successfully? I realize that there would be an obvious
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;degrading in speed from the specs. I am also wondering whether the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;old SCSI-2 adaptor will actually be able to handle harddrives larger
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than 8GB.
<BR>
2. Would it be possible to add the UltraSCSI drive as a second drive to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the machine by getting a PCI bus SCSI controller? This way I would
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keep the old controller on the motherboard hooked up to the original
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1GB Quantum HD and plug the IBM HD in to a new SCSI controller on the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PCI bus. This might be the better solution since it seems to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preserve the speed. Would it be possible to boot off the new disk at
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all? Following Kirk Erichsen's and Paul Bunn's suggestions I am
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looking at the Symbios 22915 PCI-&gt;Ultra3 adapter or its little
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brother, the SYM8951U. Is there anything that looks questionable
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with this plan of action?
<BR>
<P>While I am at it: Can anybody suggest a source where I can buy the
<BR>
ZLXp-E3 video card? I currently have to live with an 8bit ZLXp-E1 and
<BR>
would like to upgrade. Apparently, these cards are not anymore in
<BR>
production and I would have to find a shop that hawks off the remaining
<BR>
inventory or a second hand shop.
<BR>
<P>Thank you very much in advance for any helpful comments on the above.
<BR>
Best regards, Alex.
<BR>
<P><PRE>
