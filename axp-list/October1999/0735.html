Enlightenment is da bomb. All hail raster and mandrake. Nuff said ;-)
<BR>
I like gnome but it doesn't seem to be all there yet nevermind it's a PITA
<BR>
to compile. kde is cool, i like it alot. far easier to build though I
<BR>
&quot;hate&quot; their window manager. it just can't do sloppy focus right. So I use
<BR>
E and call whatever I need from either gnome &amp; kde from a Eterm.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Here's more fuel for the fire......
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've been using Enlightenment since I first installed MkLinux on my old
&gt; &gt; PowerMac a few years back.  E-0.13 - E-0.16 have worked great for me.
&gt; &gt; Now, the configuration is simple with the included configuration
&gt; &gt; utilities. (i.e., you can turn of edge flipping or change the
&gt; &gt; resistance)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I haven't observed any problems with E-0.15 on alpha.  The only problems
&gt; &gt; I've seen with E-0.16 on alpha were the compile problems I had earlier
&gt; &gt; and the &quot;snapshots on&quot; option in the new Enlightenment pager not being
&gt; &gt; completely supported by the X-server.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There's no question that Enlightenment is more expensive w.r.t. CPU
&gt; &gt; cycles.  There's no question that other wm's have similiar
&gt; &gt; functionality.  But is it okay for me to like E because it looks
&gt; &gt; pretty?  I have to stare at the darn thing all day!! :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My first computer was a Mac so I guess I'm a sucker for this stuff.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's not very helpful:-)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Indeed, but both in 0.15 and in 0.16 an &quot;edge resistance&quot;, from
&gt; &gt; &gt; what I could observe, was hardwired.  Probably it is intended to
&gt; &gt; &gt; be settable in future versions but I do not have one. :-)
&gt; &gt; &gt; Can you change it in what you have on hand?
