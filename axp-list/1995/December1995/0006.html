Howdy ppl!<br>
<p>
I'm just feeling bored in this exams period, so I think I will<br>
folloup on this one more time...<br>

<i>&gt;   Mikael&gt; If Digital could start manufactoring lowcost motherboards</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Mikael&gt; (the cpu's are very affordably already), then Linux/Alpha</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Mikael&gt; could be a 'explosive' market..</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; To a good degree this is a chicken and egg problem (as usual): without</i><br>
<i>&gt; volume, prices are high and with high prices, volume remains low.</i><br>
<p>
Yep, very true. But we must keep one thing in mind, we can never <br>
demand that customers buy the product enough so you can lower the price<br>
becuase of higher volume. Its the company that needs to lower the price<br>
(and probably make a much smaller profit in the beginning), and wait for <br>
the customers to start buying the product, and then start collecting <br>
money.. =)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Having said that, it does look to me like a lot of vendors regard</i><br>
<i>&gt; non-x86 systems as cash cows.</i><br>
<p>
Also very true. Ofcourse, in the non-x86 business there is ofter higher<br>
quality and need for better support, which costs alot of money. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My hope is that two things will happen: (a) really, really low-cost</i><br>
<i>&gt; Alpha boards start to get produced (e.g., by some Asian manufacturer)</i><br>
<p>
Yes. This is whats really need to be done. Like a 'Asus' for Alpha<br>
motherboards. What do I mean by that? Thats a company making good<br>
'standard boards', nothing fancy but they work excellent. And you <br>
dont get the whole support from an organization like Digital. I see 2 <br>
very reasons for having a company from the outside making these lowend<br>
boards:<br>
<p>
1. The 'lowend' boards doesnt need to pay for all the 'fancy' support<br>
   that Digital needs to have to keep its good reputation.<br>
<p>
2. The highend buyers that wants a 'real' Digital workstation, could <br>
   still get the good support that digital offers.<br>
<p>
Infact, I think getting a company like Asus producing lowcost Alpha<br>
motherboards would be the best that could happen. They already have<br>
the knowledge of howto making mothersboards cheap, and still make a profit.<br>
This would mean several good things (IMHO)<br>
<p>
* It would mean alot more cpus would be sold, which means higher profit<br>
  and the chance of lower the price (which would also could mean cheaper<br>
  'real' machines which also means more competetive against companies like<br>
  hp,ibm and so on..)<br>
<p>
* Introducing the wounderful Alpha architecture as a powerful and <br>
  reasonably prised platform. I know alot of friends that are <br>
  students/isp/unix admins which all would buy alphamotherboards<br>
  if they were price/perf competetive with x86. All of them wants to<br>
  get away from the x86 arch, but for example the Noname 233Mhz<br>
  version gives about 120Mhz Pentium perfomance, but for almost twice <br>
  the money (x86: $400 cpu + $300 MB + $70 ncr ctrl vs Alpha: $1290 MB+cpu <br>
  + $100 cache). Myself gladely pays the 'small' pricetag, but the big<br>
  mass wont.<br>
<p>
* With the soon ability of really highend and cheap 3D gfx-card, based on <br>
  chipset like GLiNT. And that several companys are porting OPENGL to Linux<br>
  (and hopefully Linux/Alpha).With a gfx card like that, and a Alpha cpu,<br>
  which are very good at FP, it would be perfect systems for cad/cam and <br>
  stuff like that. Should be very competetive with systems like Intergraph <br>
  sells...<br>
<p>
I know there exists complete chipsets/books and stuff on the subject of<br>
designing Alpha motherboards, but I think Digital needs to encourage<br>
a company like Asus in one way or another, because they only have their<br>
eyes on the x86 market and needs a little help to find the way to the<br>
right path.. ;)<br>
<p>
Just my $0.02 ... =)<br>
