<P><EM>&gt;(3) I think you should continue to manage _alpha_irq_masks from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;generic code instead of having a separate instance of cached_irq_mask
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from virtually every sys_foo.c.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not only from every sys_foo.c but for every irq controller driver. It make
<BR>
sense that each controller manages its own local caching of the masking
<BR>
because they are all per-controller caches. So each controller is free to
<BR>
cache the information in its preferred way. But yes, by sharing the
<BR>
_alpha_irq_mask we would avoid to waste some byte of memory. I did such
<BR>
choice to generate the cleaner code possible and to left local things that
<BR>
are local (so I didn't had to bother about side effects of the changes
<BR>
inside each irq controller driver and I could basically cut-and-paste
<BR>
arch/i386/kernel/i8259.c). If there won't be side effects and advantages
<BR>
I'll agree to replace the per-irq cache with a global cache of course.

<EM>&gt;        case 1:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;-               handle_irq(RTC_IRQ, -1, &amp;regs);
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;+               handle_irq(RTC_IRQ, &amp;regs);
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A timer tick that comes in through entInt(1,...) need not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and should not be acked.  PALcode has already done that. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I don't see a mechanism for this.
</EM><BR>
<P>I know very well of such problem and infact my code is still very
<BR>
experimental and I _don't_ use the RTC as timer interrupt so I don't care
<BR>
about its acking and masking right now (I noticed the purpose of passing
<BR>
-1 as ack in the old code was to skip the mask and ack).
<BR>
<P>Of course I'll have to implement a special RTC hw_interrupt_type vector
<BR>
that does nothing in the ack and mask callback. I can set the handler in
<BR>
the common code for all platforms. This looks very cleaner than passing a
<BR>
magic value to the irq main routine to differentiate between irq types.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;That's all I see for now.  If I get ambitious this evening
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I may see about updating the patch for all of sys_foo.c and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;try it out on some other systems.
</EM><BR>
<P>Many thanks! IMHO another option would be to ignore the other sys_*.c
<BR>
until the tsunami platform (the one I use for developement) will be
<BR>
completly stable (so addressing the RTC case plus the SMP case that
<BR>
doesn't boot here). So we won't risk having to fix two times the other
<BR>
platforms if we'll need to redesign something. In other words I would
<BR>
suggest to update only the platform necessary for the developement until
<BR>
we'll be completly happy. Of course if you'll do the update your patch
<BR>
will be _very_ welcome even now! But beware: we'll risk a bit having to do
<BR>
it again later...
<BR>
<P><P>I'll address your other points ASAP.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for your comments!
