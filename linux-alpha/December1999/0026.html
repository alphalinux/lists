<P>Woops I was completly wrong. Linus applyed both my two patches (alpha-1.gz
<BR>
and alpha-1-to-2.gz) that I posted to this list in 2.3.30 (I was looking
<BR>
at 2.3.30pre6 that AFIK is been released after I sent my patches and so I
<BR>
thought I missed the boat for 2.3.30 ;).
<BR>
<P>So if vanilla 2.3.30 doesn't compile for you please give me the error and
<BR>
I'll fix it ASAP! ;) Thanks.
<BR>
<P>So in 2.3.30 there is also the ____cacheline_aligned that we was wondering
<BR>
about. Should I change it just because the `__' of difference is not
<BR>
enough? As he accepted it I am fine with it, my main concern was that it
<BR>
was the most ugly part of the patch, but as I had no more fantasy during
<BR>
the developement... ;).
<BR>
<P>Andrea
<BR>
<P>PS. &quot;struct&quot;_cacheline_aligned seems not the best either because you may
<BR>
as well want to cacheline align a not-structured variable (for a
<BR>
test_and_set_bit based SMP/irq locking for example) as in the two liner
<BR>
case that I liked to compile with gcc-2.7.2.3... (hmm but I just found a
<BR>
machine with an old installation not in my home so I'll try it now)...
