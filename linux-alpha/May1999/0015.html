<EM>&gt; &gt;    I have no definitive answer, but I would strongly suspect we cannot

<EM>&gt; &gt;    rely on tick mechanisms with SMP.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Unless Alpha's support different clock rate cpus mixed into a single

<EM>&gt; &gt; machine, you can use something like Ingo's tick calibration code at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; boot time to make sure all cpu's have synchronized tick values.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't believe that any of our boxes support CPUs at different clocks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at the same time... ;-}
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But that's a good idea, WRT those patches, as I have been seeing one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effect of routing all interrupts to CPU #0: its tick-count (IRQ #8)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lags behind the counts in the other CPUs... :-\
</EM><BR>
<P>[ ... ]
<BR>
<P>I'm sorry to keep harping on this, but I still don't know the answer to
<BR>
the original main question.
<BR>
<P>In late November I submitted a patch to arch/alpha/kernel/time.c to fix
<BR>
some obvious problems and to try to stabilize timekeeping.  A non-obvious
<BR>
consequence of this patch was that timekeeping was now based on the
<BR>
cycle counter, instead of the RTC or PIT.  The RTC/PIT was still used as
<BR>
a &quot;wakeup&quot;, but not as the actual basis for kernel jiffies.
<BR>
<P>This patch was added to the kernel, but I missed it when scanning the
<BR>
patch files, so I assumed it had been rejected.  In the meantime I found
<BR>
some cases I had overlooked (mostly in settimeofday()) and updated my
<BR>
local patches to fix these.
<BR>
<P>At the end of December I rechecked and discovered that the original patch
<BR>
had been accepted, so I submitted the second fix with a note that perhaps
<BR>
it should wait until 2.3, as I thought 2.3 was imminent.
<BR>
<P>The second patch was rejected, leaving timekeeping still broken, although
<BR>
perhaps not quite as badly as it had been.
<BR>
<P>Around the beginning of March I had correspondence with another Alpha user
<BR>
who was quite dissatisfied with the timekeeping.  The main symptom was
<BR>
that time-of-day sometimes jumped backward.  After much email I found
<BR>
most of the remaining problems.  I submitted another patch but included
<BR>
the suggestion/request that the original patch be backed-out, as by then
<BR>
I had read the claim that SMP Alpha CPUs have unsynchronized clocks.
<BR>
<P>This patch was also rejected or perhaps missed, as I sent it only to the
<BR>
list in hope of clarification from someone.
<BR>
<P>Around the end of April someone else (Thorsten Kranzkowski) submitted a
<BR>
patch fixing part of the lost-tick accounting, which was in patch three.
<BR>
Someone else referred Thorsten to my earlier message, and he resubmitted
<BR>
that patch with some changes.
<BR>
<P>The point of this long harangue is that Alpha kernels currently use the
<BR>
cycle counter for timekeeping.  If SMP Alpha clocks are unsynchronized,
<BR>
this is a Bad Thing.  Please note that &quot;unsynchronized&quot; refers to the
<BR>
frequencies, and not phase differences.  To restate this, as there may be
<BR>
some confusion, a frequency difference implies that the offsets between
<BR>
different CPU cycle counters *change* over time.  For example, a frequency
<BR>
difference of one part-per-million would cause a drift of one jiffy in
<BR>
about fifteen minutes.
<BR>
<P>The only way frequency differences can be avoided is to use a common
<BR>
clock source across CPUs.  This could either be the actual clock used as
<BR>
input to the CPU, or it could be a slower clock that is phase-locked to
<BR>
the CPU input clock.
<BR>
<P>So the question remains: Do SMP Alpha CPUs have synchronized input clocks?
<BR>
<P>If they are not sychronized, this code must be replaced with something
<BR>
else.
<BR>
<P>If they are synchronized, SMP timekeeping can be fixed by either resetting
<BR>
the cycle counters via PalCode at boot time, or by measuring the offsets
<BR>
at boot time.
<BR>
<P>Assuming synchronized clocks, the pros and cons for using the cycle counter
<BR>
appear (to me) to be:
<BR>
<P>Con:
<BR>
<P>The underlying clock may be less stable than the RTC or PIT.  Assuming
<BR>
synchronized CPU clocks, I would expect the PIT to be derived from the
<BR>
same source.
<BR>
<P>Pro:
<BR>
<P>The cycle counter provides two orders-of-magnitude better resolution than
<BR>
the PIT.  The PIT counter can be accessed, giving about one microsecond
<BR>
resolution.
<BR>
<P>The cycle counter provides five orders-of-magnitude better resolution than
<BR>
the RTC.  The RTC offers no resolution beyond the fact that an interrupt
<BR>
occurred.
