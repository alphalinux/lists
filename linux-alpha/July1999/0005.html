<P><EM>&gt; Hi all,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I just ran speed tests on a Compaq XP1000 (CPU 21264) that has been lent to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me (I will buy one if it suits me).  I installed beforehand Redhat 6.0, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I downloaded from a redhat mirror. 2 problems arose:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1) The math library seems *very* slow:
</EM><BR>
<P>Indeed.  Get either the Compaq Portable Math Library, or if you prefer free
<BR>
software and/or your code can make use of vectorized sqrt/sin/cos (i.e. perform
<BR>
sin on these 100 numbers) then get libffm, both from <A HREF="http://www.alphalinux.org/">http://www.alphalinux.org/</A>
<BR>
(ALO).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So I downloaded the glibc sources from GNU and compiled with different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; options (I added '-O2 -mcpu=21264', and removed -mieee), but the speed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increase was only 7%.
</EM><BR>
<P>My, you're brave!  And you call yourself a &quot;beginner&quot;? :-)
<BR>
<P>I think the optimizations you want are '-O6 -mcpu=ev6' but 21264 and ev6 may do
<BR>
the same thing.  I think -O6 includes -ffast-math which is needed to get the
<BR>
hardware sqrt on 21264.  But CPML and libffm are hand-coded assembly which
<BR>
should give you significantly better performance than optimized glibc- and they
<BR>
avoid some of the floating exceptions such as the exp (-large) underflow.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2) I tried to run a very large program, but I failed: it crashes with this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; error message:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Floating point exception (core dumped)
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup, a common problem on Alpha.  Here's a recent post from the high-performance
<BR>
list (instructions also on ALO):

<EM>&gt;  &gt; Why is -mieee compiled code so slow? I thought, only when an execption is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; generated, the mieee routines should provide values like inf, NaN.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Otherwise the FPU could proceed as usual?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since &quot;exceptions&quot; are exceptional, they are, by definition very infrequent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If they were meant to be commonplace, they would be called &quot;commons&quot; or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some such.  Unfortunately, there _is_ a fair amount of sloppy code in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world where specific integer values are used to trigger termination
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conditions, and are freely operated on as if they are floating point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; values.  Some processors/architectures silently convert NaNs/denorms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into zero results, or ignore them.  In my opinion, encouraging sloppy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; programming habits by masking such effects is bad.  This silent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; behavior can hide nastiness like memory leaks elsewhere in the code.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In Alpha implementations prior to the 21264, floating point exceptions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were imprecise.  That is, they were not necessarily reported until after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the instruction which may have caused them has been retired.  The trade-off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here is that fp-intensive code which operates with 'normal' values
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can really scream.  But fixing up exceptions is going to be more complex,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and will consume a bunch of cycles.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In the Alpha Architecture Reference Manual, there is a section about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arithmetic traps &amp; trap shadows, etc. which goes into a lot of detail
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the code sequences to fix these up.  One of the requirements of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; code to handle such behavior is (on alpha prior to the 21264) to insert
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'trapb' (trap barrier) instructions in lots of places.  The trapb
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instruction forces the processor to wait (stalling it!) until all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exceptions have been reported before continuing.  There are also some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rules about register re-use among instructions between trap shadows.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On the 21264, exceptions are precise, and trapb instructions are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effectively nops, which will significantly improve things (assuming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you eventually get one).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The net requirement of -mieee is to generate more conservative code,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and to insert trapb instructions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If your code generates lots of exceptions at a small number of locations,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you could put that code into a single file, and only compile that file
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with -mieee.  If you really care about floating point performance,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's probably worth the effort to debug and modify your code to not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do NaN/denorm operations.  You might inadvertently fix some bugs as well.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I hope this helps some,
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt; Reply-to: gorton@scrugs.lkg.dec.com
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I get the same errors on Intel, but the program doesn't stop, and that suits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me very well.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So I tried to catch the exception with the signal function (signal(SIGFPE,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; handler)): the handler function is actually called, but that doesn't prevent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the program from crashing with the same message.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is there a way to prevent the crash (and if possible, without reducing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; program speed) ?
</EM><BR>
<P>You can prevent the crash by compiling with -mieee but with a significant
<BR>
performance hit- see above.
<BR>
<P>I'm ccing this reply to axp-list@redhat.com, because for some reason that list
<BR>
has a much greater population and AFAICT more knowledgable subscribers than any
<BR>
other I have found, and because you're using RedHat.
