Thank you everyone who helped me in moving the dma window.  It turned out
<BR>
to be a combination of adding a call to pyxis_native_window_setup in
<BR>
ruffian_pci_fixup after changing the dma defines.  That and remembering to
<BR>
recompile the loadable module that I was doing this for.  My sound now
<BR>
works, along with everything else.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know, though, how much work would be involved in
<BR>
adding scatter-gather DMA support to the kernel.  Having read the docs I
<BR>
have an idea now of what it actually is, so I'm prompted to a few
<BR>
questions:
<BR>
1. Can scatter gather dma be done on a system as well as the dma window
<BR>
scheme currently in use so that a driver can simply opt to take advantage
<BR>
of it rather than needing to be rewritten?
<BR>
2. Would adding support for it for the alphas require implementing a
<BR>
platform-independent method of doing scatter-gather dma and then
<BR>
implementing it on the alpha?
<BR>
3. Is there anyone who's currently working on adding scatter-gather dma
<BR>
support, or at least in the planning stages and thus the person to talk to
<BR>
in terms of helping?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, thank you all for your kind help.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Chris Lansdown
