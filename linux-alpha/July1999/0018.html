<EM>&gt; &gt; A question: I've heard that in the 21264/EV6 SMP design all interrupts

<EM>&gt; &gt; this has on the behavior of these systems in Beowulf configurations or

<EM>&gt; Yes, as far as I know that's true.  It was anticipated that this would

<P>On the DP264 motherboard with the Tsunami chipset that is -not- true. 
<BR>
The Tsunami chipset has separate processor 0 and processor 1 interrupt
<BR>
registers (interrupt requests, interrupt masks, etc.)  So the hardware
<BR>
is capable of delivering individual interrupts to specific processors. 
<BR>
However, the software must have a mechanism for supporting such a
<BR>
hardware design.  On the dual processor intel platforms the same rules
<BR>
apply so I -assume- Linux has a mechanism for designating interrupts to
<BR>
processors.  But, I don't know for sure.  Assignment of interrupts to
<BR>
specific processors (or to multiple processors) is either limited by
<BR>
software or hardware.  In the case of the DP264, the hardware is not the
<BR>
limiting factor.
<BR>
<P>I have looked at the code in a pre 2.2 version and found that only one
<BR>
host bridge was supported.  I'd be interested in sharing a solution I
<BR>
employed to get both host bridges on the DP264 working.  My solution
<BR>
applied to a proprietary O/S (can you guess which one?  ;-)  but it's
<BR>
fair for me to share the general strategy employed.
