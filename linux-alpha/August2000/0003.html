Hi Warren,
<BR>
<P>Per your disk layout and per the default RH Alpha 6.2 install, you should
<BR>
simply be able to boot your system as follows:
<BR>
<P>boot dqb0 -fl 0
<BR>
<P>The new RH 6.2 uses the latest aboot.  It uses a new format.  
<BR>
<P>For this to work, the assumptions RH makes are as follows:
<BR>
<P>1.)  The /boot directory can be found in the 2nd disk partition.  As you
<BR>
laid your disk for us below, the /boot is not in a separate partition, and
<BR>
therefore will be in the / partition which as you say is the 2nd partition.
<BR>
<P>2.)  The flag == 0, means your boot kernel is the first entry in your
<BR>
/etc/aboot.conf file.  
<BR>
<P>3.)  RH 6.2 places aboot in the beginning of your disk for you.
<BR>
<P>So, if this does not work....
<BR>
<P>1.)  Boot the RH CD while mounting the hard drive
<BR>
<P>boot dqa0 -fi kernels/generic.gz -fl &quot;root=/dev/hdc2&quot;  (you may need to
<BR>
change the 2 to another number to get this to work).
<BR>
<P>2.)  Determine what partition the /boot directory really exists in by
<BR>
viewing the /etc/fstab file.
<BR>
<P>3.)  Tell aboot what partition to use at next boot:
<BR>
<P>abootconf /dev/hdc  X  
<BR>
<P>4.)  Shutdown 
<BR>
<P>5.)  boot using the &quot;boot dqb -fl 0&quot; scheme again.
<BR>
<P>Please remember I am writing this from memory, and I do not have an Alpha in
<BR>
front of me to confirm this (at this time).
<BR>
<P>HTH,
<BR>
<P>Tim
<BR>
<P>If this does not work, I would suggest the following:

<BR>
<P><P>Hi,
<BR>
FIRSTLY, apologies if this is too simple a question!!
<BR>
finally I got to boot my digital 433a from SRM with Redhat 6.2 Alpha.
<BR>
I have the system installed! (mandrake in the BIN)
<BR>
&nbsp;I've rebooted and I'm back at SRM console.
<BR>
<P>How can I boot my system now!  Do I use ABOOT or can I boot directly
<BR>
from SRM. Can I boot from CD and use flags?? I have a partition at the
<BR>
start of the HD but how do I get aboot on it?
<BR>
It would appreciate if somebody could help me over the last hurdle.  I
<BR>
can't seem to get any info AT ALL from the Red Hat manual or
<BR>
alphalinux.org
<BR>
<P>heres my setup.....
<BR>
hdc1 32mb DOS (no aboot installed)
<BR>
hdc2 /
<BR>
hdc5 SWAP
<BR>
hdc6 /usr
<BR>
<P>I'm at SRM console
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;boot dqb0 -file ??????  -flags &quot;root=/dev/hdc2&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>thanks,
