<P>
[just as a pre-info: i currently try to get the sfi xfs filesystem
<BR>
running on non x86 architectures - got to the point of a kernel bug
<BR>
on the ppc for which i have a fix now and hope that it works this
<BR>
evening then i try it and now tried the alpha ... keep in mind that
<BR>
this is still code under development - so don't expect anything
<BR>
useful out of the box here on the alpha - but if you like to help
<BR>
me testing and maybe debugging this to get a good filesystem for
<BR>
the alpha just read on and have a look at the sgi xfs list]
<BR>
<P>ok - just tried the next one :-)
<BR>
<P>kernel builds fine (with the below patch - what are the double under-
<BR>
scored types btw.?) and i was able to mount the filesystem instantly
<BR>
without a problem - i also was able to copy the whole /etc tree over
<BR>
to it and remove it again - the try to compile bonnie for running it
<BR>
resulted in a pagebuf error (but no crash - only a fs shutdown due
<BR>
to an io error) - so it looks quite promising - also there were some
<BR>
compile time warnings which i'll look through carefully - maybe it's
<BR>
in there anywhere ... also debugging the pagebuf stuff should be
<BR>
a bit easier now that there is also kdb less pagebuf tracing from
<BR>
the ppc here (btw.: any chance to get this included into the tree if
<BR>
i clean it up a bit? - i think it might be a good help for new kdbless
<BR>
arches)
<BR>
<P>more details about any errors i cannot resolve i will post after
<BR>
the weekend (it's time for a break now :-)
<BR>
<P>looks like it gets time that the mkfs and repair commands get more
<BR>
easily compilable on other arches too so that one can play around
<BR>
with real filesystems instead of my 32mb image ... is there any
<BR>
<EM>&gt; timeframe planned for the cleanup of those two tools ?
</EM><BR>
<P>ok - for anyone who want to help getting this working (i'll post this
<BR>
to the alpha list too - maybe someone there will help too) - just
<BR>
pick up the sources from oss.sgi.com's cvs tree (linux-2.4-xfs) and
<BR>
my patches from
<BR>

<BR>
<P>(don't get confused by the ppc - they are good for the alpha too and
<BR>
gives the pagebuf tracing for debugging :-) and have a look at the sgi
<BR>
xfs list (details you can also find at oss.sgi.com)
<BR>
<P>so far thanks for the sgi guys for providing a - so far - very arch-
<BR>
portable code as it looks like
