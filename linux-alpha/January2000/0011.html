Hi All,
<BR>
<P>This same discussion is also going on internally to CPQ, and here is the
<BR>
current observation...
<BR>
<P>------------------------------
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I receive the above about a date problem on linux :
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have had a call from CSC who have a loan DS20 running Linux RH 6.0.
</EM><BR>
They
<BR>
<EM>&gt; have reported that they have several files which have dates on them of
</EM><BR>
2047.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Whether this was true before the beginning of 2000 is not known.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Interestingly I also have a machine (an old 433 PWS) which also has files
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dates 2047.  Not all files from last year have 2047, it would appear to
</EM><BR>
only
<BR>
<EM>&gt; be files touched before the end of 1999.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; i have a dpws with this king of behaviour too ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Any thoughts ?
</EM><BR>
<P>Are you (or they) dual-booting Tru64 UNIX and Linux on the system?
<BR>
<P>Tru64 UNIX maintains the hardware Time of Year (TOY) clock offset
<BR>
from the real year by, if I recall correctly, 48 years.  It does
<BR>
this because the SRM console firmware will screw around with the
<BR>
hardware TOY clock (e.g., to try to adjust it between OpenVMS and
<BR>
Windows NT formats, or if the looser uses the console's set time
<BR>
command), and UNIX needs to be able to tell whether it's valid, as
<BR>
UNIX has other ways to manipulate it (e.g., retrieve a possibly
<BR>
good value from the boot blocks on the boot disk).
<BR>
<P>Anyway, if Tru64 UNIX is maintaining the TOY clock and Alpha Linux
<BR>
isn't using anything except the hardware clock and is assuming that
<BR>
the year field is &quot;real&quot;, it's going to see 2047 (in 1999) or 2048
<BR>
(in 2000) as the year.
<BR>
<P>This, of course, is resolved by using a network time service to set
<BR>
the clock during boot..
<BR>
<P>--------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>I will update the list if a &quot;better&quot; solution is found for those who
<BR>
want to dual-boot their Alpha.

Subject: boot from SRM &amp; system date [ update ]
<BR>
<P><P>Hello,
<BR>
<P>On Thu, 13 Jan 2000, I wrote:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; today I installed linux (RH 6.1) on an alcor system (AlphaStation 600
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 5/333). Mostly it works right except for system date. It seems that linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; takes wrong UNIX epoch from SRM. date shows some date in 2068, which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exactly one epoch (2**31 secs) too late.
</EM><BR>
<P>The information above is note entirely correct. The behaviour is a bit
<BR>
different: it gets the seconds, minuted, hours, day and month correct,
<BR>
only the year is incorrect. It thinks we are in 2047.
<BR>
<P>It seems to calculate the epoch later and since the year is wrong (and in
<BR>
next UNIX epoch, which starts sometime in 2038), the epoch is also wrong.
<BR>
It still holds what I wrote about ntp:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; BTW, if I run ntpdate, it corrects clock by some seconds, so it seems that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it doesn't know about epoch.
</EM><BR>
<P>Does anybody else have similar problems. Any solution other than seting
<BR>
the correct date/time in linux and then writing it back to SRM?
<BR>
<P>Peace!
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mkx
<BR>
<P>---- perl -e 'print
<BR>
$i=pack(c5,(41*2),sqrt(7056),(unpack(c,H)-2),oct(115),10);'
