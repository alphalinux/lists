Hi everybody,
<BR>
<P>I am having a problem benchmarking the L2 cache performance on some
<BR>
Alpha 21264 systems from our clusters and wondering if anybody else
<BR>
has seen this. We use a benchmark that models the kernel of our main
<BR>
application (computational physics/lattice gauge theory). When running
<BR>
in L1 cache or beyond L2 cache, it gives perfectly consistent readings
<BR>
with deviations of 1% or less. But in L2 cache, the numbers from
<BR>
different runs may be off by as much as 20%, for which I cannot find a
<BR>
good explanation. If I plot performance vs. memory footprint, there is
<BR>
a clear shoulder from the L1 cache (64 KB), but then a kind of
<BR>
logarithmic behavior (double the memory use loses 30 MFlops).
<BR>
<P>The benchmark consists of a completely deterministic set of
<BR>
floating-point operations, and I use a version that accesses memory
<BR>
completely consecutively. The systems are Compaq DS10 (466 MHz single
<BR>
proc.), ES40 (666 MHz 4-proc.), and API UP2000 (666 MHz dbl. proc.)
<BR>
under Linux. I did not see this effect under Tru64 on a XP1000 (666
<BR>
MHz single proc.).
<BR>
<P>The question is: Is there anything either in Linux or the 21264 that
<BR>
could account for such behavior? Could the cache be polluted by other
<BR>
processes that effectively? (The machines were basically idle during
<BR>
benchmarks).
<BR>
<P>In particular, it seems that code running just inside the L2 cache (4
<BR>
MB on the UP2000 and ES40) is not performing much better than code in
<BR>
main memory, which would be a pity. We expect cache performance to be
<BR>
a major determinant of total performance for our application: in L1
<BR>
cache, the performance is about 600 MFlops, outside L2 cache it drops
<BR>
to about 200 MFlops. Inside L2 it varies between 300 and 450 MFlops.
<BR>
<P>Thanks
<BR>
