Hi all,
<BR>
<P>Earlier I posted a message to this list, saying that I had some problems
<BR>
using a QLogic SCSI card and a Dolphin PCI-SCI card on the same PCI bus.
<BR>
The system I used was a Compaq DS-10 466MHz (Tsunami chipset)
<BR>
<P>Recently I got a DP264 with two 667MHz EV67's (still Tsunami chipset).
<BR>
The motherboard has an onboard Adaptec 7890 (64 bit) SCSI controller
<BR>
attached to PCI bus 0 (On this system there are two Pchips).
<BR>
<P>If the Doplhin PCI-SCI card was in the same PCI bus as the SCSI chip the
<BR>
system wouldn't boot (the SCSI driver just looped in resetting the SCSI
<BR>
bus). When I moved the PCI-SCI card to the other bus the problem
<BR>
disappeared, but on this bus there was also a Ethernet card (a 3com
<BR>
Cyclone card) and sometimes I experienced lockups.
<BR>
<P>The Dolphin PCI-SCI card contains a chip called a PSB (PCI-SCI Bridge)
<BR>
wich is connected to the PCI bus. This chip is reported as a
<BR>
PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_OTHER (0x680). The function of the SCI card is to 'map'
<BR>
remote memory (memory on another machine) to local adresses, so that you
<BR>
can read from and write to the remote machine (a very efficient way of
<BR>
Message passing +120MB/s). Thus the PSB chip has two Memory regions in
<BR>
PCI space, one small for CSR accesses, and one large (typically 256MB)
<BR>
for remote memory access.
<BR>
<P>So, here is the problem:
<BR>
<P>When the machine is powered on, the Dolphin SCI card gets a PCI base
<BR>
address for the large memory region from SRM which is 0x40000000 (1GB).
<BR>
Since this device reports as a PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_OTHER, the base address
<BR>
is not changed when the Linux Kernel does a bus layout (in bios32.c).
<BR>
<P>The base address set up by SRM (0x40000000) is the same address as the
<BR>
DMA window used when PCI devices shall access physical memory on the
<BR>
Tsunami chipset. Thus when PCI devices try to access physical memory
<BR>
matching the size and base of the SCI card (physical memory range 0 -
<BR>
256MB), i.e ethernet chips accessing skb_buffers and SCSI cards
<BR>
transferring data, the PCI -&gt; memory access is actually redirected to
<BR>
the Dolphin SCI card. This is the reson for all my lockups.
<BR>
<P>I have patched the 2.2.14 kernel in bios32.c (attached) to do a device
<BR>
layout even on devices reported as PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_OTHER, so that I
<BR>
avoid the problem. My question is then, should this patch go into the
<BR>
original kernel source ??? I think it should.
<BR>
<P>Another issue is the 2.4 kernel, I have not tested with this kernel, but
<BR>
from what I've seen I think it should be OK.
<BR>
<P>Best Regards
<BR>
