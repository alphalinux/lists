<P>Actually, the rules under POSIX are fairly clear. Assuming a signal
<BR>
was caused by a thread inside a give n process, the signal should be
<BR>
delivered to that thread. The only case where any of a group of
<BR>
threads could receive a signal is in the even that an external process
<BR>
sends a signal to a process using kill. In this case the delivery of
<BR>
the signal is influenced by the signal masks of each of the threads.

<EM>&gt; I've been doing threads for a long time, dating back to Cray's first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; version of Unicos.  I found that signals are simply something to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; completely avoided if threads are being used.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is not entirely fair. Certainly, lots of things that are done via
<BR>
signals in single-thread models don't map so well in multi-thread
<BR>
models (and indeed are better done in the first place using threads
<BR>
and blocking), but signals have a very valid place in a threaded
<BR>
environment, if for no other reason than a threaded program should
<BR>
still be able to respond to SIGINT. ;-)
<BR>
<P>Certainly it's not easy to provide a good interface to signals in a
<BR>
threaded environment, but it can and has been done. Linux's
<BR>
implementation isn't exactly perfect yet, but it's getting there.
