Hi again,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as you may remember from my last post, we recently bought a
<BR>
couple of Multias.  We're trying to install debian on these machines, on a
<BR>
9gb scsi drive, however these systems do not have floppy drives in them.
<BR>
It has been possible to boot the machine over the network, however we have
<BR>
had no luck with doing much with it.  The netboot worked fine, then
<BR>
mounted it's rootdisk over NFS, but failed to do a number of things due to
<BR>
missing features in the kernel (loopback, etc).
<BR>
<P>So a new kernel was cross-compiled, and we've got a vmlinux.gz file with
<BR>
what we need, however milo refuses to boot this kernel.
<BR>
<P>Firstly, I'm wondering if there is a howto anywhere around which explains
<BR>
how to boot a machine and install on it, without a floppy drive?
<BR>
<P>Secondly, is there anything special you need to do to make milo use a
<BR>
vmlinux.gz file?  We're currently playing with aboot, but if we can get
<BR>
milo to work it would be useful.
<BR>
<P>Thirdly, can anyone tell me where to get a tool to make the vmlinux file
<BR>
net-bootable?  There must be a tool out there somewhere to do it, since
<BR>
we've got a pre-made image which is net-bootable.  Anyone know what/where
<BR>
it is?
<BR>
<P>Thanks in advance for any help you can offer.
<BR>
<P>Davey
