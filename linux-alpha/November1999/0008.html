<EM>&gt; The de4x5 driver sounded promising.  I neglected to think about that

<EM>&gt; because redhat had given me the tulip driver in conf.modules during
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the install.  Alas, things seem to be worse with the de4x5 -- I get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no activity at all and a &quot;network unreachable&quot; message even when I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ping dagmar, which is the alpha.  I have the source for a slightly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; later de4x5, but the changelog doesn't sound promising.

<P>Hmmm...I've been having a similar problem with some ES40s.  When they
<BR>
first boot up and try to ping them I get a &quot;network unreachable&quot; as
<BR>
well.  The strange part is, if I telnet to them I can get there and
<BR>
after I do that I can ping them as well.  I'm not sure what it could
<BR>
be.  I think I was having the same problem on the ES40s with the tulip
<BR>
dirver as well.  All with the stock drivers in the 2.2.10 kernel.  If
<BR>
I have time, maybe I'll see if I can put some diagnostics in the
<BR>
driver and see if I can figure out what the problem is.
<BR>
<P>One thing that I found on the Miata is that once in a while the
<BR>
networking would fail and come back.  I couldn't find anything in the
<BR>
logs.  When this happens, if I unload the module and load it again it
<BR>
would be fixed immediately.  Of course, if you do this you lose all
<BR>
the open connections you had.
<BR>
<P>If you can figure out the problem, let me know how to solve it.
