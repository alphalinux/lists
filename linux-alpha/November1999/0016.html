<P>I don't know the details of how it works, just what I've observed.  If
<BR>
you run the Alpha machine under Alpha BIOS mode (usually for NT), then
<BR>
they will scan for x86 BIOS controllers and execute it with x86
<BR>
emulation.  I have an Adaptec SCSI controller on my Miata which has no
<BR>
support for Alpha built into, but when I'm running in the Alpha BIOS
<BR>
mode I can boot from it.  If I try to use SRM BIOS, the card is never
<BR>
seen and I can't boot from a device attached to it.  I assume you want
<BR>
to make your controller work under SRM as well as Alpha BIOS.  I would
<BR>
expect that you need to get in touch with Compaq to get specs on how
<BR>
SRM works.
