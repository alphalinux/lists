Hi All,
<BR>
<P>For EV6 based systems, booting from SRM is all this is recommended
<BR>
by Compaq.  The publicly available installation guide (which is updated
<BR>
very regularly) only talks about SRM installs and booting.
<BR>
<P>You can find this doc here, but be sure to check back before any
<BR>
new install to be sure you have the latest.  It contains install info
<BR>
for various distributions:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.digital.com/alphaserver/linux/install_guide.html">http://www.digital.com/alphaserver/linux/install_guide.html</A>
<BR>
<P>And for hardware docs, check here:

<BR>
<P>Enjoy,
<BR>
<P>Tim
<BR>
<P>Compaq Computer (realize I am an engineer who enjoys linux, but
<BR>
am not part of the official group who oversees any of these systems
<BR>
or docs.)
<BR>
<P>PS: Be sure to get the RH 6.0 Alpha updates or various pieces will 
<BR>
not work on your EV6 system (like some network stuff, etc).

<P><EM>&gt; I don't know the details of how it works, just what I've observed.  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you run the Alpha machine under Alpha BIOS mode (usually for NT), then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they will scan for x86 BIOS controllers and execute it with x86
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; emulation.  I have an Adaptec SCSI controller on my Miata which has no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support for Alpha built into, but when I'm running in the Alpha BIOS
</EM><BR>
<P>OK.  
<BR>
<P>I have a DS20 here and a RedHat-6.0 (Hedwig - Alpha) CD here.
<BR>
In the document &quot;Red Hat Linux 6.0 - Alpha installation Addendum&quot;
<BR>
(doc/alpha/booklet/doc001.htm) which came in the CD, it talks about
<BR>
Alpha
<BR>
BIOS boot-up only through MILO.  
<BR>
My questions are :  Can Alpha BIOS boot happen only through MILO?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a MILO for DS20?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; mode I can boot from it.  If I try to use SRM BIOS, the card is never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seen and I can't boot from a device attached to it.  I assume you want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to make your controller work under SRM as well as Alpha BIOS.  I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expect that you need to get in touch with Compaq to get specs on how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SRM works.
</EM><BR>
<P>I could not find any links to specs or docs in <A HREF="http://www.compaq.com.">http://www.compaq.com.</A>
<BR>
Any idea where to get specs from?
