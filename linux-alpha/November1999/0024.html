<EM>&gt;          as you may remember from my last post, we recently bought a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;couple of Multias.  We're trying to install debian on these machines, on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;9gb scsi drive, however these systems do not have floppy drives in them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It has been possible to boot the machine over the network, however we have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;had no luck with doing much with it.  The netboot worked fine, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mounted it's rootdisk over NFS, but failed to do a number of things due to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;missing features in the kernel (loopback, etc).
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm...I've successfully made both Red Hat and Debian boot floppy kernels
<BR>
work with MILO, although the Red Hat floppies required major surgery
<BR>
(none of which required anything that you don't get with Windows95 and
<BR>
a Red Hat CD) before they would co-operate.  This was enough to use the
<BR>
Multia to rebuild a kernel, although this takes more than four hours
<BR>
per attempt and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
<BR>
<P>My Multia has only a floppy drive, no hard disk.  I've never made network
<BR>
booting work (root-on-NFS works, of course, but not kernel-over-TFTP or
<BR>
anything like it).
<BR>
<P>Does your Multia have an ARC console?  You might be able to get away
<BR>
with pre-loading the hard disk on an i386 machine.  ARC boots off of
<BR>
a MS-DOS partition with a normal Windows NT/Alpha executable (MILO)
<BR>
that can be loaded by ARC.  From MILO you can load the kernel from any
<BR>
ext2/MS-DOS/iso9660 partition or drive, and from there you can do...well,
<BR>
anything you like.  ;-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Secondly, is there anything special you need to do to make milo use a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;vmlinux.gz file?  We're currently playing with aboot, but if we can get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;milo to work it would be useful.
</EM><BR>
<P>As long as the file name ends in '.gz' I think MILO should be able to
<BR>
handle this automagically.  The '.gz' may not even be necessary, either.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Thirdly, can anyone tell me where to get a tool to make the vmlinux file
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;net-bootable?  There must be a tool out there somewhere to do it, since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we've got a pre-made image which is net-bootable.  Anyone know what/where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it is?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd like to know too.  ;-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Thanks in advance for any help you can offer.
