Without Getting Killed or Going Broke

<BR>
<P>This book is an essential guide for the seasoned dating
<BR>
man who needs help organizing the women in his life.
<BR>
Women are constantly grabbing your interest and attention.
<BR>
Do you have to choose on over the other? Of Course not!
<BR>
Stop letting opportunities like these go to waste.
<BR>
Why not date them all?
<BR>
<P>This is a must-read for men who are active on the dating
<BR>
scene. Not only will you learn how to juggle several
<BR>
females at a time, you will also improve your overall
<BR>
chances with women, including where to meet them and
<BR>
how to do the little things to keep them happy.
<BR>
<P>You will learn time-saving techniques that will maximize
<BR>
your availability, and allow you to spend time with several
<BR>
ladies a day. The author details scheduling methods so you
<BR>
never have two dates at the same time. You will also learn
<BR>
money-saving tips so you can date aggressively and still
<BR>
have money left to buy life's other necessities.
<BR>
<P>Forget the saying,&quot;For every man there is a woman out
<BR>
there.&quot; Now it will be, &quot;For every man there are at
<BR>
least three women.&quot;
