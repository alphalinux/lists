<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh well. So- is it because I have an ancient bootlx that the boot of

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Could be.  Old versions of aboot didn't handle ELF files
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; properly.  It had made some simplifying assumptions that

<EM>&gt;  Matthew wrote he uses aboot from RH 5.2.  This is the same aboot-0.5-7

<EM>&gt; package you created some time ago.  So if there is something wrong with

<EM>&gt; it, there is no newer alternative, AFAIK.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll check. I was actually using aboot-0.5 source from a while back but
<BR>
I'll get the SRPM for aboot-0.5-7 and recheck. I made a bunch of changes
<BR>
to the older aboot-0.5 to get it to compile agains the 2.2.1 kernel, but
<BR>
sadness resulted when a change to increase the number of ext2 groups to
<BR>
cope with seemed to cause it to blow large holes in the filesystem the
<BR>
resultant e2writeboot was run on.
