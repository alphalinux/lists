<EM>&gt; What's this card?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sio0 at pci0 dev 8 function 0: Intel 82378ZB System I/O (SIO) (rev. 0x43)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yep, definitely a PC164.  Wonder why the SRM isn't reporting the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right thing? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Would you annotate get_cpuinfo() to report the numeric sys_variation?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps my ident data is off by one.
</EM><BR>
<P>Booting on EB164 variation EB164 using machine vector EB164 (typ 1a var 4)
<BR>
<P>This is wrong then- the var field only has EMBEDDED CONSOLE set. Looks
<BR>
like we'll need another console command line override for subtype too!
<BR>
<P><P><P>Y'know- I can't remember where the HWRPB systype/field comes from- is this
<BR>
ultimately determined by the PAL code, or by the CONSOLE code loaded
<BR>
inside EV5 at powerup?
<BR>
<P>I'll send along my patches too that will print out the system/variant
<BR>
names that the PAL has set up (dsr_sysname). Later today I'll get around
<BR>
to booting with NetBSD again which uses different PAL code and check to
<BR>
see what the typ/subtype is...
<BR>
<P>I believe I must have ancient PAL code- I'm using the aboot that came with
<BR>
LINUX RH5.2, which about-0.5 with whatever (2.0.35?) bootlx that comes
<BR>
with. This boot block exits right away (halts) when I boot on a rawhide-
<BR>
and isn't this the fella responsible for loading PAL code? So is this
<BR>
bustedness possibly due to old PAL code being used? BTW- I can't build
<BR>
rawboot in 2.2.1 (build fails)- is working in another version?
