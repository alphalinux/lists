<EM>&gt; &gt; I'll check. I was actually using aboot-0.5 source from a while back but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'll get the SRPM for aboot-0.5-7 and recheck. I made a bunch of changes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to the older aboot-0.5 to get it to compile agains the 2.2.1 kernel, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sadness resulted when a change to increase the number of ext2 groups to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cope with seemed to cause it to blow large holes in the filesystem the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; resultant e2writeboot was run on.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Well, I made changes to allow aboot to be compiled in 2.1.x Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environment in May 1998.  Since then the pointers to updated SRPM packages
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of aboot appeared on <A HREF="mailto:axp-linux@redhat.com?subject=Re:%20(PROBLEM%20SOLVED)%20Re:%20restore%20to%20srm%20that%20doesn't....">axp-linux@redhat.com</A> for several times.

<P>axp-linux? An alias it seems to be impossible to get subscribed to...
