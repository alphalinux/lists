<P>i've just implemented this (free preemption of pre-specified kernel areas)
<BR>
and it's really simple, and appears to work nicely both in the UP and SMP
<BR>
case.
<BR>
<P>There is a single current-&gt;may_preempt counter which is typically zero. If
<BR>
the counter is non-zero, then the IRQ return path may preempt the process.
<BR>
The counter is recursive (unused feature currently but same cost), and is
<BR>
used in uaccess.h when the memcpy is non-constant (probably big enough.
<BR>
It's cheaper to unconditionally do the incl+decl than checking for memcpy
<BR>
size). Note that 'current' is already cached in 99% of these cases because
<BR>
we already did an access_ok() check for the user-space copy, which
<BR>
accessed current-&gt;addr_limit. The counter is persistent and present even
<BR>
if the process is non-running - the 'may preempt' property of the task
<BR>
does not depend on wether it's running. (This method differs from Andrea's
<BR>
similar 'all-inclusive' method by having a clean per-process counter.)
<BR>
<P>i've also introduced a new light-weight 'IRQ-atomic' increment and
<BR>
decrement method in atomic.h, because -&gt;may_preempt has to be
<BR>
local-IRQ-safe.
<BR>
<P>the IRQ return path in entry.S now checks wether:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) -&gt;need_resched or -&gt;pending is set
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and 2) wether we return to non-IRQ context
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and 3) -&gt;allow_preempt is set.
<BR>
<P>the entry.S IRQ return path got one more conditional instruction, which
<BR>
checks for need_resched and moves into the 'we might preempt even
<BR>
kernel-space' path. This branch comes _after_ checking all the common
<BR>
cases: return-to-userspace and no-event-pending. I believe this is pretty
<BR>
much the cheapest way we can get away with this. (The patch does not allow
<BR>
processing signal handlers though, only reschedules - that would be a
<BR>
security hole in certain cases, correct?)
<BR>
<P>the uaccess.h changes are safe because we can reschedule even with the
<BR>
kernel lock held, but it's illegal to call any of the user-copy routines
<BR>
with spinlocks held. (There are some other places that we want to make
<BR>
preemptible as well, but i first wanted to have this simple prototype.)
<BR>
<P>the patch gets some non-obvious cases right as well: if a cross-IPI marks
<BR>
the process need_resched==1 then we might reschedule immediately if it
<BR>
hits a big memcpy.
<BR>
<P>i've tested the patch (against pre-2.3.52-1) and it compiles both UP and
<BR>
SMP, and i've tested it under load on SMP - appears to be stable. Have i
<BR>
missed anything, and is this what we want?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you really want hard realtime, go to work with Victor and RTLinux..
</EM><BR>
<P>(yep.)
