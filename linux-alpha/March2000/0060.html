<EM>&gt; We want to avoid having long latencies, and we can easily get that by just

<EM>&gt; allowing timer interrupts to schedule which we're in a big

<EM>&gt; &quot;memcpy_to_user()&quot; and we don't hold any kernel lock etc. No need to try

<P>Ingo's bog standard low-latency patch is already said to do a fine job
<BR>
down to 0.5ms or so, and it does what you suggest.
<BR>
<P>The problem remains with various bits of code that aren't audited for
<BR>
low latency (there will always be some).  Drivers that spend ages in a
<BR>
loop (see recent fbcon thread for example).  Random bits of
<BR>
uninteresting vfs or mm code that haven't been examined.
<BR>
<P>These off-the-map issues are designed to address that stuff.  To do what
<BR>
the low latency patch does, but guarantee it works everywhere.  Assuming
<BR>
none of the unaudited code holds a spinlock for ages.
<BR>
<P>So you can have a high priority thread that can process audio in real
<BR>
time (for example), or a softmodem user space driver (other completely
<BR>
random example).  Note that RTLinux isn't really suitable for those --
<BR>
RTLinux isolates the real time process too much.  And super-hard isn't
<BR>
required for those applications anyway.
<BR>
<P>You suggestion of timer interrupts would actually be good enough for
<BR>
audio and softmodem apps, if you crank up the timer to 1kHz.  So would
<BR>
the device interrupts probably.
<BR>
<P>But the idea of only preempting during memcpy_to_user isn't enough --
<BR>
some code loops for ages and it's not doing memcpy_to_user.
