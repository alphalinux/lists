<EM>&gt; In contrast, the other approaches have either made spinlocks slower on

<EM>&gt; simple, but would not show how the latency of filename lookup is still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to be noticeable. But eventually we'll have a fully threaded dcache,

<EM>&gt; and issues like that go away on their own if just designed right.

<P>ok, i understand. What i find inconsistent is the way we 'punish' the SMP
<BR>
kernel with this method. A dual-CPU system would be worse at handling
<BR>
latencies than a UP kernel. Yes, two CPUs are less likely to be in a
<BR>
latency-critical section at once, but under certain (typical) workloads
<BR>
it's going to be pretty often - and nobody is going to care because most
<BR>
people will have the nicely preemptable UP kernel. The latency-quality of
<BR>
the SMP kernel will be much worse than the UP kernel's latency.
<BR>
<P>our SMP spinlocks are very short and localized now in 90% of the cases,
<BR>
basically only maybe some of the filesystem code and fork() is within the
<BR>
big kernel lock. But we still do execute in kernel-space without hitting a
<BR>
preemption point for many millisecs, and on SMP with lots of RAM the
<BR>
probability of having such code paths increases. I just find it hard to
<BR>
accept such wildly different characteristics - SMP should be _better_ at
<BR>
handling latencies, not worse. Should i boot an UP kernel if i want to
<BR>
listen music at an acceptable quality and still sometimes do serious work?
<BR>
It just takes one skip per minute under normal workload (or during kernel
<BR>
compiles, or whatever non-idle situation) and users quickly think the OS
<BR>
sucks multimedia-wise.
<BR>
<P>i do see the advantage as well: testing on UP automatically tests some
<BR>
(most) of the SMP characteristics as well.
<BR>
<P>i also accept the fact that UP and SMP _are_ different, and we should not
<BR>
be surprised if the architecture diverges over time. I just did not
<BR>
anticipate such a direction :-)
