<EM>&gt; &gt; Agreed, but what is the point of it? Now every spinlock has to look up

<EM>&gt; &gt; the unlock case) suddenly became 5 or more. No, thank you. Especially as I

<EM>&gt; &gt; don't believe it buys you anything on SMP.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Only i386, arm and sh need to look up current and on all other

<EM>&gt; and keep as an option, you don't want that on servers of course, where

<EM>&gt; throughput is far more important, but if want to play qua^H^H^Hmp3s...

<P>I don't think people understand.
<BR>
<P>I WILL NOT APPLY THE PATCHES I'VE SEEN SO FAR.
<BR>
<P>They suck. Sorry, Ingo.
<BR>
<P>They add new infrastructure to do something that the SMP code has been
<BR>
doing for ages. I consider them ugly. They buy you nothing that wouldn't
<BR>
be cleanly done by my simple suggestion, and my simple suggestion gets it
<BR>
right in GENERAL, not in the few special cases that Ingo's code handled.
<BR>
<P>There are absolutely no advantages to doing it the stupid way. So why do
<BR>
it that way, then?
<BR>
<P>Using the existing spin_lock()/lock_kernel() infrastructure means that
<BR>
&nbsp;- the locks get verified on UP, and it makes peopleaware of what the cost
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of lock_kernel() is on both UP =and= SMP. Imagine extending the current
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;profiling code trivially to show very clearly where interrupts happen
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;during active spinlocks - it would be very efficient at pinpointing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;code that runs under lock_kernel and causes latency degradation.
<BR>
&nbsp;- the UP kernel is threaded in all the same places the SMP kernel is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;threaded, not just in a few special cases.
<BR>
&nbsp;- you do not introduce any new forms of threading.
<BR>
<P>And it's fast and simple. What more can you ask for? Most of the spinlocks
<BR>
are already of the irqsaving kind which would be complete no-ops in my
<BR>
version of the threading code.
<BR>
<P>In contrast, the other approaches have either made spinlocks slower on
<BR>
SMP, or have added special cases around special code. Ingo's patch is
<BR>
simple, but would not show how the latency of filename lookup is still
<BR>
going to be noticeable. But eventually we'll have a fully threaded dcache,
<BR>
and issues like that go away on their own if just designed right.
<BR>
<P>I do not like the notion of introducing new concepts that aren't really
<BR>
even needed as far as I can tell.
