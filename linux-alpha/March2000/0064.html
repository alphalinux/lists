<P><EM>&gt; NOTE NOTE NOTE! You must NOT change the SMP case at all, including the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;are we in the kernel&quot; test. Not only do we not have a global
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spinlock_count (and we don't want one - it would be cache-line death),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but even if we used the above heuristic it would be seriously wrong on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SMP, because it would mean that anything that caches the value of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;current CPU&quot; would need to lock. Which is just too expensive to even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think about, because it happens all over the place. On UP, that just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't a problem ;)
</EM><BR>
<P>oops, i missed that indeed, darn. Hm., there are not all that many such
<BR>
places though, and the value itself is cached in current-&gt;processor anyway
<BR>
(and 'current' can be cached across reschedules). I cannot see any easy
<BR>
way to avoid this bug in any 'automatic' way though. How can we prevent
<BR>
writing a 'semi-constant' to a local variable, possibly at compile-time?
<BR>
<P>The impact seems to be moderate i believe: out of 1150 driver-modules only
<BR>
5 use smp_processor_id() directly. I've checked all these places and none
<BR>
of them is unsafe (smp_processor_id() is never saved to the stack). I've
<BR>
also checked the networking code which uses smp_processor_id() in some
<BR>
places, and only a small amount of code would break: netif_rx saves it to
<BR>
a local variable and while it's mostly called from IRQ contexts, it can be
<BR>
called from syscall level as well. Most other places use
<BR>
smp_processor_id() under some spinlock. But yes, these would be subtle
<BR>
bugs if unfixed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There probably are numerous nasty small details that would crop up, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd give it a 15% chance of just working on the first try.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Oh, and it's not going to be really really efficient. It's going to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increment and decrement global_spinlock_count a lot more than strictly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; necessary, but any &quot;clever&quot; approach is just going to be too painful to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think about, and would make the UP locking too different from the SMP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; case.
</EM><BR>
<P>hm, current-&gt;spinlock_depth should work pretty well i believe, no? That
<BR>
one is SMP-safe as well. It doesnt have any global cacheline problems
<BR>
either.
