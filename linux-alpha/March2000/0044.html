<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; Having said this, i now do agree that doing a preemptible kernel (which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; the Linux SMP kernel could become with a small amount of work) is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; superior solution to this, wrt. latencies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ingo, how do you plan to handle the by-hand locks? You can trivially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forbid rescheduling as soon as you have a spin_lock() held, but how do you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; handle code that uses a spinlock to serialize the accesses to a lock?
</EM><BR>
<P>well, such code has to be fixed/changed. There are other (i believe
<BR>
nastier) cases as well: rescheduling processes holding critical
<BR>
semaphores. All the lock inversion scenarios pop up full force in a
<BR>
preemptible kernel :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And since most of the stuff needs some kind of serialization it also mean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for most of syscalls you are going to reschedule in the ret_from_syscall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stage anyway as now.
</EM><BR>
<P>yep - a preemptible kernel does impact performance, no doubt about it. But
<BR>
the real cost is in the UP kernel: spinlocks are not a no-op with
<BR>
preemtible kernels anymore. (this can be helped with, but it's still
<BR>
additional code)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think one of the only interesting places for the preemtable kernel is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; copy user stuff that will effectivly be rescheduled as soon as it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; necessary.
</EM><BR>
<P>i'm not sure. Basically we have moved away from unbound copies, so i doubt
<BR>
any code in the kernel does more than a 64k copy at once to/from
<BR>
user-space. The typical copy is not bigger than 4k. So an explicit
<BR>
preemption point does help.
<BR>
<P>A 'fully preemtive' kernel is almost certainly a loss for typical systems,
<BR>
but it's quite useful for RT applications. (it might also be useful for
<BR>
interactive applications, although we are pretty good already with the
<BR>
lowlatency-patch.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But now by thinking at that stuff I have an idea! Why instead of making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the kernel preemtable we take the other way around? So why instead of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; having to forbid scheduling in locked regions, we don't simply allow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rescheduling in some piece of code that we know that will benefit by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; preemtable thing?
</EM><BR>
<P>this is way too ugly and non-generic. You are completely missing the
<BR>
point. uaccess.h latencies are _not_ the problem.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That's all. Then we'll have copu_user preemtable with a few lines of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changes. I'll try that immediatly :).
</EM><BR>
<P>Andrea, please think first and do not duplicate work done by others. A
<BR>
preemtive kernel is _not_ an issue unless you are into RT applications
<BR>
which need 100 usec-type latencies. A current kernel's interactive
<BR>
performance is already good enough to never show up in interactive
<BR>
applications. Those few multimedia applications which need 0.5ms-ish
<BR>
latencies are helped by the lowlatency patch.
