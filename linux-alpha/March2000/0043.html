<P>I think Ingo meant &quot;without rescheduling more often than what we expected

while looking the scheduler code&quot;.
<BR>
<P>The lowlatency patch simply adds the equivalent of:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (current-&gt;need_resched)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;schedule();
<BR>
<P>in places that are used to run for a long time without rescheduling
<BR>
in-between. This way the scheduler decisions gets effective immediatly
<BR>
and not after the lots of time.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Having said this, i now do agree that doing a preemptible kernel (which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; the Linux SMP kernel could become with a small amount of work) is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; superior solution to this, wrt. latencies.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ingo, how do you plan to handle the by-hand locks? You can trivially
<BR>
forbid rescheduling as soon as you have a spin_lock() held, but how do you
<BR>
handle code that uses a spinlock to serialize the accesses to a lock?
<BR>
<P>Suppose this is the kernel code (it's silly code I know but it's just to
<BR>
give you the idea of what we'll get wrong):
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;static int lock;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;again:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while (lock);
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spin_lock(&amp;serialize_me);
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (lock) {
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spin_unlock(&amp;serialize_me);
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goto again;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lock = 1;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spin_unlock(&amp;serialize_me);
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mb();
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do stuff
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------------- rescheduled by preemptive kernel
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mb();
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lock = 0;
<BR>
<P>Another task grabs the lock while the task that is holding the lock is
<BR>
been rescheduled, and so the other task hangs in while(lock); for
<BR>
200msec!! This means very bad performance. So there may be very bad
<BR>
performance side effects all over the place in making the kernel
<BR>
preemptable. The whole section should be marked as non preemptable or the
<BR>
first while(lock); should be replaced with while(lock) if
<BR>
(current-&gt;need_resched) schedule(). With a non preemptable kernel the
<BR>
schedule() wasn't necessary for good performance because the behaviour we
<BR>
wanted was not to reschedule and we known if somebody was helding the
<BR>
lock, that lock was going to be released very soon (faster than a
<BR>
reschedule). And running the critical section without reschedule in
<BR>
between is also the right thing to do for most fast locks to avoid
<BR>
wasting CPU in poing pongs in the scheduler.
<BR>
<P>And since most of the stuff needs some kind of serialization it also mean
<BR>
for most of syscalls you are going to reschedule in the ret_from_syscall
<BR>
stage anyway as now.
<BR>
<P>I think one of the only interesting places for the preemtable kernel is
<BR>
copy user stuff that will effectivly be rescheduled as soon as it's
<BR>
necessary.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Well, to start, it would violate Linus' rule, an old UNIX rule, and your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;new IRQ scheme makes it more complex -- you have to make sure to not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;switch out of tasks that are handling unacked interrupts. 
</EM><BR>
<P>The irq scheme is not involved at all (except we would have to forbid the
<BR>
try-to-reschedule in the case we got an interrupt nested in another irq as
<BR>
we now we are forbidding the reschedule if the irq happened on top of
<BR>
kernel code).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I don't know how to trade throughput for latency without losing throughput.
</EM><BR>
<P>With the fact we'll have to bloat the fast path (a fast lock like the
<BR>
above one and all the spinlocks will need an additional
<BR>
forbid_preempt(smp_processor_id()) the preemtable kernel it's not likely
<BR>
to be a win.
<BR>
<P>The latency will decrease without drpping throughtput only in code that
<BR>
runs for long time with none lock held like the copy_user stuff. That
<BR>
stuff will run at the same speed as now but with zero scheduler latency.
<BR>
<P>The _lose_ instead will happen in _all_ the code that grabs any kind of
<BR>
spinlock because spin_lock/spin_unlock will be slower and the latency
<BR>
won't decrease for that stuff.
<BR>
<P><P>But now by thinking at that stuff I have an idea! Why instead of making
<BR>
the kernel preemtable we take the other way around? So why instead of
<BR>
having to forbid scheduling in locked regions, we don't simply allow
<BR>
rescheduling in some piece of code that we know that will benefit by the
<BR>
preemtable thing?
<BR>
<P>The kernel won't be preemtable this way (so we'll keep throughtput in the
<BR>
locking fast path) but we could mark special section of kernel like the
<BR>
copy user as preemtable.
<BR>
<P>It will be quite easy:
<BR>
<P>static atomic_t cpu_preemtable[NR_CPUS] = { [0..NR_CPUS] = ATOMIC_INIT(0), };
<BR>
<P>#define preemtable_copy_user(...) \
<BR>
do { \
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;atomic_inc(&amp;cpu_preemtable[smp_processor_id()]); \
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copy_user(...); \
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;atomic_dec(&amp;cpu_preemtable[smp_processor_id()]); \
<BR>
} while (0)
<BR>
<P>Then the only thing we'll have to change is the irq return path where we
<BR>
now are are doing:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (we are _not_ running on top of the kernel)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reschedule();
<BR>
<P>Now it will have to be:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (we are _not_ running on top of the kernel ||
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;atomic_read(&amp;cpu_preemtable[smp_processor_id()]))
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reschedule();
<BR>
<P>That's all. Then we'll have copu_user preemtable with a few lines of
<BR>
changes. I'll try that immediatly :).
