<EM>&gt; &gt; isn't a problem ;)

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; oops, i missed that indeed, darn. Hm., there are not all that many such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; places though, and the value itself is cached in current-&gt;processor anyway
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (and 'current' can be cached across reschedules). I cannot see any easy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way to avoid this bug in any 'automatic' way though. How can we prevent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; writing a 'semi-constant' to a local variable, possibly at compile-time?
</EM><BR>
<P>Solution: don't do it, then.
<BR>
<P>There is pretty much no point in making the SMP case be &quot;threaded&quot; in
<BR>
this sense.
<BR>
<P>Threaded kernels are WAAAY overvalued. I did not agree with the
<BR>
low-latency patches because I thought they were ugly for no real gain. I
<BR>
_would_ agree to the UP-case only thing, simply because it uses the SMP
<BR>
locking that already exists, and extends it in a simple way to the UP case
<BR>
(&quot;threading&quot; a UP box by making the scheduling consider one CPU as a
<BR>
special case of multiple CPU's).
<BR>
<P>Threading the SMP case is simply not worth it. With two CPU's you already
<BR>
get the benefit of threading across CPU's instead of across &quot;time&quot;, to the
<BR>
degree that the small added advantage of anything else is not worth it.
<BR>
Really.
<BR>
<P>Don't even try to thread the SMP case. I wouldn't accept the patches
<BR>
anyway.
<BR>
<P>Also, don't try to be clever about the UP case. I would not accept patches
<BR>
that do what you suggested
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thread_avoid();
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__spin_lock(x);
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__spin_lock(y);
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__spin_unlock(y);
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__spin_unlock(x);
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thread_unavoid();
<BR>
<P>because that defeats the whole process of using the SMP locking for the UP
<BR>
case, and that's a slippery slope. Soon enough people will start trying to
<BR>
be clever, and that's just too horrible to contemplate.
<BR>
<P>Getting nested locks is expensive. If people are aware of that expense
<BR>
even on UP, all the better. Don't fight it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; hm, current-&gt;spinlock_depth should work pretty well i believe, no? That
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one is SMP-safe as well. It doesnt have any global cacheline problems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; either.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed, but what is the point of it? Now every spinlock has to look up
<BR>
current. The nice spinlock code that used to be 2 instructions (or 1 for
<BR>
the unlock case) suddenly became 5 or more. No, thank you. Especially as I
<BR>
don't believe it buys you anything on SMP.
