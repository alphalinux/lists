<EM>&gt; &gt; yep, of course. It's a grave error to schedule during IRQ contexts, and we

<EM>&gt; I think you mean: &quot;of course not&quot;!

<P>[ oops, correct :-) ]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; do have an assert in schedule() so it's plain impossible. The lowlatency
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; patch simply works by increasing the effective frequency (occurance) of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; rescheduling (preemption) points [without actually rescheduling more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; often].
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is too subtle for me. I don't know how you can make true 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the first 2 things without having the third be false.
</EM><BR>
<P>well, the core of it is really simple:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (current-&gt;need_resched)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;schedule();
<BR>
<P>current-&gt;need_resched is rarely set, mostly only if a process is getting
<BR>
preempted by a higher priority process. (which is the case we are
<BR>
interested in)
<BR>
<P>There are two basic cases: there is no 'high priority frequent
<BR>
rescheduler', in which case the above code rarely hits (mostly gets
<BR>
triggered only if some interactive application is used). The other case
<BR>
when there is some latency-sensitive high priority application around - in
<BR>
this case we will likely rescheduler more often, but thats exactly what we
<BR>
were interested in: rescheduling right when the application needs it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Having said this, i now do agree that doing a preemptible kernel (which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the Linux SMP kernel could become with a small amount of work) is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; superior solution to this, wrt. latencies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, to start, it would violate Linus' rule, an old UNIX rule, and your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; new IRQ scheme makes it more complex -- you have to make sure to not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; switch out of tasks that are handling unacked interrupts. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't know how to trade throughput for latency without losing throughput.
</EM><BR>
<P>we would still not switch out of IRQ contexts. IRQ contexts (including
<BR>
softirqs, tasklets and bhs) are supposed to be atomic and time-bound. A
<BR>
preemptive Linux kernel simply does a context switch if 1) -&gt;need_resched
<BR>
is set 2) we return to a non-IRQ context (which can be either user-space
<BR>
or kernel-space). There is nothing magic about this, SMP does not
<BR>
effectively when two processes are running on two CPUs - instructions get
<BR>
mixed up. You can think of SMP Linux running on a dual-CPU box as a 'very
<BR>
fast scheduler', which schedules instructions from 2 processes to the
<BR>
system bus at the instruction level. The fact that we do not do _explicit_
<BR>
kernel-code preemption in SMP mode is just a tiny detail ;-)
