<EM>&gt; So what happens on a uniprocessor when

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;              
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Acks are not vector specific, so does the unacked level irq assert again?
</EM><BR>
<P>Acks _are_ vector specific. It's just that you don't need to specify the
<BR>
vector, because the local APIC knows which one it must be (very simple: it
<BR>
must always be the highest-priority in-service irq).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; BTW: Is it correct to say that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;              ack after a level causes a operation on both local and io-apic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;              ack after an edge is purely local.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If so, what happens with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;              level triggered arrives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;              no-ack dispatch of level trigger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;              higher priority  EDGE arrives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;              ack (intended to ack edge) 
</EM><BR>
<P>The nesting is always ok, because the local APIC knows which interrupts
<BR>
are in service, and thus also knows which one is &quot;active&quot; (the highest
<BR>
priority in-service one).
<BR>
<P>I personally think it's a stupid design (it would be so easy for software
<BR>
to just explicitly say _which_ IRQ to ACK, and I don't see the point of
<BR>
not requireing that and make it explicit), but it's straightforward.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is it now an error to do __sti in interrupt mode?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, why would it be?
<BR>
<P>Doing an __sti in interrupts will let higher-priority interrupts in. As it
<BR>
always has.
<BR>
<P>I think it's probably stupid most of the time, and shows that something is
<BR>
wrong (an interrupt should not take long enough for it to matter that we
<BR>
do an __sti), but sometimes that kind of stupidity is a result of horrible
<BR>
hardware latencies (eg the time it takes to read a sector from the IDE
<BR>
disk using programmed IO).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What happens on 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;              level triggered arrives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;              no-ack dispatch of level trigger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;              timer irq arives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;              ack (intended to ack edge) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;              process switch from timer code.
</EM><BR>
<P>That would be a horrible bug, and would ALWAYS have been a horrible bug.
<BR>
<P>Quite regardless of how you do interrupts: it doesn't matter where youput
<BR>
the ACK's, you always need to make sure that irq masking etc is correct,
<BR>
and you must NOT allow a context switch while an interrupt handler is
<BR>
still running.
<BR>
<P>The kernel _only_ does a process switch on return to user level. That very
<BR>
much includes the case above; the timer interrupt obviously is not
<BR>
returnign to user level.
<BR>
<P>You're making these problems up.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I really dislike hardware interrupt  priorities since they have nothing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to do with the OS' ideas of importance and are complex to work with.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree. I think interrupt controllers should be simple masks, nothing
<BR>
more, nothing less.
<BR>
<P>However, I'm not designing the hardware.
