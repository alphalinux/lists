I've been suckered into^W^W^Wvolunteered to maintaining the official
<BR>
aboot sources, and figured it was high time I made a release, so here
<BR>
it is:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.debian.org/~dhd/aboot/">http://www.debian.org/~dhd/aboot/</A>
<BR>
<P>Once Linuxcare gives me somewhere to put it on their site, I'll
<BR>
probably move it there, either that or to sourceforge...
<BR>
<P>The release notes are in the README.html, so I won't rehash them here.
<BR>
The diff from 0.6 is basically all of Greg Johnson's stuff from the
<BR>
Debian package :)
<BR>
<P>One thing that should be mentioned that is important for distributions
<BR>
to know is that the Red Hat installer-specific code that tried to
<BR>
guess the boot device and appended &quot;bootfile=&quot; and &quot;bootdevice=&quot;
<BR>
parameters to the kernel command line is gone.  The problem was that
<BR>
it basically doesn't work - it could tell you if you were booting from
<BR>
SCSI, IDE, or floppy, but that's about it, and in most cases it would
<BR>
just fall back on /dev/scd0, which is kind of wrong since most alphas
<BR>
these days have IDE CD-ROM drives.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately as far as I can tell, translating the value of the
<BR>
BOOTED_DEV environment variable to a Linux device name is beyond the
<BR>
capabilities of aboot, since the value is system-specific (it requires
<BR>
you to know the layout of the system busses and so forth - so it could
<BR>
probably be done by the kernel).  But I'd like to be proven wrong :)
