<P>Thank you for your time and Interest. This is the letter you've

Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a major 
<BR>
nightly news program recently devoted an
<BR>
Entire show to the investigation of the program described below 
<BR>
to see, if it really can make people money.
<BR>
The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. 
<BR>
Their findings proved once and for
<BR>
All that there are, absolutely no laws prohibiting the

participation in the program. This has helped to

Show people that this is a simple, harmless and fun way to make

<BR>
<P>MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability. It 
<BR>
is being taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford 
<BR>
Research and the Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50% 
<BR>
and 65% of all goods and services will be sold through 
<BR>
multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990's. This is a 
<BR>
Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 500,000 millionaires in 
<BR>
the U.S., 20% (100,000) made their fortune in the last several 
<BR>
years in MLM. Moreover, statistics show 45 people become 
<BR>
millionaires everyday through Multi-Level Marketing.
<BR>
<P>You may have heard this story before, but over the summer Donald 
<BR>
Trump made an appearance on the
<BR>
David Letterman show. Dave asked him what he would do if he lost 
<BR>
everything and had to start over
<BR>
<EM>&gt;From scratch. Without hesitating, Trump said he would find a good 
</EM><BR>
network marketing company and
<BR>
Get to work. The audience started to hoot and boo him. He looked 
<BR>
out at the audience and dead-panned
<BR>
His response &quot;That's why I'm sitting up here and you are all 
<BR>
sitting out there!&quot;
<BR>
<P>With network marketing you have two sources of income. Direct 
<BR>
commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from 
<BR>
sales made by people you introduce to the business.
<BR>
<P>Residual income is the secret of the wealthy. It means investing 
<BR>
time or money once and getting paid
<BR>
Again and again and again. In network marketing, it also means 
<BR>
getting paid for the work of others.
<BR>
<P>The enclosed information is something I almost let slip through 
<BR>
my fingers. Fortunately, sometime later I re-read everything and 
<BR>
gave some thought and study to it.
<BR>
<P>My name is Johnathon Rourke. Two years ago, the corporation I 
<BR>
worked at for the past twelve years
<BR>
Down-sized and my position was eliminated. After unproductive job 
<BR>
interviews, I decided to open my own business. Over the past 
<BR>
year, I incurred many unforeseen financial problems. I owed my 
<BR>
family, friends and creditors over $35,000. The economy was 
<BR>
taking a toll on my business and I just couldn't seem to make 
<BR>
ends meet. I had to refinance and borrow against my home to 
<BR>
support my family and struggling business. 
<BR>
AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened in my life and I am 
<BR>
writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change 
<BR>
your life FOREVER FINANCIALLY!!!
<BR>
<P>In mid December, I received this program via e-mail. Six month's 
<BR>
prior to receiving this program I had been sending away for 
<BR>
information on various business opportunities. All of the 
<BR>
programs I received, in my opinion, were not cost effective. They 
<BR>
were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial 
<BR>
investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work 
<BR>
or not. One claimed that I would make a million dollars in one 
<BR>
year...it didn't tell me I'd have to write a book to make it!
<BR>
<P>But like I was saying, in December of 1997 I received this 
<BR>
program. I didn't send for it, or ask for it,
<BR>
They just got my name off a mailing list. THANK GOODNESS FOR 
<BR>
THAT!!! After reading it several times, to make sure I was 
<BR>
reading it correctly, I couldn't believe my eyes. Here was a 
<BR>
MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON.I could invest as much as I wanted to 
<BR>
start, without putting me further into debt. After I got a pencil 
<BR>
and paper and figured it out, I would at
<BR>
Least gets my money back. But like most of you I was still a 
<BR>
little sceptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of 
<BR>
it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office 
<BR>
(1-800-725-2161 24-hrs) and they confirmed that it is
<BR>
Indeed legal! After determining the program was LEGAL and NOT A 
<BR>
CHAIN LETTER, I decided &quot;WHY NOT.&quot;
<BR>
Initially I sent out 10,000 e-mails. It cost me about $15 for my 
<BR>
time on-line. The great thing about e-mail is that I don't need 
<BR>
any money for printing to send out the program, and because all 
<BR>
of my orders are fulfilled via e-mail, the only expense is my 
<BR>
time. I am telling you like it is, I hope it doesn't turn you 
<BR>
off, but I promised myself that I would not &quot;rip-off&quot; anyone, no 
<BR>
matter how much money it cost me.
<BR>
<P>In less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for 
<BR>
REPORT #1. By January 13, I had received 26 orders for REPORT #1. 
<BR>
Your goal is to &quot;RECEIVE at least 20 ORDERS FOR REPORT #1
<BR>
WITHIN 2 WEEKS. IF YOU DON'T, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU 
<BR>
DO!&quot; My first step in making $50,000 in 90 days was done. By 
<BR>
January 30, I had received 196 orders for REPORT #2. 
<BR>
Your goal is to &quot;RECEIVE AT LEAST 100+ ORDERS FOR REPORT #2 
<BR>
WITHIN 2 WEEKS. IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO. ONCE 
<BR>
YOU HAVE 100 ORDERS, THE REST IS EASY, RELAX, YOU WILL MAKE YOUR 
<BR>
$50,000 GOAL.&quot;
<BR>
Well, I had 196 orders for REPORT #2, 96 more than I needed. So I 
<BR>
sat back
<BR>
And relaxed. By March 1, of my e-mailing of 10,000, I received 
<BR>
$58,000 with more coming in every day. 
<BR>
I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car. Please 
<BR>
take time to read the attached program, 
<BR>
IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER!!! Remember that it won't work 
<BR>
if you don't try it. This program does work, but you must follow 
<BR>
it EXACTLY! Especially the rules of not trying to place your name 
<BR>
in a different place. It won't work, you'll lose out on a lot of 
<BR>
money! In order for this program to work, you must meet your goal 
<BR>
of 20+ orders for REPORT#1, and100+ orders for REPORT #2 and you 
<BR>
will make $50,000 or more in 90 days. 
<BR>
I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS!!!
<BR>
<P>If you choose not to participate in this program, I am sorry. It 
<BR>
really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you. If 
<BR>
you choose to participate, follow the program and you will be on 
<BR>
your way to financial security.
<BR>
<P>If you are a fellow business owner and are if financial trouble 
<BR>
like I was, or you want to start your own business, consider this 
<BR>
a sign. I DID!
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
Johnathon Rourke
<BR>
<P>P.S. Do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,000) look 
<BR>
like piled upon a kitchen table? IT'S AWESOME!
<BR>
<P>------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:
<BR>
<P>By the time you have read the enclosed program and reports, you 
<BR>
should have concluded that an amateur could, not have created 
<BR>
such a program, and one that is legal.
<BR>
<P>Let me tell you a little about myself. I had a profitable 
<BR>
business for 10 years. Then in 1979 my business began falling 
<BR>
off. I was doing the same things that were previously successful 
<BR>
for me, but it wasn't working. Finally, I figured it out. It 
<BR>
wasn't me, it was the economy. Inflation and recession had 
<BR>
replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945. I 
<BR>
don't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate... 
<BR>
because many of you know from first hand experience. There were 
<BR>
more failures and bankruptcies than ever before. The middle class 
<BR>
was vanishing. Those who knew what they were doing invested 
<BR>
wisely and moved up. Those who did not, including those who never 
<BR>
had anything to save or invest, were moving down into the ranks 
<BR>
of the poor. As the saying goes, &quot;THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE 
<BR>
POOR GET POORER.&quot; The traditional methods of making money will 
<BR>
never allow you to &quot;move up&quot; or &quot;get rich&quot;, inflation will see to 
<BR>
that.
<BR>
<P>You have just received information that can give you financial 
<BR>
freedom for the rest of your life, with
<BR>
&quot;NO RISK&quot; and &quot;JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT.&quot; You can make more 
<BR>
money in the next few months than you have ever imagined. I 
<BR>
should also point out that I will not see a penny of this money, 
<BR>
nor anyone else who has provided a
<BR>
Testimonial for this program. I have already made over 4 MILLION 
<BR>
DOLLARS! I have retired from the program after sending out over 
<BR>
16,000 programs. Now I have several offices that make this and 
<BR>
several other programs here and over seas.
<BR>
Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any 
<BR>
way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a 
<BR>
copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of. One of 
<BR>
the people you send this to may send out 50,000...and your name 
<BR>
will be on everyone of them!
<BR>
Remember though, the more you send out the more potential 
<BR>
customers you will reach.
<BR>
<P>So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials 
<BR>
and opportunity to become financially independent, 
<BR>
IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!
<BR>
<P>&quot;THINK ABOUT IT&quot;
<BR>
Before you delete this program from your mailbox, as I almost 
<BR>
did, take a little time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT. Get 
<BR>
a pencil and figure out what could happen when YOU participate. 
<BR>
Figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you 
<BR>
calculate it, you will still make a lot of money! You will 
<BR>
definitely get back what you invested. Any doubts you have will 
<BR>
vanish when your first orders come in. IT WORKS!
<BR>

<BR>
HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU THOUSANDS OF 
<BR>
DOLLAR$
<BR>
------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
INSTRUCTIONS:
<BR>
<P>Before you say &quot;BULL... &quot;, Please read this program carefully. 
<BR>
This is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making 
<BR>
opportunity. Basically, this is what you do: As with all 
<BR>
multi-level businesses, we build our business by recruiting new 
<BR>
partners and selling our products. Every state in the USA allows 
<BR>
you to recruit new multi-level business partners, and we offer a 
<BR>
product for EVERY dollar sent.
<BR>
YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not 
<BR>
involved in personal selling. You do it privately in your own 
<BR>
home, store or office. This is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail 
<BR>
Order Marketing anywhere:
<BR>
<P><P>This is what you MUST do:
<BR>
1. Order all 4 reports shown on the list below (you can't sell 
<BR>
them if
<BR>
You don't order them).
<BR>
<P>* For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME &amp; NUMBEROF THE 
<BR>
REPORT YOU ARE
<BR>
ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME &amp; RETURN ADDRESS (in 
<BR>
case of a
<BR>
problem) to the person whose name appears on the list next to the 
<BR>
report.
<BR>
<P>MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE IN CASE OF ANY 
<BR>
MAIL PROBLEMS!
<BR>
* When you place your order, make sure you order each of the four 
<BR>
reports. You will need all four reports so that you can save them 
<BR>
on your computer and resell them.
<BR>
<P>* Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 
<BR>
four reports. Save them on your computer so they will be 
<BR>
accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will 
<BR>
order them from you.
<BR>
<P>2. IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are 
<BR>
listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any 
<BR>
way other than is instructed below in steps &quot;a&quot; through &quot;f&quot; or 
<BR>
you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once you 
<BR>
understand the way this works, you'll also see how it doesn't 
<BR>
work if you change it. Remember that this method has been tested, 
<BR>
and if you alter it, it will not work.
<BR>
<P>a. Look below for the listing of available reports.
<BR>
<P>b. After you've ordered the four reports, take this advertisement 
<BR>
and remove the name and address under REPORT #4. This person has 
<BR>
made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $50,000!
<BR>
<P>c. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4.
<BR>
<P>d. Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3.
<BR>
<P>e. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2.
<BR>
<P>f. Insert your name/address in the REPORT #1 position.
<BR>
<P>Please make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY!
<BR>
<P>3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, 
<BR>
and save it to your computer. Make NO changes to the instruction 
<BR>
portion of this letter.
<BR>
<P>Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely 
<BR>
you can afford $20). You obviously already have an Internet 
<BR>
connection and e-mail is FREE!
<BR>
<P>To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 4 
<BR>
reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing 
<BR>
information which includes how to send bulk e-mails, where to 
<BR>
find thousands of free classified ads and much, much more.
<BR>
<P>In addition you will be provided with information on Internet 
<BR>
Marketing 
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://homepage1-2.virtualave.net/index3.htm">http://homepage1-2.virtualave.net/index3.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>There are two primary methods of building your downline:
<BR>
METHOD #1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL
<BR>
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it 
<BR>
goes, and we'll assume you and all those involved send out only 
<BR>
2,000 programs each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives 
<BR>
a 0.5% response.  Using a good list the response could be much 
<BR>
better. Also, many people will send out hundreds of thousands of 
<BR>
programs instead of 2,000. But continuing with this example, you 
<BR>
send out only 2,000 programs. With a 0.5% response, that is only 
<BR>
10 orders for REPORT #1. Those 10 people respond by sending out 
<BR>
2,000 programs each for a total of 20,000. Out of those 0.5%, 100 
<BR>
people respond and order REPORT #2. Those 100 mails out 2,000 
<BR>
programs each for a total of 200,000. The 0.5% response to that 
<BR>
is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3. Those 1,000 send out 2,000 
<BR>
programs each for a 2,000,000 total. The 0.5% response to that is 
<BR>
10,000 orders for REPORT #4. That's 10,000 $5 bills for you. 
<BR>
CASH!!! Your total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5,000 
<BR>
+
<BR>
$50,000 for a total of  $55,550!!!
<BR>
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE 
<BR>
YOU MAIL TO
<BR>
WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM! DARE TO THINK 
<BR>
FOR A
<BR>
MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 
<BR>
PROGRAMS
<BR>
INSTEAD OF 2,000. Believe me, many people will do just that, and 
<BR>
more! By the way, your cost to participate in this is practically 
<BR>
nothing. You obviously already have an Internet connection and 
<BR>
e-mail is FREE!!!
<BR>
<P>REPORT #2 will show you the best methods for bulk e mailing, tell 
<BR>
you where to obtain free bulk e-mail software and where to obtain 
<BR>
e-mail lists.
<BR>
METHOD #2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
<BR>
<P>1. Advertising on the 'Net is very, very inexpensive, and there 
<BR>
are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide to 
<BR>
start small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to 
<BR>
get ONLY 10 people to participate on your first level. (Placing a 
<BR>
lot of FREE ads on the Internet will EASILY get a larger 
<BR>
response.) Also assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION 
<BR>
gets ONLY 10 downline members.
<BR>
<P>Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below.
<BR>
<P>1st level--your 10 members with $5 .........................$50
<BR>
2nd level--10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100)..............$500
<BR>
3rd level--10 members from those 100 ($5 x 
<BR>
1,000)...........$5,000
<BR>
4th level--10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 
<BR>
10,000)........$50,000
<BR>
----------- THIS TOTALS 
<BR>
------------------------------------$55,550
<BR>
<P>Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate 
<BR>
only recruit 10 people each. Think for a moment what would happen 
<BR>
if they got 20 people to participate! Most people get 100's of 
<BR>
participants! THINK ABOUT IT!
<BR>
<P>For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the 
<BR>
report they ordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE 
<BR>
ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out, 
<BR>
with YOUR name and address on it, will be prompt because they 
<BR>
can't advertise until they receive the report!
<BR>
<P>------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
AVAILABLE REPORTS

<BR>
<P>*** Order Each REPORT by NUMBER and NAME ***
<BR>
Notes:

<P><P>******* TIPS FOR SUCCESS *******
<BR>
<P>* TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS! Be prompt, professional, and 
<BR>
follow the directions accurately.
<BR>
<P>* Send for the four reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them 
<BR>
when the orders start coming in because:
<BR>
When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested 
<BR>
product/report.
<BR>
<P>* ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.
<BR>
<P>* Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the 
<BR>
instructions exactly, your results
<BR>
WILL BE SUCCESSFUL!
<BR>
<P>* ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!
<BR>
<P>******* YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES *******
<BR>
Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:
<BR>
<P>If you don't receive 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, 
<BR>
continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. Then, a 
<BR>
couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for 
<BR>
REPORT#2. If you don't, continue advertising or sending e-mails 
<BR>
until you do.
<BR>
<P>Once you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN 
<BR>
RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the 
<BR>
cash will continue to roll in!
<BR>
<P>THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:
<BR>
<P>Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in 
<BR>
front of a DIFFERENT report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS 
<BR>
by watching which report people are ordering from you. If you 
<BR>
want to generate more income, send another batch of e-mails or 
<BR>
continue placing ads and start the whole process again!
<BR>
<P>There is no limit to the income you will generate from this 
<BR>
business!
<BR>

<BR>
<P><P>******* T E S T I M O N I A L S *******
<BR>
<P>This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! 
<BR>
Especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a 
<BR>
different position, it won't work and you'll lose a lot of 
<BR>
potential income. I'm living proof that it works. It really is a 
<BR>
great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost 
<BR>
to you. If you do choose to participate, follow the program 
<BR>
exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security. Steven 
<BR>

<BR>
<P>My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody, and I live in Chicago, IL. I 
<BR>
am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make 
<BR>
pretty good money. When I received the program I grumbled to Jody 
<BR>
about receiving &quot;junk mail.&quot; I made fun of the whole thing, 
<BR>
spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. 
<BR>
I &quot;knew&quot; it wouldn't work. Jody totally
<BR>
Ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I 
<BR>
made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old &quot;I told 
<BR>
you so&quot; on her when the thing didn't work... well, the laugh was 
<BR>
on me! Within two weeks she had received over 50 responses. 
<BR>
Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was 
<BR>
shocked! I was sure that I had it all figured and that it 
<BR>
wouldn't work. I AM a believer now. I have joined Jody in her 
<BR>
&quot;hobby.&quot; I did have seven more years until retirement, but I 
<BR>
think of the &quot;rat race&quot; and it's not for me. We owe it all to 
<BR>
MLM. Mitchell Wolf MD., Chicago, IL
<BR>
<P>The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this 
<BR>
system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to 
<BR>
get a large amount of money in a short time. I was approached 
<BR>
several times before I checked this out. I joined just to see 
<BR>
what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money 
<BR>
required. To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the first 
<BR>
14 weeks, with money still coming in. Sincerely yours, Charles 
<BR>
Morris, Esq.
<BR>
<P>Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up 
<BR>
my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, 
<BR>
I decided that the initial investment was so little that there 
<BR>
was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get 
<BR>
my money back. Boy, was I surprised when I found my medium-size 
<BR>
post office box crammed with orders! For awhile, it got so 
<BR>
overloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window. 
<BR>
I'll make more money this
<BR>
Year than any 10 years of my life before. The nice thing about 
<BR>
this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live. There 
<BR>
simply isn't a better investment with a faster return

<P><P>I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I 
<BR>
wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no 
<BR>
idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I 
<BR>
was e-mailed another program, ...11 months passed then it 
<BR>
came...I didn't delete this one!...I made more than $41,000 on 
<BR>
the first try!!                     Violet Wilson, Johnstown, PA
<BR>
<P>This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit 
<BR>
our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the 
<BR>
interest on our money. The only way on earth that this plan will 
<BR>
work for you is if you do it. For your sake and for your family's 
<BR>
sake don't pass up this golden opportunity.
<BR>
Good luck and happy spending!                 Kerry Ford,
