<EM>&gt;  I don't think Linux will run on TURBOchannel Alphas at the moment.  There

<P>Correct - Linux won't run on the DEC 3000 yet.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wasn't updated for quite some time, though, so I am not sure what the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; current status is.
</EM><BR>
<P>Nod - *sigh*.  I guess I should at least update that page!  Since Nov
<BR>
'99, I have done zero work on the DEC 3000...  It's not that I want to
<BR>
drop the project, but I've been pushed to the limit trying to write
<BR>
thesis/defend/graduate...  On a more positive note, I have been
<BR>
stockpiling various TC option cards and have picked up a few more DEC
<BR>
3000 models to work with (and a couple DECstations to check stuff
<BR>
with).  I would very much like to (and plan on) get back to it, unless
<BR>
someone else does it first.  Probably not before July, however.
<BR>
<P>I don't have my notes in front of me, but I got through to entIF
<BR>
(IIRC) before crapping out.  I'm a bit foggy on the details now.
<BR>
<P>If you are looking for something to run on DEC 3000 boxen now, you
<BR>
probably want to check into one of the *BSDs or the Hobbyist Tru64.
<BR>
