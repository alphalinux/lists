Hello Risko,
<BR>
<P>I believe the design is based on the Microsoft Sound Card. I do not
<BR>
have a machine of that design (or with sound running), but maybe this can
<BR>
help you.  Try to look at sound setup for Microsoft sound system.
<BR>
<P>In order to have sound on that system under Tru64 (Digital) UNIX, you would
<BR>
need to do an ISACFG call to enable it at SRM.  If the ISA config code
<BR>
does not have it enabled, you will not get sound.  
<BR>
<P>So,
<BR>
<P>At SRM, execute &quot;isacfg -all&quot; and look for the sound entry.  It will
<BR>
be after the keyboard and comm ports. On my AlphaStation 255 (newer model),
<BR>
the sound entry is called &quot;PCXBJ&quot;.
<BR>
<P>iobase0 = 530, iobase1 = 388 irq0 = 9 dma0 = 0 dma1 = 1
<BR>
<P>All entries that start with &quot;800xxxxx&quot; mean they are not used.
<BR>
<P>Also realize that slot information is not physical, but logical to the
<BR>
ISA/PCI subsystem.
<BR>

<P><P>Hi!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It's an isa card, isn't it?
</EM><BR>
It is a special bus, shorter than a pci. But I think it's ISA compatible,
<BR>
because the srm bios summarize this card in ISA slots. If I compile the
<BR>
cs4232 support to the kernel, and persistent dma, with io 0x530, irq 9,
<BR>
dma 0, dma2 -1, than the card didn't recognized by kernel at startup. 
<BR>
If i compile it to module, and I try modprobe the IRQ/DRQ doesn't work.
<BR>
(kernel log).
<BR>
<P>Can everybody send me a complete .config from a as200, with sound?
<BR>
