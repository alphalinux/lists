<P>
A while back I sent out an email requesting good benchmarks for SMP
<BR>
Alpha machines.  The only seemingly viable response I received was one
<BR>
recommending the SPLASH benchmark, with a request to post my results.  I
<BR>
obtained and attempted to use the SPLASH2 set of programs which are
<BR>
available from www-flash.stanford.edu.
<BR>
<P>Here is what I found:
<BR>
<P>1) The benchmark programs do not compile as downloaded.  There is some
<BR>
problem with missing identifiers and external functions.  This was done
<BR>
with the null macros supplied with the benchmark suite on a UP Alpha
<BR>
(our development platform).  The null macros are supposed to nullify the
<BR>
SMP nature of the tests and allow them to be compiled for a UP test. 
<BR>
This failed.
<BR>
<P>2) The only available references in the supplied material are obsolete
<BR>
email addresses for people/groups that I would have to guess are no
<BR>
longer available at Stanford.
<BR>
<P>3) The only available sets of macros that are &quot;done&quot; are for three
<BR>
machines, none of which matches Linux or Alpha.  The closest set, that
<BR>
for SGI's IRIX, include a precompiled library with no apparent source
<BR>
and no references on how to construct an equivalent for other machines.
<BR>
<P>I suppose that I could spend a lot of time and effort tracking these
<BR>
specific problems down and resolving them, and I have no doubt that I
<BR>
could.  However, my charter at the moment does not allow for this kind
<BR>
of time and effort, and is unlikely to for the foreseeable future.
<BR>
<P>Any other suggestions for benchmarks that are viable, either for Linux
<BR>
or Alpha or both, would be most welcome.  Of course I will publish
<BR>
whatever I find that is of interest.
<BR>
<P>For the record, the Harvard benchmark that I was using (hbench) coupled
<BR>
with a modified version of Stephen Tweedie's sard program that I wrote
<BR>
to generate interrupt statistics revealed one fact (confirmed) of which
<BR>
I had been previously unaware: multi-CPU Alpha systems do not distribute
<BR>
interrupts across the processors.  CPU 0 handles all of them.  My
<BR>
Compaq/Digital contact tells me that there was no demand for this, so it
<BR>
wasn't done.
<BR>
<P>Regards.
