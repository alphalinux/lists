<P>
<EM>&gt; This reply is STRICTLY opinion on my part (please, no processor wars).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In my opinion, if your application has a lot of parallelism (as I suspect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given you are proposing a 100 node machine) then you are better off using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Intel processors, strictly because they have the most market support, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thus are cheaper, easier to get, have more software available, and will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; easier to upgrade in the future (unless Intel decides to keep changing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; package every year &lt;sigh&gt;).
</EM><BR>
<P>On the other hand, Alphas are much faster on FP, so he may find that
<BR>
he gets much more bang for his buck with Alphas. &quot;most market support&quot;
<BR>
doesn't mean you should check to see if Alphas are cheapest for his
<BR>
application. Alphas are also easy to get, have plenty of free
<BR>
software, and I'm not sure what upgradability means these days. Alpha
<BR>
motherboards are the same size as everyone else's and they take
<BR>
commodity memory. Intel is always changing their packaging, so I'd say
<BR>
an Alpha's upgradability is about the same.
<BR>
<P>In short, worth a look.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you are already planning to use Myrinet, then the communication bandwidth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't really an issue related to the CPUs.
</EM><BR>
<P>Wrong. Some applications have higher bandwidth needs than others, so
<BR>
this generalizatin is a bad one.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Thus I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggesting that 200 P2's are probably a better bet than 100 Alphas at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same cost (just an example, I'm not suggesting this is the actual cost ratio).
</EM><BR>
<P>I think that if you do the math, you will find that this isn't the
<BR>
case.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Being a &quot;dyed-in-the-wool&quot; Beowulf person, I tend to believe that the best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; approach is to use a larger number of the most cost effective devices you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can get.  Cost effective including all aspects of hardware and software, not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just CPU price and speed.  For better or for worse, this is currently Intel.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with you until the last sentence. If you look at the cluster
<BR>
market, you'll find a lot of Alpha clusters.
