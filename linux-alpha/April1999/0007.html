<P>
<EM>&gt; Our problem is now that there are very few 21264 around, that it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unclear what kind of boards will there be in the near future and how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they will perform, and how much they will cost in the end.
</EM><BR>
<P>The XP1000 is Compaq's single-processor workstation. It is out now and
<BR>
should have identical performance (and clock speeds) to the
<BR>
single-processor OEM board (264SP), which should be out &quot;real soon
<BR>
now&quot;.
<BR>
<P>I can buy &quot;bare&quot; XP1000s for $4,300. I don't think pricing has been
<BR>
announced yet for the 264SP.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As the deadline for our project nears, I would appreciate any hints,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tips, or comments. We would very much like to hear from people that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use (or are going to) the 21264 for scientific computing cluster
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; applications, especially with a high-speed interconnect like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Myrinet.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are several such clusters out there: CPLANT, mine, RWCP...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Or maybe somebody knew whom to contact at Compaq/DEC about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this?
</EM><BR>
<P>I have contacts with the Digital Workstation group, if you like.
<BR>
However, they are in the US.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One point is here that we will need MPI directly over the netword
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; card, without the TCP/IP stack. As far as we have learned, there is an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implementation from RWCP/SCore, and a commercial one from ParaStation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in Karlsruhe (Germany), and more maybe to come with VIA, or maybe not.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would recommend trying the Myricom-supported GM driver and mpich/GM
<BR>
software. There are similar mpich implementations from RWCP (mpich/PM)
<BR>
and the BIP people in France. Myricom has a VIA interface on top of
<BR>
GM, but there's no reason to use it if you're going to be using MPI
<BR>
anyway.
