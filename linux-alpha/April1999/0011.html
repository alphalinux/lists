Hi Y'll
<BR>
<P>Well, the good news is that Linux booted, and Debian installed.
<BR>
All that it took was getting the SRM How-TO from alphalinux.org, and a
<BR>
floppy image.
<BR>
<P>For those more confused than I am, here is my understanding of this
<BR>
whole process:
<BR>
<P>*  Following Alpha and SRM HowTo's one makes a boot floppy.
<BR>
*  This floppy contains at the first block or so aboot which is a short
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;second-stage boot for Linux.  then it contains an ext2 filesystem in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which one puts their favorite kernel.
<BR>
*  For installation purposes, this kernel needs to be configured with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RAM disk, and something called initrd.
<BR>
*  The RAMDisk allows the kernel, at boot time to create a ``block
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;device'' which is really a block of memory.
<BR>
*  The initrd option allows the ramdisk to load a given filesystem
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;image into that ramdisk.
<BR>
<P><P>*  You get the machine powered up.
<BR>
*  At the SRM prompt, you put the boot/kernel floppy in the drive and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type boot dva0.  Contrary to popular belief, this does work on DS20.
<BR>
*  You will get an aboot&gt; prompt
<BR>
*  Type ``vmlinux.gz root=/dev/fd0 load_ramdisk=1 prompt_ramdisk=1''
<BR>
*  When you see a prompt to insert the filesystem/root disk, do so.  I
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used the Debian 2.1 (slink) disk.
<BR>
*  The rest will be a normal install.
<BR>
*  When partitioning, do NOT use cfdisk (the default);  it creates PC
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fdisk partitions and belive or not, not the entire world use these.
<BR>
*  Instead, escape into a shell, type fdisk, then the ``b'' option, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;create BSD disklabel partitions.
<BR>
*  Remember disklabel partitions can overlap!  As a matter of fact,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;partition ``c'' is assumed to be the whole disk.  Partition ``b'' is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the swap device.  Old Unices created /root in `a' and then used `g',
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`h'.
<BR>
*  I did this (IMPORTANT):  Created partition `h' first.  IT is small
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(few megabytes, say 16) and starts at sector zero.  Then I put swap
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in `b', root in `a', usr in `d', var in `f', and home on `g'.  this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is everely suboptimal for a large server, but allowed me to install.
<BR>
<P>PROBLEMS:
<BR>
<P>*  fdisk (option b) is broken;  IT uses 32 bit integer for computing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sizes, and gets very confused. Perhaps the confusion is only in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf to the stdout, but the result is that what you type and what
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you get are not the same.
<BR>
*  fdisk is further broken by ``correcting and improving'' your input. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you say cylinder 55 to start a partition, it will round it off to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cylinder 54, or even 53.  This created apparent overlaps.
<BR>
*  Overlap between partitions is not good.  It means that when /usr
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fills up, it will wipe out the super-block for /home, etc.
<BR>
*  The system booted, convinced it is April 15th, 1931.  this confuses
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debian installation tools.  In particular these that use make.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running hwclock would have helped, but it fails on this platform.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;*  I have yet to figure out how to install aboot &amp; Co. on the hard
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disk.  So there will be another note coming.
<BR>
<P>I have done no Linux work in several years, so perhaps this note does
<BR>
not belong here, or belongs elsewhere too.  Feel free to redirect.
