Hi everybody,
<BR>
<P>our group is currently considering setting up an O(100) processors
<BR>
compute cluster instead of buying a commercial compute server. It
<BR>
seems to us that single-processor boards with the new Alpha 21264
<BR>
interconnected by Myrinet will be the choice of the day for our
<BR>
problem class (lattice gauge theories, needing lots of communication
<BR>
bandwidth). Yes, we might get this kind of money, but the resulting
<BR>
system has to beat industry-standard systems in performance.
<BR>
<P>Our problem is now that there are very few 21264 around, that it is
<BR>
unclear what kind of boards will there be in the near future and how
<BR>
they will perform, and how much they will cost in the end. There seems
<BR>
to be a lot of experience with SMP Pentiums and Myrinet, but we think
<BR>
that the new Alpha could outperform them on our application. The
<BR>
operating system will probably be GNU/Linux.
<BR>
<P>As the deadline for our project nears, I would appreciate any hints,
<BR>
tips, or comments. We would very much like to hear from people that
<BR>
use (or are going to) the 21264 for scientific computing cluster
<BR>
applications, especially with a high-speed interconnect like
<BR>
Myrinet. Or maybe somebody knew whom to contact at Compaq/DEC about
<BR>
this?
<BR>
<P>One point is here that we will need MPI directly over the netword
<BR>
card, without the TCP/IP stack. As far as we have learned, there is an 
<BR>
implementation from RWCP/SCore, and a commercial one from ParaStation
<BR>
in Karlsruhe (Germany), and more maybe to come with VIA, or maybe not.
<BR>
<P>Thank you very much!
<BR>
<P>-Christoph
