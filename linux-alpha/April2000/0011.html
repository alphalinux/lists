<P>
I've modified time.c like this
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/* If the given value is within 1% of what we calculated,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accept it.  Otherwise, use what we found.  */
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cycle_freq = hwrpb-&gt;cycle_freq;
<BR>
&lt;       one_percent = cycle_freq / 100;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;       one_percent = cycle_freq / 10000;
</EM><BR>
<P>Almost always ignore hwrpb-&gt;cycle_freq
<BR>
and works much better. Allowing 1% means 864sec error/day.
<BR>
I think comparing hwrpb-&gt;cycle_freq and calculated one is
<BR>
meaningless, It's like saying &quot;measured value can be wrong&quot;.
<BR>
And it means using rpcc can also be wrong.
<BR>
<P>Anyway differences btw. hwrpb and estimated were
<BR>
599769920 - 598802395 =  967525 0.16%
<BR>
699300699 - 698843222 =  457477 0.06%
<BR>
751879699 - 749712100 = 2167599 0.2%
<BR>
<P>I thought alpha has different archtecture.
<BR>
A company hw designer said nautilus has 100MHz base clock and
<BR>
CPU clock is multiple of that. And, unfortunately,
<BR>
I have DP264 with 500MHz CPU and it's cpuinfo looks
<BR>
<P>cycle frequency [Hz]    : 500000000 
<BR>
platform string         : AlphaPC 264DP 500 MHz
<BR>
<P>The system is being up for more than a month and clock is accurate.
<BR>
Perfect~!
<BR>
So I guessed It's different from PC, they are not multiple of
<BR>
33.333333, CPU clock is well rounded so 699300699 is a wrong one.
<BR>
<P>Anyway we still have chance to get 8.6sec error/day, 
<BR>
and there's measurement error usually 2000 counts btw min and max.
<BR>
So why don't we synch with cmos clock once a day or so? 
<BR>
If we can't trust cmos then measuring cycle frequency
<BR>
based on cmos is meaningless. Let LX alone.
<BR>

<P>So you're asserting that your CPU's crystal runs at *exactly* 700MHz?
<BR>
You assert that there is no variance in the manufacturing process?
<BR>
<P>Have you hooked that crystal up to an osciliscope (or other analysis
<BR>
tool) to see that the actual frequency of that crystal is closer to
<BR>
700MHz than to 699.3MHz?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think we cannot measure the frequency accurately always. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps not, but there's very little else we can do I'm afraid.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So what about rounding off the frequency count?
</EM><BR>
<P>That would almost certainly do more harm than good.
