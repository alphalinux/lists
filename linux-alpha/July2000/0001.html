Hi,
<BR>
<P>I have a PW-433 that I'm using as a linux server. The problem is that when
<BR>
it crashes (a bit too often, it's very unreliable at load), it often won't
<BR>
come back up again.
<BR>
<P>Now from what I've read in the kernel list, 2.2.17 should solve my
<BR>
reliablility problems, but the fact is, when you switch the machine off it
<BR>
usually won't come back on until you power cycle it around 10 times.
<BR>
<P>It has a keyboard connected to it at all times, but only a monitor when
<BR>
there's something wrong (it's colocated). I'm wondering if the video card in
<BR>
it is causing APM to spew upon boot - I noticed problems with it when
<BR>
attached to my Iiyama monitor, but it ran fine on a 14&quot; non power-saving
<BR>
monitor.
<BR>
<P>Has anyone else experienced similar problems?
<BR>
<P>Many thanks,
<BR>
<P>John
