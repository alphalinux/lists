<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From: loic@myri.com
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what would be the right person to contact to try to make things
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more consistent? Is there currently a standard way to map PCI
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;memory space both in the kernel and in user-space aside from using
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some #ifdefs?
<BR>
<P>The problem is that virt_to_phys and virt_to_bus mean two totally
<BR>
different things on architectures like sparc64 where PCI memory space
<BR>
is disjoint from the physical RAM space.
<BR>
<P>In some cases you want the &quot;physical&quot; address as seen by the CPU, in
<BR>
other cases you want the &quot;physical&quot; address as seen by a bus mastering
<BR>
PCI device.  For PCI memory space these two values are different in
<BR>
both cases on some machines, and there is no public mechanism to deal
<BR>
with this.
<BR>
<P>Take the ncr53c8xx.c SCSI driver for example, it must deal with all of
<BR>
these issues because of how the scsi processor needs to touch it's own
<BR>
registers via PCI memory space transactions addressed to itself and
<BR>
the assosciated bus_dvma_to_mem() macros it defines per architecture.
<BR>
<P>I'll be frank and say there is nobody you can talk to in order to get
<BR>
this cleaned up for 2.2.x Linux, that simply isn't going to happen.
<BR>
Maybe for 2.3.x...
<BR>
<P>Another issue is that all of the ISA/EISA drivers want to say:
<BR>
outb(0x370) or whatever and expect it to access standard ISA ports on
<BR>
all architectures, yet outb(pci_dev-&gt;base_address[0]) should work
<BR>
correctly too.  See where the problems are?
<BR>
<P>Just use ifdefs for now, it will get cleaned up eventually, the &quot;inner
<BR>
circle&quot; of Linux developers know it is a problem but we're putting out
<BR>
much larger fires at the moment.
<BR>
<P>Later,
<BR>
