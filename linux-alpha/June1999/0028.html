Hello,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm on a ruffian system and have a sound card which is quite nice
<BR>
except that it only does 30 bits of address, and thus can only access
<BR>
memory under the 1Gig mark, which is exactly where the DMA window starts.
<BR>
Would it be possible for me to lower the starting address of the DMA
<BR>
window and thus where all virt_to_bus addresses start?  This would be a
<BR>
major help to me as the card is quite nice in all other regards.  I tried
<BR>
the simple way of adjusting linux/include/asm-alpha/core_pyxis.h to:
<BR>
#define PYXIS_DMA_WIN_BASE_DEFAULT      (1024*1024*512)
<BR>
but the kernel couldn't mount  the root filesystem when I tried that
<BR>
kernel (to be honest I'm not surprised).  Is this possible?  Is there any
<BR>
way to do what I'm trying to do?  Any help would be very greatly
<BR>
appreciated.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Chris
