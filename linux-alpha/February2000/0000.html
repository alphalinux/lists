Hi,  I installed a new 164SX with a 533MHz cpu into a generic atx case,
<BR>
along with 2 new 32M DIMMS (advantage memory DIMMS for the 164SX), a
<BR>
diamond stealth 64 pci video card, floppy drive,and an ide hard drive
<BR>
and cdrom. I had put the soft power switch to J1 on the board, and it
<BR>
powers up fine, the cpu fan and case fan spins, I get a cycle from the
<BR>
keyboard, and the drives all kick on, but thats it. I dont get any
<BR>
video, nor do I get any beep codes. Its as if something is not signaling
<BR>
the CPU voltage to kick on. I do belive I have the drives properly
<BR>
hooked up (red stripe to 1) and the configuration switchpack is set
<BR>
correctly, but I am starting to wonder if I need to hook up anything
<BR>
more than just the speaker and reset button to the pin array (J20). I
<BR>
see in the book there are connections for the Halt_button, HD_PU, Vdd,
<BR>
but have no idea what these are for, so I did not use them. I am
<BR>
starting to wonder if I need something connected to these to get it to
<BR>
boot properly. Perhaps it is memory related, but they are new DIMMS and
<BR>
I insured that I was static free when I installed everything, so now I
<BR>
am at a loss. I have tried to move the DIMMs and video card around to no
<BR>
avail, and also turned the ide cables around. Still no luck. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really hate to bother you guys on this list about this
<BR>
problem, but I
<BR>
am really puzzled and have ran out of ideas. 
<BR>
<P>Thanks in advance for any and all advice you can give, I wish you all
<BR>
the best of luck in the new year.
