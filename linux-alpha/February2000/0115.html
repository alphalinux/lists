<P>_All_ drivers that does some kind of PCI-DMA are been broken by 2.3.43
<BR>
(not only the network and scsi drivers).

<P>There are not a few SCSI drivers and some network card in the kernel.

<P>Not all drivers are doing PCI-DMA of course, but a good percentage yes and
<BR>
brekaing the whole thing is something should be done at the _start_ and
<BR>
not at the _end_ of an unstable branch IMVHO (btw, I am assuming we are at
<BR>
the end). Here I don't have the 9 alpha platforms each with more than
<BR>
2giga of ram and all the device driver tha does PCI-DMA to try out if they
<BR>
works or not. And that's not my own problem but I think it's a problem of
<BR>
most maintainers of the drivers. To be sure all is working correctly it's
<BR>
necessary to give the time to the people who has all this flavours of
<BR>
hardware to test the thing and feed us bugreports.
<BR>
<P>And I am not either sure if all alpha plaforms are capable of a PCIMMU and
<BR>
if they can support more than 2/4giga of ram at the same time, Richard
<BR>
what's going on (in 2.3.43) for:
<BR>
<P>o	irongate
<BR>
o	polaris
<BR>
o	t2
<BR>
<P>In 2.3.43 they have _no_ way to work _even_ supposing all drivers out
<BR>
there would be just using the pci_map/umap if there's more then 2/4 giga
<BR>
of RAM in the system. Is the hardware memory limited to 2/4 giga for such
<BR>
platforms?
<BR>
<P>And what you break is not something that won't compile. Is not either
<BR>
something that won't work. All will work fine and compile until the
<BR>
unlucky user will try to run a special driver on a certain flavour of
<BR>
alpha with &gt;2g of RAM installed in the system.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;not do is work on forward-porting the band-aid 2TB support hacks you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;did for 2.2.x (which for 2.2.x was the correct way to do it) and
</EM><BR>
<P>If I won't do anything what is going to happen is that 2.4.0 will produce
<BR>
random bug reports on alpha only with a bigmemory setup and that's very
<BR>
bad IMHO. Such big machines should be the ones running most reliable. Give
<BR>
me a good reason for not doing that or tell me a shostopper that my way
<BR>
has please.
<BR>
<P>Since you say you just fixed your commonly used drivers you also know the
<BR>
only downside you would have from running my work is that the dcache and
<BR>
the icache and the other kernel-proper stuff will stay locked in the first
<BR>
2giga of RAM (at least if I am not going to add a __GFP_XX in the
<BR>
allocations). But that doesn't seems a problem at all to me. Is it a
<BR>
problem for you? I think nobody needs more than 2giga of RAM outside
<BR>
userspace/shm memory and outside the page cache in the next few years.
<BR>
<P>And no, in my way I won't do I/O bounces with the updated scsi drivers and
<BR>
I'll use the whole memory for allocating skb on updated nic drivers
<BR>
(hoping the hardware and your recent work in arch/alpha/kernel/core_* is
<BR>
not buggy).
<BR>
<P>When 2.5.0 will be out removing all the |__GFP_XX will be done with a
<BR>
script simpler than the one that cleanedup the fops initializers and the
<BR>
__GFP_XX will be defined as a zero. And once the script will return I'll
<BR>
break things exactly as you did in 2.3.43 (but at that time most drivers
<BR>
will been updated and breaking in 2.5.0 is not a problem at all) and
<BR>
during 2.4.* I always run rock solid and as fast and as powerful as
<BR>
the official 2.4.*.
<BR>
<P>I'd appreciate if you reply telling me where I am wrong. Thanks.
