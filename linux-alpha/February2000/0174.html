<P>It would be great, if I could be notified when this is going to happen (or
<BR>
at least the architecture maintainers, Jes will surely forward it).
<BR>
I see some possible problems if you going to unify it too much and define
<BR>
some requirements, that might need some workarounds.
<BR>
<P>First, isn't the irq probing stuff ISA related? I don't know of any other
<BR>
insanity that would need this.
<BR>
<P>My second and main problem there is do_IRQ(). Is that really supposed to
<BR>
be architecture dependend? On a halfway sane interrupt architecure I
<BR>
optimize you this, so that there is almost nothing left, that couldn't be
<BR>
done in the assembler entry immediatly. Unfortunately my knowledge about
<BR>
the ia32 interrupt stuff isn't as good as I'd like to, anyway, I hope that 
<BR>
most of the following ideas don't seem to come from a different world. :)
<BR>
<P>- I think the spinlock in there isn't really necessary, if real state
<BR>
changes are only happen from non-interrupt contexts. Everywhere else would
<BR>
be a &quot;disable_irq(); spin_lock()&quot; sequence sufficient.
<BR>
- I doubt that all the status stuff is really necessary, except for
<BR>
IRQ_INPROGRESS for SMP synchronisation.
<BR>
- IRQ_REPLAY: Do interrupt handler require a real interrupt context or
<BR>
isn't a faked context sufficient?
<BR>
- IRQ_WAITING: it's only used for int probing and could IMO be moved to a
<BR>
special interrupt handler.
<BR>
- IRQ_DISABLED: We could implement an optimistic scheme, where we replace
<BR>
the action field with a dummy action, that keeps the interrupt disabled.
<BR>
enable_irq()/disable_irq() would be very cheap then and we disable the
<BR>
interrupt only when the really interrupt happens (and most of the time not
<BR>
at all for short disable_irq()/enable_irq() sequences).
<BR>
- IRQ_PENDING: If I interpret the comment there correctly, the check is
<BR>
only necessary for faulty SMP hardware?
<BR>
<P>A related problem: IMO it's possible to do the soft irqs to do without
<BR>
turning on/off interrupts all the time, all we have to do is to make sure
<BR>
that only the last interrupt enters do_softirq() (local_irq_count could be
<BR>
used for that) and only at exit of do_softirq() we have to disable
<BR>
interrupts again to check for more pending soft irqs and to finally drop
<BR>
the interrupt context.
<BR>
<P>Partly I did stuff like this already, although for m68k port, but it made
<BR>
it possibly to install _very_ thin realtime layer (the current RTLinux
<BR>
stuff could also be much simpler), basically normal interrupts were only
<BR>
delayed into the soft irq part and only real time interrupts were executed
<BR>
immediatly. That allowed me to install a special serial interrupt handler
<BR>
that could handle the byte stream from the stupid 1-byte-fifo in the Amiga
<BR>
at 57600 bps and more. We have PPC Amigas with 200MHz and more that can't
<BR>
do that under Linux. :-(
<BR>
<P>Ok, I hope that gives some ideas what could be improved (I have more of
<BR>
them :-) ), maybe I can hack something together, that also works on ia32.
<BR>
<P>bye, Roman
