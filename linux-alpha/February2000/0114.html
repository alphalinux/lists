<EM>&gt; &gt; Could you explain me how can 2.3.43 work? How do you do PCI-DMA over 2giga

<EM>&gt; &gt; of ram on the page cache or on the buffer cache or in whatever else DMA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with pci driver that is not yet using the new pci mmu code like some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; network driver is just doing?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If the machine uses drivers that have not been converted, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't work at all.  I disabled that code specifically so that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Pete Rival *could* try a machine with all drivers converted.

<EM>&gt;

<P>I did try it, and sent a failure note to axp-list, yourself, and Jay.  Only Jay
<BR>
responded, but it looks like something was busted in the driver as far as we
<BR>
can tell.  Could very well have been that only Jay got the message - mail out
<BR>
of Compaq was flaky at ZK that day, IIRC.
<BR>
<P>JSYK, it blew up when trying to scan the QLogic 1040B adapters in the system
<BR>
for drives, complaining of SCSI command timeouts.  This is both with the driver
<BR>
in 2.3.42 and the one that was in the vger CVS tree at around the time you sent
<BR>
out your -2 patch.  If someone can point me to a qlogicisp driver that they
<BR>
believe works correctly, I'll give them an answer if I get it before the end of
<BR>
the day today.  (Have to give up the system for other testing for a week at the
<BR>
end of the day.)  Anyone?
