<EM>&gt; after a long while of no concrete work on Milo I tried get it at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compiling with the newest Kernels and - oops - it works nice now, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it doesn't initialize any VGA cards anymore, which might be due to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fact that the vga emulation is c++, and we're using about an equivalent of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the gcc 2.96-80. Not sure about that, though. I plan to have a look into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; old x86emu trials i did and into the xfree86 sources to get the emulation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; code working from there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One other thing is the outdated palcodes. Would it make any sense to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; new palcode sources from the (whatever it's exact term is) firware sdk from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compaq (is there still such a thing, couldn't find it on their web pages
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yet) Are there any legal or technical issues telling me I shouldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; put my work into that? I'm sorry, but I still kept my virginity on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understanding all the pal code sources up to now.. :)

<P>Your message brings up a meta-issue I consider every now and then: 
<BR>
support for older Alpha machines.
<BR>
<P>Is working on MILO the best route?  Maybe we can convince Compaq to let
<BR>
us get SRM going for older machines.  Then we could standardize on SRM
<BR>
for firmware, and aboot for the boot loader.  The bigger problem (IMHO)
<BR>
is that the various alpha platforms have such specialized needs.  I am
<BR>
such a geek that I want to support them all :) but from the perspective
<BR>
of a distro builder, supporting SRM/alphabios/milo/aboot/etc/etc are a
<BR>
real pain.
<BR>
<P>Maybe combine linuxbios+linux[+milo+openbsd?] code to create GPL'd alpha
<BR>
firmware?
<BR>
<P>Comments welcome.  I'm already putting some personal time into keeping
<BR>
the alpha kernel and Mandrake's alpha distro going.  I would be willing
<BR>
to help out here...  I would much rather like milo to morph into
<BR>
firmware proper, than to have to support aboot and milo both as
<BR>
bootloaders...
<BR>
<P>/me should re-subscribe to axp-list :)
