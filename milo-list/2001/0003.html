Hi guys,
<BR>
<P>after a long while of no concrete work on Milo I tried get it at least
<BR>
compiling with the newest Kernels and - oops - it works nice now, but
<BR>
it doesn't initialize any VGA cards anymore, which might be due to the
<BR>
fact that the vga emulation is c++, and we're using about an equivalent of
<BR>
the gcc 2.96-80. Not sure about that, though. I plan to have a look into the
<BR>
old x86emu trials i did and into the xfree86 sources to get the emulation
<BR>
code working from there.
<BR>
One other thing is the outdated palcodes. Would it make any sense to get
<BR>
new palcode sources from the (whatever it's exact term is) firware sdk from
<BR>
compaq (is there still such a thing, couldn't find it on their web pages
<BR>
yet) Are there any legal or technical issues telling me I shouldn't 
<BR>
put my work into that? I'm sorry, but I still kept my virginity on
<BR>
understanding all the pal code sources up to now.. :) 
<BR>
<P>Best regards,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan
