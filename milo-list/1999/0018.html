Hi...
<BR>
<P>I want to generalize milo in 2 steps:
<BR>
<P>1. Make a platform dependant milo link against a generic kernel. This
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;means you have to #define CONFIG_ALPHA_{PLATFORM} only in the milo
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makefile and this selects the correct palcode and dependencies in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;different source files as well as the hard coded hwrpb.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do this, I need to initialize the hwrpb and alpha_mv before I do
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any I/O. Afaik, this means we have no possibility to do any output on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vga/serial in the stub and relocation code. Or should we put
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;initialisation of the hwrpb just that early so we keep the possibility
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to debug this code more easily?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it really neccessary to run the floppy_init_hack() *that* early? In
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my opinion this is something that should logically be called from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;within devices.c
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take from the AARM, that the wrfen PALcode enables the FPU. Why isn't
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this done on Ruffians in __main() of boot_main.c? If it is not really
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;needed, can we through it out for all machine types?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can see, the only critical files containing #ifdefs on 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specific alpha hardware are at the moment cpu.c, boot_main.c,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relocate.c, stub_main.c and of course hwrpb.c
<BR>
<P>2. I don't know much about the ARC stuff, but is it somehow possible to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;determine via ARC, which board/machine is used? I know there's no
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hwrpb, but at least the AlphaBIOS prints out the machine's &quot;name&quot; so 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it must know it, hardcoded or not. The most stupid thing I can imagine
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right now is having ldmilo/linload or milo calculating checksums over
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the firmware or even reading some strings of the firmware directly. In
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any case, this is neither an elegant way nor is it really secure,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because after a firmware update, milo might not be able to boot up a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;box again.. I would love to have a function to give ldmilo a) the name
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the milo to load and possibly the machine type, too.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we could *maybe* do is get the machine type via an ARC environment
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;variable.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the linload Sources I found that the last line executed is (or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should be) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JumpToPal(Linux_Entry);
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can see, this doesn't really swap the PALcode, but only
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jumps into the milo head.S. Otherwise the PALcode gets swapped twice,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;since milo does this again. (This wouldn't really make sense in my
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opinion)
<BR>
<P><P>Now I have some other things:
<BR>
<P>* MILO license. MILO itself is under a free Digital license, the kernel
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;which is linked against milo ist GPL, so I guess the result has to be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;GPL again. Am I wrong? I just don't want to run into problems here.
<BR>
<P>* Future of ARC/AlphaBIOS/ARCS Bios. Now after Compaq seems to have the NT
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;development section freed from their unlucky fate, there's noone who
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;really needs anything but SRM anymore. It might still be interesting to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;continue MILO development to get it flashed into Deskstation ARCS
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;based boxes to get all the modern graphics adapters to work in these
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;nice boxes without running into trouble with Deskstations totally broken
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;BIOS emulation which isn't even worked on anymore, according to several
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;people, including deskstation employees themselves.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any chance that SRM will be ported to machines currently only
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;running with deskstation firmware?
<BR>
<P><P>Please *do* heavily comment on my thoughts.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan.
