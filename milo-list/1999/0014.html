<P><EM>&gt; &gt; At the moment there are several different source trees of milo available
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and every one works for another configuration or has this or that special
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; feature. I think it would be nice to join forces again. 
</EM><BR>
<P>One other thing that could ease confusion for people would be to stop
<BR>
versioning MILO based on the kernel source. I think I have seen a few messages
<BR>
on debian-alpha where people seem to think that if it's called MILO-2.0.35 it
<BR>
must be old.

<EM>&gt; Subject: Re: milo sources?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; GRUB is also worth looking into.  At least the filesystem code is much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cleaner than what we have in MILO.  Perhaps some user interface might be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; useful as well?  GRUB is supposed to be user-friendly, but I never saw
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how it actually works.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've been using GRUB on all my intel boxes since somewhere around version 0.4.
<BR>
I have found it to be an absolute blessing after the mess that is LILO. The
<BR>
menu interface is very simple but easy to use and I think something like that
<BR>
would be useful for MILO also. 
<BR>
<P>One very nice feature of Multiboot is the ability to load kernel modules at
<BR>
boot time. Linux on Intel unfortunately doesn't support Multiboot, mainly
<BR>
because the Linux setup code does a heap of initialisation (notably APM) that
<BR>
must be done in real mode, while GRUB dumps the kernel straight into protected
<BR>
mode. This would not be an issue on Alpha, thus killing ugly hacks like initrd
<BR>
(hurrah).
<BR>
<P>The idea of sharing code with GRUB brings me to the following proposal:
<BR>
<P>GRUB was originally designed as a reference implementation of a
<BR>
Multiboot-complaint bootloader for Intel (see <A HREF="http://www.uruk.org/grub/">http://www.uruk.org/grub/</A> for
<BR>
more information). 
<BR>
<P>What if we did something similar for Alpha? IIRC NetBSD currently suffers from
<BR>
an inability to run on ARC/AlphaBIOS firmware since it needs the OSF PALcode.
<BR>
We could create a Multiboot standard for Alpha (all Multiboot basically
<BR>
involves is loading an ELF executable, possibly some modules and jumping to
<BR>
it) and thus give the BSD guys the benefit of being able to run on all Alpha
<BR>
machines.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 1. Logically separate the UI, filesystems and kernel bootstrap from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rest so that they can be linked against kernel drivers for a full-blown
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MILO as well as against SRM callbacks to provide an aboot-like thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with MILO interface for consistency.
</EM><BR>
<P>Using the filesystem code from GRUB would give us a very compact
<BR>
implementation of ext2, fat and ffs. The only notable one missing is iso9660
<BR>
but I'm sure that could be done. Getting rid of aboot is also a great idea,
<BR>
since it hasn't been updated in years.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3. Separate platform-dependent and platform-independent files.  By
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;platform-dependent&quot; I mean those with #ifdef CONFIG_ALPHA_...; it is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good idea to reduce the number of such files as much as possible.
</EM><BR>
<P>You could go even futher and build MILO and GRUB from common code (like the
<BR>
user interface, filesystems and so on). I *like* this idea...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Should the kernel drivers be compiled as generic or a separate set for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; each system?  I tend to prefer them being generic to simplify the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; process.
</EM><BR>
<P>Definitely generic. For a bootloader we don't need anything special that the
<BR>
platform-specific configuations provide, do we?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 1. The wtint PALcall, which is missing in MILO, although required by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Digital UNIX PALcode specification.  It is a nice power-saving facility.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I implanted it into my MILO as an experimental feature by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reverse-engineering from the SRM PALcode, and this immediately reduced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the CPU fan noise while the machine is idle.  (The kernel needs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; modifications to use wtint, though.)  The problem is that it seems to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; highly platform-specific and I did not see any documentation how to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enter low power mode except for the 21066 family CPUs.
</EM><BR>
<P>Would it be feasible to get an updated PALcode out of Compaq?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3. Ability to run programs under MILO.  This will be useful for various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; console tools such as diagnostic and tuning routines, which we don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to keep inside MILO.
</EM><BR>
<P>Is this just &quot;load an ELF file and jump to it&quot;? Is the interface documented
<BR>
somewhere? Maybe MILO should provide callbacks of some sort?
<BR>
<P>That's all for now... Comments?
