<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't think that &quot;production&quot; (non-debug) MILOs should do any I/O

<EM>&gt; &gt; before passing control to the uncompressed full image.  For the debug

<EM>&gt; &gt; versions even a less than ideal solution should be fine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; True. On the other hand, it's just the debug versions that need debug
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; output. I had rather big problems to determine my errors with exactly no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; output, when I started.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, some debug output in the stub will be useful.  You can link
<BR>
alpha_mv into MILO twice for that purpose (one copy into the compressed
<BR>
image and another one into the stub/decompressor).  Since it's a debug
<BR>
version, some waste of memory doesn't matter.  Alternatively you could
<BR>
put it only into the stub and make the main working image link to it
<BR>
using linker scripts, but it's not worth the effort.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I made some tests on our Ruffians and it seems that at least Jay's hacked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; version of ldmilo ignores the OSLoadFileName. I just entered &quot;blubb&quot; there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (which is the german equivalent of &quot;foo&quot;) and it just loaded &quot;milo&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Having ldmilo interpreting this variable would be very nice. Or we leave
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it as it is now and &quot;misuse&quot; the meaning of it (not that elegant)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>True, ldmilo (originally written by Deskstation) just merely ignores
<BR>
OSLoadFilename, but nothing prevents us from taking linload's source and
<BR>
adapting it to our needs.  The difference between ldmilo and linload is
<BR>
only caused by the absence of the vendor vector (as defined by Digital)
<BR>
in ARCSBIOS.  If I remember correctly, the only thing linload needs from
<BR>
it is Print, and it is replaced in ldmilo by sprintf/Write combination
<BR>
(this is why ldmilo is bigger - it has to carry sprintf's code inside).
<BR>
<P>What I wanted to do was to integrate linload/ldmilo into MILO.  This
<BR>
would drastically simplify whatever remains from linload, since all the
<BR>
file loading would go away: milo.exe will boot straight from ARC.
<BR>
OSLoadFilename would become completely free for our use.  SRM would load
<BR>
milo.exe starting a couple of blocks after the beginning of the file,
<BR>
skipping the NT .exe header and perhaps the code related to booting from
<BR>
ARC.
<BR>
<P>This way the part of MILO responsible for booting from ARC (the
<BR>
remainings of linload) would pass the parameters such as OSLoadOptions
<BR>
straight into the designated area in the MILO, rather than through some
<BR>
peculiar memory location.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I even thought about a single milo for all boxes. This may be to big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though. But one per palcode is a very good idea since it wouldn't be much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bigger. I stripped down my milo from 490k to about 410k. (Only with ncr,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but debug versions. a version linked against the generic kernel is about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 20k bigger at the moment)
</EM><BR>
<P>I think a generic, single MILO is a serious undertaking.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, you are right. On the other hand, we could just &quot;decide&quot; that only a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specific milo is allowed for flashing and a generic milo can be put on an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installation CD for example. ;-&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>True.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Currently MILO swaps PALcode three times (two on MIKASA), which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; clearly redundant.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ups? I only found two of them.. once in boot_main (which is the one not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; executed on MIKASA) and once in devices.c
</EM><BR>
<P>First time it happens in micropal.S at the very end where it jumps to
<BR>
the pal_reset entry of the MILO palcode.  That means all parts of MILO
<BR>
except micropal.S and relocate.c run under MILO palcode.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Why is it sufficient for Mikasa to swap palcodes later? Couldn't we do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that just for the other platforms, too ?
</EM><BR>
<P>I have absolutely no idea why that palcode swap is needed at all.  I
<BR>
guess it has been there since old times when it was really required and
<BR>
nobody wanted to touch it, since it worked.  It's no surprise at all
<BR>
that Mikasa works fine without it!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again, the same for the wrfen at the very beginning of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boot_main.c:__main() - if it's not neccessary (or possible) on Ruffian, is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it really neccessary on other boards? I'd like to get the boot process a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bit more stripped down and/or explained for a real release of the current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; code.
</EM><BR>
<P>I avoided that question simply because I don't know.  I don't understand
<BR>
how wrfen() can break things.  The only person I know of who can shed some
<BR>
light here is Jay Estabrook.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well.. I just read the LICENSE file and it seems to state that everything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; except the PALcode and the BIOS emulation is GPL. The headers of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sources on the other hand give not a single statement about GPL.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, I'm not a lawyer, but my understanding is that in case of
<BR>
contradicting licences you can choose whatever you want, though my
<BR>
feeling is that it's safer to choose the more restrictive one.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What shall I do now with files that I threw away and rewrote completely?
</EM><BR>
<P>Put them under GPL.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I sometimes took the kernel source and just copied the function headers to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be sure what it refers to in the kernel. On the other hand, I did the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the milo sources. For example, I took the entry.S of the kernel and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stripped it down until it fitted my needs. What license header do I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to put in the file before release?
</EM><BR>
<P>Whatever the kernel licence allows you to.  I think it's safe just to
<BR>
say it's GPL.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't think that anyone would give this a wrong sense, but as I had lots
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of contract problems with buerocratic german publishers, I try to be kind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of aware now :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Can you ask SuSE's lawyers?  Lawyers tend to be very conservative and
<BR>
interpret every nuance in the worst possible sense, but the advices they
<BR>
give are bulletproof.  You might also try to persuade Digital
<BR>
authorities to resolve this licensing mess somehow...
