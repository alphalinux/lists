Hi.
<BR>
<P>I am currently thinking about releasing my MILO tree now rather than later
<BR>
to get it heavily tested. It should with very little changes be at least
<BR>
at the same point as milo linked against 2.0 kernels, but of course the
<BR>
source didn't really get easier and there's no real advantage except you
<BR>
can use the new drivers and you don't need an old 2.0 source tree on your
<BR>
hard disk.
<BR>
<P>Whether I do this depends mainly on your arguements and wishes. The
<BR>
average user hasn't been compiling his own milo until now and I guess this
<BR>
won't change in near future.
<BR>
<P>Should I announce it on the redhat-axp list? (I fear a bit that everyone
<BR>
expects this to be much better than the old milo, but it's currently not
<BR>
more than working about as good as the old one)
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan
