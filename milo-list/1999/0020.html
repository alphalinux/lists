<EM>&gt; Hi...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I want to generalize milo in 2 steps:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1. Make a platform dependant milo link against a generic kernel. This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    means you have to #define CONFIG_ALPHA_{PLATFORM} only in the milo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Makefile and this selects the correct palcode and dependencies in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    different source files as well as the hard coded hwrpb.
</EM><BR>
<P>..and the machine vector.
<BR>
<P>Good idea: this way kernel bits and most of MILO will have to be
<BR>
compiled only once in a multi-platform build.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    To do this, I need to initialize the hwrpb and alpha_mv before I do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    any I/O. Afaik, this means we have no possibility to do any output on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    vga/serial in the stub and relocation code.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why do you need HWRPB for I/O?  Alpha_mv alone should suffice, and it
<BR>
will be statically linked into MILO anyway.
<BR>
<P>I don't think that &quot;production&quot; (non-debug) MILOs should do any I/O
<BR>
before passing control to the uncompressed full image.  For the debug
<BR>
versions even a less than ideal solution should be fine.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2. I don't know much about the ARC stuff, but is it somehow possible to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    determine via ARC, which board/machine is used?  I know there's no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    hwrpb, but at least the AlphaBIOS prints out the machine's &quot;name&quot; so 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    it must know it, hardcoded or not.
</EM><BR>
<P>Apparently yes, at least as a string of characters: see
<BR>
GetConfigurationData call in the firmware vector.  There is also
<BR>
ReturnExtendedSystemInformation in the vendor vector which provides
<BR>
system information in more reasonable form, but it is not available on
<BR>
the Deskstation ARCS firmware.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    I would love to have a function to give ldmilo a) the name
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    of the milo to load and possibly the machine type, too.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    What we could *maybe* do is get the machine type via an ARC environment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    variable.
</EM><BR>
<P>ARC passes SystemPartition, OSLoadFilename, OSLoadPartition, and
<BR>
OSLoadOptions to linload/ldmilo.  IIRC, current practice is that
<BR>
OSLoadFilename points to the MILO image file and OSLoadOptions get
<BR>
passed as arguments to the kernel.  You probably can stick additional
<BR>
information into OSLoadFilename after the MILO filename, if you really
<BR>
need it.
<BR>
<P>Are you thinking of doing more generic MILOs - e.g., one MILO per
<BR>
PALcode?  What exactly possibilities are there for different system
<BR>
types that a single MILO can serve?  Maybe they are detectable by the
<BR>
MILO itself?
<BR>
<P>I don't like to rely on anything from the console, as it makes it harder
<BR>
to eventually support flashable MILOs.  Information obtained from the
<BR>
firmware should be used only as a convenience (e.g., for autoboot), not
<BR>
for vital decisions such as system type or memory size.  It might be
<BR>
nice, for instance, to fill HWRPB's DSR with the symbolic system name
<BR>
obtained through GetConfigurationData(): there is nothing in the system
<BR>
that depends on it, but it will show up nicely in /proc/cpuinfo.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    In the linload Sources I found that the last line executed is (or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    should be) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 			JumpToPal(Linux_Entry);
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    As far as I can see, this doesn't really swap the PALcode, but only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    jumps into the milo head.S.
</EM><BR>
<P>Head.S?  I thought it was micropal.S.  The idea at this stage is not to
<BR>
swap the PALcode, but rather pass the control to MILO in PALmode so it
<BR>
can relocate itself to where it wants to be and *then* swap to its
<BR>
PALcode, after it has been put in its permanent place.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    Otherwise the PALcode gets swapped twice,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    since milo does this again. (This wouldn't really make sense in my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    opinion)
</EM><BR>
<P>Currently MILO swaps PALcode three times (two on MIKASA), which is
<BR>
clearly redundant.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now I have some other things:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * MILO license. MILO itself is under a free Digital license, the kernel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   which is linked against milo ist GPL, so I guess the result has to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   GPL again. Am I wrong? I just don't want to run into problems here.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not an expert so I can't advise on this, but I think you're right.
<BR>
There is however one nasty clause in the Digital's licence that requires
<BR>
anybody who makes changes to the code to &quot;prominently mark&quot; those
<BR>
modifications &quot;as not part of the original&quot;.  What a nuisance!
<BR>
<P>I had an idea to overcome it with a statment saying that the original
<BR>
code is on gatekeeper.dec.com and that you can run diff and see exactly
<BR>
what changes have been made, but it is not what I'd actually call
<BR>
&quot;prominent&quot; marking...
<BR>

<BR>
