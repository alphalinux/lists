<P>Excellent.

<EM>&gt;   which is linked against milo ist GPL, so I guess the result has to be

<EM>&gt;   GPL again. Am I wrong? I just don't want to run into problems here.
</EM><BR>
<P>If they are linked together yes, AFAIK.  [disclaimer:  not a lawyer :)]

<EM>&gt;   continue MILO development to get it flashed into Deskstation ARCS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   based boxes to get all the modern graphics adapters to work in these

<EM>&gt;   BIOS emulation which isn't even worked on anymore, according to several

<EM>&gt;   people, including deskstation employees themselves.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Is there any chance that SRM will be ported to machines currently only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   running with deskstation firmware?
</EM><BR>
<P>A flash-able MILO would be difficult to maintain, but very useful to
<BR>
have.  It would be nice if ARC or AlphaBIOS could be open sourced... 
<BR>
Several of Jay Estabrook's comments on MILO, long long ago, mention that
<BR>
MILO really doesn't have the support necessary to be fully functional
<BR>
[for Linux's purposes] firmware.
